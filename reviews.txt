UPDATE, BUILD QUALITY:<br/><br/>Well, I'll be damned, its been exactly a year since I wrote this. It was pure luck that I checked my reviews today.<br/><br/>Anyway, build quality.<br/><br/>The M20xs I bought a year ago are still going strong, and I use them constantly when I am not on my computer. The cable is fine, the gold plating has worn off of the plug (that's normal after a lot of use), and the plastic doesn't appear to be worn. If I cleaned this thing very well, it would look brand new. However, not everything is in perfect condition, and that would be the padding.<br/><br/>I started to notice after a while that the earcups were starting to feel harder and harder. As a sanity check, I took a look at my dad's m50xs to see if they were still soft, and they were (he doesn't use them that much anymore). I looked into it, and apparently, the fake rubber-leather stuff Audio Technica uses in their earcups slowly deteriorates over time by getting harder and eventually cracking due to the stress of cushioning. This is a result of constant contact with body oils (this is why my dad's pair is still soft). Thankfully, these are replaceable, but they are $25 for a pair, which is quite a bit. I got these headphones for $30 dollars while they were on sale, for perspective. There is also the chance that they use some cheaper earcups in the m20xs, which wouldn't surprise me. In which case, the replacement earcups for the m50xs could be considered an upgrade.<br/><br/>What is more worrisome is the headband. Unlike the m50xs, which have a higher quality rubber on the headband, the headband on the m20xs is made out of the same material the earcups are. You can't replace it. Although its unlikely that the headband will get severely damaged from cracking since it doesn't exactly cushion, I can still see some dents in mine that don't go away.<br/><br/>Other than that, these are still my favorite general purpose headphones, and I still recommend them. I'm on the edge of replacing the earcups though. If it does break at some point, I might aim for the m40xs due to the shorter cable options, better build quality/materials, and better sound. I'll give it two more years and see what happens to them.<br/><br/>REVIEW:<br/><br/>So, I have never been wealthy enough to own a good pair of headphones. Hearing about the constant praise of Audio-Technica, I decided to pick of their budget pair of monitors, the ATH-M20x. My father has a pair of their M40x or 50x, but I am pretty much not allowed to touch them. That's why I can't say which ones they are.<br/><br/>As perspective and for comparison, the main headphones I used before these were the Sol-Republic v8 tracks, and I use a Logitech G230 gaming headset currently for my desktop.<br/><br/>The song I tested between these headphones was Ocean Man by Ween, because of the formidable range in pitch. I also remembered the song the day I did this, so it was a bit nostalgic for me to listen to it again.<br/><br/>SOUND QUALITY:<br/><br/>Now, the first thing that struck me with these headphones was that the bass was much less compared to the other headphones. Now, this isn't a bad thing, because it let me focus on the other tracks in the song, such as the guitar and percussion, which became much brighter. This made the song sound much clearer than my other headphones, which lacked a little in mids and highs.  My Sols overall had much more bass, but the rest of the frequencies seemed filtered out because of it. It's mostly the same story with my g230s, but the highs are much better than the sols. Realizing this, I finally figured out why I couldn't hear footsteps very well in the game Counter Strike Global Offensive, which encourages me to buy another pair of the M20x for my desktop, as well as a mic. The only real issue I have with the M20x at this point is that I cannot hear bass drums very well if they aren't mixed loud enough, which is disappointing, as percussion is one of the most important factors in music to me. Overall, these have generally amazing performance in the audio range, despite the bass seeming only a tad bit weaker than it should be. If they boosted up a tiny bit, I would be satisfied. Not worth to take a star off however, especially for the price.<br/><br/>Another thing to note is that these headphones are higher in impedance than normal, so I have to near max out my volume on my phone to get somewhere acceptable to me. This isn't a problem, but I'm afraid I may get some distortion in some songs. This is also sad, as I use a separate Creative Zen audio player for my high quality CD rips, which don't go as loud as my phone, making it essentially useless. They also don't really like to plug into my phone with the case on, so I have to jam it in the jack and hope it doesn't spring out. This is along with the other problem with my audio jack, which is that they always think I'm using an inline mic unless I unplug and re-plug and hope they see them as regular headphones. If it doesn't, then bumping the cord can cause google to start voice detecting, which is very annoying, as well as randomly pausing and playing a song. To reinforce it, this is a problem with my PHONE, not the plug. This is more of a me problem, however, they still have issues being plugged into a phone with a case. Making the end coned and the adapter it comes with internally coned would solve this problem.<br/><br/>BUILD QUALITY:<br/><br/>Now, one of main reasons why I bought a g230 was because they are very well built, and could take multiple falls off of my desk. Same goes for the Sols, which are pretty much designed like a tank due to the super strong headband and hard but not brittle plastic. The M20x however, seems like it would need a bit more care with the headband, since it is not topped with plastic. I usually just throw my Sols into my backpack everyday, because it can handle it. These will need a bit of extra attention to not tear up the foam on the headband. I tried buying a 
<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/hard-case-from-Caseling/dp/B00LZ3VFW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">hard case from Caseling</a>
, but the description lied to me and said that these headphones would fit. They didn't, and now I have to return it as soon as possible to get my 13 bucks back. They do fit my dad's well though because they fold, and is a pretty good case. Otherwise, the ABS plastic is nice on the drivers making them strong, and the headband has spring steel metal in it. There are no visible defects anywhere, not even unmixed plastics or rough spots on the foam. This is fairly impressive for a product made in Taiwan. Another thing I would have liked would be to color the logo inset on the sides of the drivers, it would make it easier to see. I assume this is to differentiate different models.<br/><br/>Now, the cord I have a bit of an issue with. The cord itself is very nice; it's well insulated and flexible. The jack is nice too, it appears gold plated and has a nice bend protector. The issue I have is that it's way to freaking long, at a staggering 3 meters. This may be a good thing for some people, but I am going to be walking around with these. I have to coil up the wire (thank god for that insulation) and put a cable management strip on it to shorten it. Now, there is a good 4 inch diameter coil in my pocket that is 1/2 an inch thick, and is VERY annoying. If they could have at least shortened it to maybe 1 meter, I would not be writing this. This is worth a star for me, so off it goes. Despite this, the cable has to be one of the best impeding headphone cables I have encountered, keeping out eddy currents very well, which would cause distortion with the huge coil I have to lug around. A good way to test if a cable is well insulated or not is to try and use the cable as a stylus on a touch screen. If the screen reacts in any way while playing music, the cable has failed the test. No matter how I tried, looping it, squishing it against the screen, it would not be detected. That is a good sign for a good cable, as no electrical fields are going through that thing. As a solution to the coil, I may do some research on the internals of the cord, and shorten it myself. If you are also hateful of this issue, the better ATH models have interchangeable cables that can be much shorter. To me, it isn't worth it to pay 30 to 40 extra dollars for that feature.<br/><br/>COMFORT:<br/><br/>So, my g230s are a very comfortable pair of headphones for me to wear, as they are over ears. My Sols on the other hand are on ear, which was a huge issue to me when I bought them. It's not that they were uncomfortable, but it was because of an odd problem I have with my right ear. My ear canals are extremely small, so I can't use earbuds, which is really my main reason of buying full on headphones. In this case, the Sols would squeeze my right ear shut! There would be no music to my right ear unless I physically held the driver, and stretched my ear a bit. Now, the M20x are also over ear, so that's great for me. It's actually the main reason why I bought these, I wanted a nice pair of over ears that would not impede my hearing. Not only this, I would say they fit even better than my g230s due to the many degrees of freedom, so I am extremely happy here. My issue was solved due to these headphones. The actual foam the headphones use is nice, definitely on the drivers. The headband foam on top is durable and a bit stiff, but not noticeable. The bottom foam seems the same as the drivers, so no problem there. All of the foam seems to be wrapped in a thin fake leather material, and it feels nice. My g230s are just wrapped in perforated fabric, which makes it a tad itchy.<br/><br/>MY OWN JUDGEMENT:<br/><br/>Now, because I like nice things, I want it obvious what I'm using is nice and worth it. I like to make a statement, so I buy things that fall under these categories:<br/><br/>1. Looks cool<br/>2. Does it's job well<br/>3. Lasts a long time<br/><br/>So, for it looking cool, I would say "eh." As I previously stated, the logo isn't painted in, so they just look like headphones from afar. My Sols on the other hand, look 100% sweet, with it's circular drivers, solid looking headband, minimalist logo, and shiny plating (that wore off around the edges of the drivers, sadly). These don't have that aesthetic I'm looking for, but they do look like monitors, which kind of makes up for it. To me, they just look intermediate, not pro.<br/><br/>For doing the job well, that is a definite yes. The cool factor to me can immediately be vetoed in the case that something works like a well oiled machine. This is that case. They just sound good, and anyone who would borrow these would tell. My sols aren't that good sounding, and my g230 is okay, so these are technically the best headphones I own at the moment. A case where this wouldn't be true would be Beats by Dre. Yes, the headphones look very nice, iconic even. Despite this, they pretty much are just a step up from those 5 dollar Koss headphones you buy at drug stores when you have nothing else to use (those headphones are very good for the price though, so I like them for that).<br/><br/>I don't know for certain yet if these will last a long time. This is another factor that directly goes with doing the job well, as having these factors multiply each other makes for a godly product. My Sols and g230s definitely fall under this category, as they have both lasted me 2 years. The Sols are almost done for, however, as the right driver's plastic cone buzzes on certain frequencies. The g230s look literally brand new and haven't degraded audio wise, so they have served me well, and will keep doing so. Beats by Dre also do not fall under this factor, as they must be treated like kings, or either they will shatter the moment you look at them (an anecdote from a friend). Because it misses the two most important factors, Beats headphones are useless to me, especially with the price they ask for. I will have to live with the M20xs for a while to see how well they do with this factor, and I am predicting another strong yes. And even if they only last me a couple months, they are still only $30, an amazing price for what these headphones are. One thing I realized that may break them is extending the drivers over and over again. The metal tracks that are attached to them go in and out of the headband, and you can feel them moving inside through the foam. You can even pinch it and make it really hard to move it (annoying sometimes), which means they aren't encased in anything. This leads me to predict that at some point, they will poke through the band. Because of this, I will not shorten them every time I stow them away. Someone posted a picture that looked like this happened to them, so I will watch out.<br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/><br/>These are an amazing pair of headphones that meet many of my quality standards, as I am a bit of a snob. They sound great, but bass drums can be too quiet or hard to distinguish. They are made very well, despite the freaking long cable and too thick of an end for the jack. They are very comfortable, and solved the issues I had with other headphones I owned. They succeed my personal checklist, but I will need to test for durability. So, as a final statement: if you are on a budget and want nice over ears for sitting down and listening to music, pick up a pair of ATH-M20X headphones. If you have more money, shoot for the M40x or m50x if you want to walk around or need better quality. I am pretty satisfied despite my current situation, so I hope you can enjoy these headphones more than me.

I bought these for my keyboard and the airplane.  I live in an apartment and want to be nice to my neighbors with my keyboard playing.  The sound quality is pretty good, read some of the other reviews, and are very good when I want to listen to music.  I thought they would be nice on the plane to muffle the noise, these are not noise canceling, and allow me to listen to music with a quality headphone that's not expensive.  Great deal.  Fits small jack and comes with a larger jack adapter.
----
I have ordered and returned three other earphones. They would be five stars if it wasn't for not having volume control. They are comfortable, and to me, have good sound. The one thing that doesn't work very well is the 3.5mm plug. I don't know what China uses to measure things, especially clothes, but it is very loose. It works on my tablet but falls out of my phone. Just a couple of things keep it from being a five star rating.

I needed a new set of over the ear closed back studio headphones, but didn't wanna spend lots of money, as it's not really necessary. These do the job well enough for me. When I plugged them into my phone, I was initially disappointed, but when I used them in the studio, as they're meant to be used for, is where they really shined. I compared them to my other headphones that are 4x expensive and the AT pair actually sounded better. I like them because there is no added bass, which you don't want added bass using them as studio headphone monitors, cause you want the true sound of whatever you're tracking so you can adjust sounds accordingly. If you're looking for a pair of listening headphones, like for your phone, etc, this would not be the pair I'd suggest. But, if you're looking for some inexpensive headphones for tracking then these are a good option. I would like for them to be a little louder, that's why I overall rated them 4/5 stars.

So I got these yesterday, and I know I am not going to keep them for long (more on that later) so I want to get this review in ASAP. First off, while I know what I like &amp; I can recognize quality, I am definitely NOT an audiophile, so I'm not going to try &amp; tell you in TECHNICAL terms why these headphones are so great, but I can give a layman's perspective. Also, I am going to do a lot of comparing to the Samson SR850's I just bought AND my standby Koss PortaPros (which I compared the Samson's to in my review of them) Anyway, lets get started.<br/><br/>First of all the looks of these. My 13 year old daughter unboxed them while I was at work &amp; immediately exclaimed "These are NICE !" With that, she put them on, plugged in her iPod Touch &amp; didn't take them off until I got home several hours later. This from a kid who's favorite headphones are a purple pair of Knockoff Beats I bought at a flea market. They are MUCH better looking than the Samsons. The earcups are smaller &amp; lower profile, and the headband is covered in a stylish black leatherette. There is a LARGE AudioTechnica logo across the top of them, but who's going to be looking at the top of your head ?<br/><br/>As far as comfort goes, they are very comfortable, They are much lighter than the Samson's, and as I said smaller. The ear pads are suitably soft &amp; covered in the same leather like material as the headband. And while I doubt you could lie on your side comfortably with them on, they would be MORE comfortable than the Samson's in that position.<br/><br/>As for build quality, they are REALLY light, which worries me a bit, but they seem very solid. The main structure is definitely metal and the wires are thick &amp; well covered. The plugs also look a step up from your average headphone connector. While I am sure my kids would manage to break them eventually, I think they would last longer than your average headphone. And with me, they will be just fine.<br/><br/>Finally, lets talk sound. They sound AWESOME ! Really awesome. Much better than headphones at this price should sound. When I listened to the Samson's the first time I knew they sounded better than my Koss' ... but not by a lot. These are OBVIOUSLY better. The bass response is better, and everything else is CRYSTAL CLEAR ! Just stunning. That being said, they are not as loud as the Samson's which kinda surprised me since they are smaller &amp; closed back. But because of the better bass &amp; improvements across the full range of sound, I would definitely put these ahead of the Samson's AND the Koss' &amp; I am sure ANYONE who heard them all side by side by side would agree.<br/><br/>Now there are a few negatives. Like I said they are smaller &amp; Lighter than the Samson's. And I was looking for something LARGER ... so in that respect, they are going away from what I was looking for. And I still am surprised the Samsons are slightly louder. With the bigger size they should need more power to drive them properly. But since the M20's have less sound leak than the SR850's, this is really a non-issue.<br/><br/>And while they are very comfortable, after wearing them for a short time its clear that my ears are sweating in the M20's where they were not in the SR850's. Again, it may be because the latter are semi-open, but I think its because of the cloth covering on the SR850's pads AND because they are bigger.<br/><br/>Overall, even with the negatives, I would recommend these over the Samson SR850's w/o question. But, if that extra $15.00 means a lot to you, the Samson's are still an EXCELLENT Choice. And they will probably be my choice, since once my son HEARS these. he will be wanting to trade me the Samson's for them.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I have had these for just about 36 hours &amp; I just had a perfect stranger come up to me &amp; ask me if I liked them.l He obviously knew a lot more about headphones than I do &amp; has much better equipment (a $170 pair of BeyerDynamics) but he was impressed with these especially at the price.<br/><br/>UPDATE to the UPDATE: I recently bought a Fiio E6 Headphone Amp &amp; when my son comes home from College, I will try these out with the Amp. Considering how much they improved my Samson SR850's (I would put that combination AHEAD of these now) I am sure they will sound even more awesome. However,  I will NOT be buying that Amp for my son. If he wants one, he can buy it himself.<br/><br/>IN RESPONSE TO .... the two questions .... First off the Amp improves the M20's as much as it improves the Samson SR850's. The sound is cleaner, and I prefer using the degraded setting on the amp with increased volume on my source on these as well.<br/><br/>Second, as I said without the amp, these sound nearly as good as the Samson's WITH the amp. So I feel I have done enough for my son in that respect. If he wants to UP the quality with the amp, that's his choice. Just because I am not paying for it, doesn't represent my feeling for him one way or another. Of maybe it does. Either way I feel secure in my role as a parent &amp; the opinion of one crank won't affect that.

Very happy with these ATH-M20X headphones. I bought them to get a sample of what the ATH-M50X might generally sound like.  I prefer these to my Sennheiser HD 599 SE which cost 3x more. The ATH-M20X have the mids and to a certain extent the highs which are missing from the HD 599's. If you want to hear ALL the music these are for you. I love hearing accentuations I've never heard in recordings I've listened to many times before. If you like bass heavy don't buy these. They aren't lacking in bass, the just aren't bass heavy.
----
I bought this headphone because I wanted to get away from my three noise cancelling headphones because they make me dizzy. In case of interest, search for "eardrum suck".
----
It has proven as a good investment and quality product.<br/>Already recommended to family and friends.<br/>Hope to get more than a year and half usage from the headphone.

I've had these headphones for almost 6 months now and so far, no complaints. The noise cancellation is as close to perfect as you can realistically get. The battery life is absolutely insane; I can count on one hand the amount of times I've actually had to charge them. The design itself is also really sleek and they're very comfortable to wear. The sound itself is also very immersive and plenty loud yet still won't pierce your ears and damage your hearing even at full volume. Pls do not wear these when working out cus the the synthetic leather on the cups is not designed to withstand excessive moisture, especially from heavy sweating.  And with the XM5's out these are a bargain and perform every bit as well as the new models. I personally like the design of these much better than the XM5's since they also fold for easy storage whereas the new ones do not. Also the manufacturer threw in a free power bank as well. Although they gave me an energizer one instead of the anker one that was advertised but that's fine since it looks just as good and works just as well so that's not an issue at all. All in all great purchase can't wait to use these on a plane. Get them while you still can, cannot recommend these enough
----
Sound: good. Battery: good. Comfort: average.<br/>Bad: app and controls.<br/>The headphones won’t work without the app, and the app is useless aside from tracking our usage which I strongly dislike. The touchpad controls on the earcup is unpredictable and annoying: when the headphones are around the neck the slightest touch from the chin/cheeks will play/pause the sound.<br/><br/>All in all, good sound but annoying, overwrought, gadget riddled product. Slightly disappointed.
----
I didn't think it was possible to eliminate so much noise! Would be interesting to see if Sony can beat this model with even better noise cancellation!
----
I am so happy with this purchase. They are comfy to wear, light weight and the sound quality is fantastic.<br/>I am also very impressed with the battery life. I would most definitely recommend these!

I have had these for over a month now and I use these M-F at my job to help cancel out some noisy pipes as I work in a hospital basement and the steam pipes can be quit loud. It does not 100% cancel them out but they fade into the background with no music going and if I am playing ANY audio at all I cannot hear the pipes at all. Also the connect to two devices feature is super nifty and handy for switching between a youtube video on my laptop to watching a snapchat or tiktok sent by my friends on my phone. They are super lightweight without feeling cheap like the cheaper versions of sonys noise canceling headphones, and do not cause me a headache at all, I will say the ear cups hold a bit of heat so if you are going to use these for workouts just know they are not the most breathable earcups but that's because they are mean to isolate exterior noise and that typically means giving up the breathability.<br/><br/>The ability to customize the passive listening and speak to pause  media features in the app is a huge plus, i have it focus on voices so i dont hear the ambient noise but if someone walks into my office i can hear them start to talk to me and if i start talking it will auto pause my music/ media and a double tap on the side will start it back up once im done with the conversation<br/>TWO THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE BUYING<br/>1- If you are having issues with it stuttering go into the mobile app and switch it to "prioratize stable connection" you will not notice a difference in the audio quality i swear,<br/>2- If using with a laptop like I am and you use a bluetooth mouse or anything that *might* cause some interference. Every once in a while my audio will go a bit choppy but as soon as I unplug the bluetooth adapter for my wireless mouse it stops. NOTE THIS IS A BLUETOOTH DEVICE ISSUE NOT JUST SONY. its because the bluetooth signals get a lil jumbled and can mess each other up. It does not happen all the time just intermittently

These headphones work great with tele and video conferencing platforms. I wish I had purchased them during Prime day since the product was discounted significantly.  A bit pricey but worth it.

If I had read the Amazon reviews I probably wouldn't have bought it, namely the top review where complaints about critical things I need like BT pairing with a laptop and VOIP call quality being terrible would've put me off.<br/><br/>That being said though I've had none of those issues! The headphones paired perfectly with my phone, and my laptop (simultaneously). Call quality was leagues better than my QC35's on both devices, pairing was effortless albeit a bit slow (took a few more seconds than I'm accustomed to) and I didn't have to play with weird input devices like the other reviewer mentioned. It just, worked.<br/><br/>Call Quality:<br/>Normal calls, WhatsApp calls, video calls (phone) or VOIP (laptop) were all equally clear. No issues concerning choosing the correct mic in Windows or Teams. Even with my airconditioner on full blast right above my desk I was clear to other call participants who didn't even notice. I was mostly interested in this feature as I take a number of calls for work and they really delivered a smooth and painless experience.<br/><br/>Music:<br/>Music quality was great, rich bass, and the noise cancelling was adaptable depending on the ambient noise you were experiencing at the time, rather than cranking it up to max and leaving it there. I enjoy music but it isn't my primary reason for getting the headset.<br/><br/>BT Range:<br/>This was a sore point on my previous headset, but these kept a great connection despite being a room or two away through concrete walls. Allows me to pop to the kitchen during calls without dropping a connection or experiencing any audio quality issues. It remained clear at all times.<br/><br/>Fit and Finish:<br/>They feel luxurious, the outer coating is nice and soft but more importantly the headset feels light so wearing them for hours while at work in between calls without feeling the need to remove them is easy (although a small note on this later*).<br/><br/>Nothing in life is perfect so here are the negatives:<br/>The haptic controls, they work, kinda. The volume up and down is fine, but double tapping to answer or pause is a bit "hit-and-miss". It does eventually get it if you keep trying and sometimes it gets it immediately but it isn't consistent.<br/>The earcups aren't terribly deep so if you have bigger ears or they are more pronounced you will be up against the inner cup which means wearing them for hours on end may end up being irritating. *They also get quite warm but not unbearable - in reference to wearing them for a few hours.<br/><br/>Overall very happy I got them on sale ($255 without import duties) with the power bank, it was an extremely worthwhile purchase and one I would recommend to others.

I have extreme noise sensitivity and fairly intense anxiety and at the end of my day, I need something that can just allow my brain not to have to process noise and these headphones have exceeded my expectations. The noise cancelling just right for me. Some people may not think it is the best, but most noise cancelling headphones just make me feel like cotton is being shoved in my ear and vibrated, so these are very nice. The ability to choose sound cancelling or ambient noise at different levels is delightful and allows for a variety of sound levels depending on your mood/what you are doing.<br/><br/>The sound quality is very good. You also have the ability through the app to change sound equalization based on if you are listening to a show or listening to music, which is a very convenient feature.<br/><br/>The battery charged very fast and I've been wearing them for 4 hours now and the battery hasn't dropped from 100%. The swipe gestures are very easy to follow and they are neither too sensitive or under sensitive. When connected to my phone, all the swipe gestures work, however when connected to my TV, the play/pause doesn't function, but that may be due to the fact that my apps stream through an Xbox and it may not be compatible, so I'm not going to dock any stars for it.<br/><br/>The headphones themselves are also very comfortable. The ear cups are just big enough and I have fairly big ear for a woman of my size. The headband is sufficiently padded as are the ear cups. The weight of the headphones is also acceptable very light, which is great for long wear. So far my head feels slightly sore, but I wear headphones for my work, so the spot is sensitive to begin with, so again, no stars off.<br/><br/>All and all, I would highly recommend these for anyone who wants a very high quality set of headphones that are easy to use, sturdy, and exactly as advertised.

Best headphones I ever had

Judging by the majority of audiophile reviews of these on YouTube, these are well tuned, reasonably "detailed" with very average for the price "technicalities", mediocre build pair of headphones.<br/><br/>I disagree. First, materials are awesome - great plastics, great headband, very hygienic, 7/10 comfortable.<br/><br/>Pads are almost great - they lack like maybe a couple of millimeters of depth for my ears, though they're sewed smartly, and plush, and easy to clean.<br/><br/>The adjustment and folding mechanism looks junky on videos, while in the real life it's sturdy, clicks are very precise, controllable, the joint seems sturdy.<br/><br/>And these are very, very compact when folded - I carry them in my fanny pack, this is ridiculously convenient for a full size headphones.<br/><br/>Cables suck, all three of them, they're like kings of microphonic effect, you need a replacement. Btw, choose Hart Audio cables, they're awesome.<br/><br/>If it's hot, you need an AC in the room, since in 2-3 hours K371 will become hot and sweaty. Plus, since they slightly touch my pinna, I can wear them like 4 hours tops.<br/><br/>And no amp is needed, you can drive them out your finger probably.<br/><br/>Sound isolation is mediocre - I found it worse compared to Elegia and DT770.<br/><br/>Ok, now sound.<br/><br/>Out of the box AKG K371 sucks. Like a lot. It's like really bad. It's dry. It's low bass. It's shouty. It doesn't make any sense at all.<br/><br/>But give them time. I don't know if that's pads burn-in, your brain's burn-in or driver burn-in and it doesn't matter actually. The fact it - that you need to run them on your head for quite a while to get to the point when they start to sound good.<br/><br/>And OMG they change. I do have DCA AEON Open Flow RT, DT770 250Om and Focal Elegia, plus I have experience with many other cans and iems in very different pricing brackets.<br/><br/>AKG K371 shocked me. I couldn't believe my ears.<br/><br/>They're very balanced overall, mids are tight, natural, vocals are distinct, natural and well placed - not too far, not too "intimate".<br/>Brass instruments and electric guitars got some very pleasant bite.<br/><br/>Bass is just how I like it - it's neutral. And yes, there is a very, very notable rise in sub-bass, but that's really much closer to how speakers sound in real life.<br/><br/>Highs do not attract much of my attention, they're balanced. You can hear hits on hi-hats, you can hear a pretty ok decay on cymbals, there is nothing bothering me at any volume level (I'm looking at you, almost every other headphone I've heard).<br/><br/>They're reasonably wide, way outside your head and there is a perceived soundstage depth, not to Elegia's level, but K371 is not flat at all in this department. Just place them kind of slightly forward on your ear and you're fine.<br/><br/>Regarding the detail - I don't know, really. I don't feel that my planars or Elegia, both EQed to Harman and non EQed, are like more or less "detailed". I'd say I stopped listening my DCA AFO RT, that's for sure and I LOVED that headphone. Now AKG spoiled them for me and just can't.<br/><br/>Elegia is still a thing of it's own and makes a lot of sense compared to AKG still. Elegia is the punchiest headphone I heard ever, it's textured and "physical" and no one else is close (I never auditioned 900MK2 or first gen HE-6). K371 is not flat, they're also reasonably textured, and that bite on brass is not available on Elegia, not to speak of light weight and portability of AKG. And the price.<br/><br/>AKG K371 is better that Beyerdynamic DT770 250OM in almost every aspect. DT770 still got a ton of spare parts, a bigger comfy earcup and the stock cable is significantly better.<br/><br/>I apply Oratory 1990 EQ to K371, but only up from 1KHz, changes are minor, but improvement is noticeable.<br/><br/>With no EQ they actually do not sound "close" and with Oratory's EQ up from 1KHz they disappear slightly more. I know, right? No one was telling me that in any review.<br/><br/>To sum it up. AKG K371 broke my 15+ years of audiophile experience. I'm puzzled, pleasantly surprised and don't know what to think.<br/><br/>It looks as neutral FR is almost everything, with some place for speculation in punchiness and soundstage topics.<br/><br/>I don't know. Like, buy these, try them out, give them time, be open minded, don't listen to overs, don't look at the price, be ready to change your opinion and accept that your previous experiences, opinions and spending stopped making any sense.<br/><br/>I had a dream, that a perfect sound will become available to anyone sometime far in the future, but apparently that future is now.

After doing some internet research I found the K371 to be the right headphone for me, but curiosity got the best of me when I was researching replacement pads for it. Some reviewers claimed that the pads were different between the BT and none BT models, however Dekoni claims the same pad works for both devices as well as the K361. Turns out the pads are exactly the same, though the felt experience is a bit different on the BT models because of the thicker ear cups.<br/><br/>Other differences to note:<br/>(1) Sound - if you weren't doing a side by side you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between how the two sound, however the K371 seems slightly more rich in classical and folk music and the bass is cleaner to my ears. It also sounded like there was a click or very brief rattle in the BT model when heavy base hit, such as in Vaishiyas song "Arped". This may have been a defect, or it may be the BT module adding to the dynamic sound environment in an unpleasant way. Additionally, I had a weird channel separation sensation in my ears with the BT model that went away after a few hours of play time.<br/>(2) Cable/Connectors - The K371-BT uses a 4-pin XLR connector for the cable whereas the K371 uses a more common 3-pin XLR. The 4-pin cable having more conductors in the wire is also more stiff and unpleasant, as you may be able to see in the picture. FYI - the K361 uses a smaller aux connector, probably a 2.5mm, which actually makes more sense for the BT model since the 2.5mm female end takes up less space than a 4-pin XLR.<br/>(3) Usability - The BT model is really convenient, and I must say I feel hesitant to return it, however I think I would take the cost savings on the K361 and the convivence of the smaller cable connector. If you're shopping for the wireless option between the K371 and K361, go for the K361 or save for a higher end BT headphone. For the wired, I must say I am enjoying the K371 and see no need to try the K361, which is a bit cheaper. Other notes on BT--the range is great and I can walk 50ft to the breakroom or bathroom from my desk at work and still have good connection. The touch controls are fine, not perfect, but I found them better than not having any. Sometimes it seemed like the BT connection would randomly degrade after listening for over an hour or so and when connected to Windows 10, but I didn't have that issue on Android.

Where do I even start with the AKG K371. When you listen to these, it's like everything disappears, leaving nothing between you and the music. It's arguably the best closed back headphone that you can easily drive with mobile devices, like cell phones. The only closed-backs (headphones that don't leak sound everywhere) that are a significant improvement start at around 900 dollars, and you can only get the most out of them with a bulky amp, which cost a few hundred. For most people, this is as good as you'll ever need. And once you consider the price of around 150 dollars, it's arguably the best overall.<br/><br/>Now the sound. Oh lord the sound. These are quite frankly, beyond words to describe. If you're going from crappy earbuds or even mid tier headphones like the ATH-M50, it feels like listening to your songs for the first time all over again. It feels like there's nothing between you and the music. As for the actual sound signature, it's one of the best tuned headphones period. The slight bump in the sub-bass adds a subtle but fun kick. The bass is impressively detailed and controlled. The mids are well balanced without being reduced into the shadow realm. And finally, the treble is detailed and fun but without being too bright. Overall, it's very detailed and the tuning is to die for. Soundstage is rather impressive, and although it's not quite the best in that regard, it's nonetheless great. Noise isolation is okay, not great but "good enough". Imaging (left-right differentiation) is very solid.<br/><br/>These headphones excel at pretty much whatever you throw at them. I listened to a mix of Pop, Hip-hop, classic rock, metal, classical, electronic, jazz, synth, you name it. It's not just a jack of all trades, it masters then all. Gaming with these is also pleasant. I played Minecraft and Team Fortress 2 with these, and you have a pretty easy time discerning the direction of in-game sounds.<br/><br/>Finally we get to the overall physical build of the headphones. This is where the only real flaws show up. Some people online reported QC issues, but they seem to be resolved at this point, and indeed my pair is fine. The top of the headband has some soft plastic imitating leather. This is actually a good thing, since it feels like it probably won't start flaking off in a few years. The inside of the headband is some sort of padded silicone material, which should make it real easy to clean. The headband adjustment mechanism is odd. It combines the function of adjusting the headband and letting the earcups rotate inward for storage. It's a little more loose that I'd like, making it hard to get an exact position while holding it, but it holds in place flawlessly once on your head. Fortunately, there's an easily accessible screw once you remove a soft pad on the inside of the pivot, so tightening the whole thing is no problem. the bottom part of this mechanism is made of metal. The earcups are hit and miss. They're comfy leather, but can have trouble sealing, especially with glasses. Furthermore, AKG does not seem to offer replacements on their website. I've found that Shure SRH1540 earpads function as a suitable replacement, albeit an expensive one. But I could not perceive any difference in sound between different earpads, other than an improved seal using the Shure earpads. The included accessories are nice, including the drawstring carrying bag. The cable is slightly microphonic (noise gets transmitted through the cable when you touch it), but you don't notice it at all with music. The cables themselves though (you get three, none with mic, just a 1m, 3m, and coiled cable, with a screw-on 3.5mm to 1/4in adapter. Having detachable cables is a very nice touch.<br/><br/>So despite all the minor issues with the build, you might wonder why I'm still rating it 5 stars. Well, it's because they just sound that good. I couldn't recommend these enough. And for 150 dollars, it's a no-brainer.

NOTE: I have since switched to the AKG K371 (non-BT variant) and they resolve nearly every issue I had with these.<br/><br/>These are an interesting set of cans. I'm just going to go straight into this analysis:<br/><br/>- These headphones have a surface material that scratches VERY easily<br/><br/>- they have an annoying mini XLR cable gratefully detachable, but it's 4 pinned, and very obscure to replace unlike the standard 3 pin mini xlr cable with the standard non BT K371. Additionally the cable itself is legitimately *very difficult to release via the button, and i have big guitar playing hands.<br/><br/>- The hinge system is down right ridiculously stupid. It's designed to be "portable" (but this is marketed as a professional grade studio headphone so why??), and because of that they've redesigned a way to attach the ear cups to the headband, and unfortunately it creates a bunch of issues inherent to the entire new K-line by AKG (361, 371, and both BT variants). What are those issues?<br/><br/>1. Well, there's a bunch of sound leak, because it applies excessive pressure on the top part of the cup and leaks on the bottom as a result.<br/><br/>2. The physical cups are on an adjustment bar that is very sensitive to readjustments and often doesn't ever stay in place properly. It's so stupid how bad this works because remember, theres a big sound leak issue which SUBsequently leaks all of the low frequencies. So the only solution alternatively is a pad switch, or to adjust the headphones in a way where the ear cups and headband angle can *kind* of compensate for this. BUT THAT DOESN'T WORK SO GREAT WHEN THE CUPS READJUST THEMSELVES BY BREATHING ON THEM. Let's not even get into how dysfunctional it is without this sound leak issue. Trying to reinvent the wheel in total failure.<br/><br/>3. The way the pressure is applied on the cup, it presses excessive force above the top of the ear, which happens to be where a small pressure point on the head is. So the result is a headphone clamp that causes mild headaches upon use. I believe as you use these, this clamp force is reduced as mentioned on headfi.org, but then I would imagine this effects the seal from the cups themselves, thus resulting in more sound leak.<br/><br/>So these ups are just one big negative feedback.<br/><br/>To add insult to injury, AKG designed the ear cups differently between k371 and the k371bt. The k371's are recessed differently, and as a result, the newer BT variant I'm reviewing are very, very close to the ears due to different and thinner pads. As a matter of fact, for me, with a regular shaped head and sized ears, MY EARS REST AGAINST THE DRIVER of the headphones. This is so unacceptable at this price point and for a "Professional Studio Headphone". I can't mix for more than an hour without severe ache and irritation from my ears because of this. They agitate unrelentingly, and this is the main reason I've decided to return them.<br/><br/>The sound is okay.<br/>I myself enjoy the roundness of the low end, albeit a little bloated.<br/><br/>The Bluetooth:<br/><br/>-Can only connect to one device at a time.<br/><br/>-limited Codec options make for commercial grade sound, but below average for audiophiles or "Professional Studio" use. I'm assuming this feature isn't intended for professional usecases.<br/><br/>- The range I apparently VERY good! Which is a great surprise. There supposedly supposed to be about as good as Apple Air Pods, and better than just about every thing else tried by another user I've spoken with.<br/><br/>- Controls are comically bad. They're touch, and I’d say anywhere between 15% and 20% of the time I can get it to work (.e. play, pause, etc). Volume control is as bad, if not worse for me. Closer to 10% of the time I'd say, without exaggeration.<br/><br/>Finally, to touch on pad swap. I swapped to the perforated “slanted” pad made by BRAINWAVZ and while I didn’t mind the original sound signature in it’s lows, this pad swap has created a much more balanced sound in the lows, while also making the signature much more interesting in the upper mids and treble. They add a little bit of pleasing air, scoop out some of the excessive fattiness in the sup bass, making it more shapely overall, while also, and to my great appreciation, reduce some of the abrasive mids that can come off “shouty” in the original pad response. Finally, something that is definitely worth noting and praising that you did not mention, is that the perforated pads create a SIGNIFICANT breathe-ability in the ear cup with the cans on which is not only adding to the “airiness” on top, in the treble register, but also helping tremendously with long recording sessions. Before, the stock pads would not only kill the ears with achiness and irritability, they would get VERY sweaty and hot in reasonable 1.5+ hour recording sessions. These new BRAINWAVZ perforated pads for the ATX line are substantially more breathable, which would seem obvious, but I didn’t expect it to be this much better. Humidity never really exceeds 60% of what the original pads did after an hour and a half. And that is a huge difference. Also, on the subject of these pads and the “on-ear” fit. They do fit kinda half on ear half off, because there is an inward slant that goes towards the inside of the cup. Now, I myself am sensitive to this idea, but for some reason it doesn’t feel noticeable uncomfortable or agitating. I don’t really know why that is but I’m very grateful.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>I like the sound, the fact that the cable is detachable, and the Bluetooth sound is actually pretty darn good compared to others. But, too many other issues. Sure, with the extra pads, 3, or even 3.5 would be reasonable IMHO. But with the number of fundamental issues like the stupid hinge design (Why are they adding “portability” design to a studio headphone FFS?), and thus, awful sound leak, as well as very poor Bluetooth controls, the strange clamp force headache, and very poor ear cup design... These design flaws are so fundamental, that they’re inexcusable to me as a consumer And bear in mind my body dimensions are very average. Perhaps on the slimmer athletic side with normal head size and ear size. Not to sound harsh, but the issues are so  basic that they deserve to be highly criticized IMO.<br/><br/>My final score would be 2-2.5 stars.

I bought the k361-bt versions, and I will stand by these headphones having an incredibly good sound. While they don't come with ANC and have a proprietary cable, the benefits of the sound alone are worth the money.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, after about 2 months of use, the right ear cup suddenly gave out. I have been very careful with these headphones and generally place them gently because of the way it folds. But just today, as I decided to plug them into my laptop just for general use, no sound was coming out of the right ear. I'm afraid I believe it might be one of the wires being loose, as even in wireless mode it still has no sound coming out of the right cup.<br/><br/>I still stand by it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a mid range priced pair of cans. Unfortunately I won't be able to appreciate them for a while now. I am absolutely devastated because these have beeny favorite pairs to go to for the past couple months.

I was never a fan of headphones until I bought this one. Because I needed to meditate using binaural beat audio files, I bought another so called "professional" headphone 3 years ago for $50. Although its bass is good enough for the low frequency in my audio files, I was never satisfied with its other respects of the sound quality. Then my old headphone broke so I needed to buy a replacement. I made the decision to buy AKG 371 based on its range of frequency response and its price.<br/><br/>I never used any other headphones with sound quality better than audiophile class speakers until this one. I have a stereo speaker/amplifier system worth $600. Now if I make the speaker volume low, I should say the sound quality from my 371 headphone is better than sound from my speaker system. The speaker sound quality is better than the sound from 371 headphone only if I make the speaker system volume loud.<br/><br/>The sound from the headphone is clear and rich, with all the frequency components from music. The bass is rich but not heavy and the treble is full of clarity. I am very satisfied with this headphone! Although the build quality for this headphone is not the top class, I cannot expect much for a headphone at a price lower than $200.<br/><br/>Something to note for beginner audiophile listeners:<br/><br/>1. You need a good quality DAC (digital analog converter) to fully realize the headphone's potential. Both my computer and my cellphone have HD DACs so they are good enough for me. You don't need to buy this headphone if you only have a very low end cellphone.<br/><br/>2. Also you need at least high data rate MP3 files to really enjoy the rich details of the music. Probably you need at least 192kbps MP3 files. You don't need this headphone for 128kbps MP3 files.

I got these in June 2021. Was surprised that they sounded so bright given that they have a reputation for being dark sounding but I didn't mind. I listen to mostly metal and rock, stuff with instruments and these were fantastic. Unfortunately the pads fell apart in about 8 months. I replaced them with Shure HPAEC1540 pads (a bit pricey but worth it. They don't change the sound much and are more comfy than stock pads). I was happy with this setup until the right side driver just up and died on me at the end of July 2022. I used them heavily (6 hours daily on average) but am very careful and took care of them as best as I could. I didn't get any shorting or anything before it happened. Just unplugged for the night, tried in the morning and nothing. Even opened it up to check for issues with the cabling and everything seemed normal. The driver was dead. I was very disappointed. Loved these things up to that point. So yea, great sound but they may die on you.<br/><br/>I've since replaced them with Beyerdynamic DT 700 Pros and am happy again as the sound signature is similar but with improvements in the bass regions. The build quality on these and Beyer's reputation also inspire confidence in their durability.

Great value for travel.

One sentence review: Give them a chance to break in.<br/>These are my favorite "walking around" headphones.  They're comfortable (still a bit sweaty in hot weather), and durable.<br/>Sound is pretty good (still not as good at my AKG k702's, but I can't walk around with the K702's, as they're open back.)<br/>Would I buy them again? Yeah.  Probably.<br/>They're closed backed, so the sound-stage is small.  I realize I've gotten spoiled on my open back, huge sound-stage, headphones.<br/>They don't draw a lot of power, so you can use them with your cell-phones to play music (No mic. Remember that), without a need for an amp.<br/>All in all they're pretty good. Still a tiny bit of muddiness in the lower ranges, but like I said, I've been spoiled on my open-back headphones.<br/>Old review.<br/>I've been using AKG products for the last 20 years.  I just got the K371's today, and while they are comfortable, and they seem sturdy, I've noticed a lot of muddiness across a broad range of sound.  Especially the lower range. Maybe it's because they're closed backed (My AKG K702's sound WAY better), or maybe they need a break-in period.  But this isn't just flat sound.  It sounds like  I'm listening to them though a wad of tissue paper in the ear-cups.<br/>Will update in a few days, but if they don't improve, I'm going to have to send them back.<br/>Update:  A few days later, and sound has improved slightly, it's still a very "In your head sound". There's still some muddiness, but seems to be slowly getting better.  Sound stage is small. This is not some subjective thing.  Literally, some notes do not come across clearly.  These are good headphones, but unlike some of the other reviewers claim, these are NOT audiophile headphones.  I wouldn't even say they're good for reference. They're good walking around headphones, and are very comfortable (save for the ear sweat caused by the pleather ear-cups). For a comparison, the  AKG K702 is an audiophile headphone, and I can hear notes in that I cannot hear with these headphones. I've listened to the Grado's and those sound great as well (I'm going to buy a pair of those when I get the money), but those two headphones are open back, and no good for walking around.<br/>Buy the K371's if you want decent (and I mean DECENT.) headphones, that are sturdy.  They come with three cables, some of which are worth $40.00 alone.  So the three cables have to be worth at least $75.00 if you bought them by themselves. A short, straight cable.  A long straight cable, and a coiled cable (which is great).  You can use them in standard 3.5 and 1/4 plugs.<br/>Am I disappointed?  Yes.  But they're not horrible. The sound isolation and extra cables make the purchase a decent value.  Build quality is great, though.  Save for those ear-cups. Pleather on closed backed headphones?  Really?

So far the K361 are my favorite headphones.<br/>I used them every day at my computer since July, 2021.<br/>They broke on me twice but customer care has been fantastic so far.<br/>The first time the wire became frayed and eventually failed after around 6 months of use.<br/>I called support and they sent me a new cord for free because it was under warranty.<br/>Around the 11 month mark the plastic on the ears started to wear off and eventually the foam ear fell off making them unusable.<br/>I sent them in for repair and I'm still waiting for them to be returned.<br/>The support team has been in contact with me and is sending me a new set.<br/>I will update when the replacement arrives but the customer service I have received so far has convinced me that the new headphones are going to be great.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend the K361.<br/>Comfortable, great sound, folds easily, the only downside is that the 3.5mm cable is not interchangeable, it has a special plastic clip that keeps it in the phone so you can't just use any 3.5mm cable if it frays.<br/>Have to buy the special one only they sell.

Wow, just wow. TLDR right up front, these are fantastic headphones for the price. If you have any hesitation to buy them whatsoever, let me tell you that you won't be disappointed. Bass is a bit lower than some people would like, but hey they're open backs!<br/><br/>My pair arrived in their retail box, which was kind of surprising as the box wasn't even sealed. Thankfully the headphones were undamaged and they appear to be brand new, although I honestly wouldn't care if they were used since they look fine.<br/><br/>Included I was surprised to find a 1/4 inch (the big audio connector for amps and such) to 3.5mm adapter pre-installed on the unit. I was actually kind of worried that I accidentally purchased the wrong variant of these headphones, since the adapter looked like it was part of the cable. Thankfully my initial assumption was incorrect, and the adapter unscrewed revealing a 3.5 mm plug, although I must say the quality of this adapter is what fooled me. It's super nice and fits on the cable seamlessly!<br/><br/>The fabric the removable ear pads are made out of is kind of strange, it's almost like a felt material but it doesn't have the same shininess to it. Nevertheless it is very comfortable for the price, and in general comfort of these headphones is quite good. The self-adjusting headband and whatnot is a straight-up clone of the AKG K240s, which certainly isn't a bad thing in this case. Samson have done a fantastic job replicating the design of the K240s while also managing to keep costs low. The non-removable cable is a bit of a downside, but the included cable is very high quality and quite long. Seriously I've never seen gold-plated connectors that look and feel this good. As an Australian drummer once said "they're are symphony of plastic, but AvE has taught me that not all plastics are created equal". That statement is definitely true here, as the plastic that Samson has used for the SR850s is definitely on the higher quality side. The headband is fake leather and the supports that house the audio cable for the other driver are made of metal (maybe aluminum?).<br/><br/>Now, onto sound quality. Honestly when I had seen and heard all of the great reviews on these headphones I was expecting them to be quite amazing. Maybe it's not as dramatic as I expected, but these are my first pair of legitimately good budget headphones. The "sound stage" or 3D feel of the sound is definitely there, and while playing video games with gunfire or engines you can definitely feel the openness of the semi open back design. I particularly enjoy running around in Skyrim SE with them.<br/><br/>I will say the bass isn't crazy heavy, but looking at the frequency response graph for these headphones they're actually somewhat more bassy than more of the higher end true open back headphones. This is fine for me though, I do like base but I understand the concessions that had to be made for these headphones to have such good soundstage. That's always been the trade-off for open backs, less bass and also way less noise isolation. And on that note, yeah they definitely don't block anywhere near as much noise as a set of earmuffs would, but I actually like that since I need to be able to hear things while I'm using my computer or listening to music on my iPod. As always with audio, it's very subjective and you may find that these are the best headphones ever for you, or you may hate them because they're not crazy bassy like most everything else made nowadays. (Looking at you Beats and Raycons!) I can't really find any other descriptive words to describe the mids or highs, because I'm really just a novice when it comes to audio. Maybe just... they're great!<br/><br/>As far as durability goes I've only had them for a few days so I can't say much as to how I think they'll stand up over the long term. I will say that the non-removable cable is definitely once again a downside as far as durability goes, but if you're really invested in keeping your SR850s alive and you're handy with a soldering iron I see no reason why you couldn't add an aux connector connector. The headband and metal supports seem quite sturdy given the price, and I expect these to last for years to come. By then I'll likely have something better, but honestly if you're just into them for the looks, for content creators or streamers they look really cool and professional. I think if these things ever have some sort of catastrophic failure I'll either buy a new pair or attempt to fix these myself, as the design seems fairly simple.<br/><br/>The ear cups are removable and seem to be fairly modular. I'm sure there are several replacements on various websites, and if you're handy with sewing scissors and a needle and thread you could probably even make your own if you were so inclined. I think some gel ear pads would be super cool to try with these, although I don't know if these headphones have enough of a cult following for some manufacturer to take on that challenge.<br/><br/>Maybe if I'm feeling brave enough one day I will take apart the ear cup and speaker assembly to see how repairable they are from the inside, but for now I'm just happy to have a very good sounding set of headphones for my PC and iPod.<br/><br/>9/10, definitely five stars but a non-removable cable is probably the only downside. You'll know these aren't crazy bassy if you're in the market for open backs so that's not a downside in my opinion.

Not really sure how I can go into an in-depth review of headphones, but I am not sure anything I can say, can do these Samson's justice.  I will just do a quick (after a few days) "first impressions" review for these.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>  - Sound Quality: These headphones SOUND AMAZING ... granted I have never had higher end headphones myself but I am a fan of "clean" sound ... not overly basey (though that can be fun at times) or too much treble, that can sound "tinny" that way.<br/><br/>  These sound perfect, and I love the mids in these (I am OVERsimplifying this but say most of the instruments and vocals of a typical rock song), versus some of my bluetooth headphones where sometimes it sounds muddy or the vocalist (example) is in another room vs the rest of the band playing the music.<br/><br/>  I have randomly gone through my collection and listened to Jazz, Rap, Rock, and more ... and these sound great across the board.  Some headphones tuned for base ... they can sound ok but with some genres like Smooth Jazz ... it doesn't sound right having an emphasis on base.  These just sound so clear, with maybe one issue for some people (depending on personal taste and genre ... It's my first "con" listed below, and it's the base ...mainly for those people that love alot of extra base... i have to make that part CLEAR).<br/><br/>  I know some of my cheaper headphones people may laugh at ... say the Sony ZX100's or ZX110's may not have as great of a sound of these Samson's but one thing I love about the Samson's is that they dont "ruin" the other headphones I have ... like "these are so so great that anything else sounds bad now" ... these sound better but i am still happy with some of those other headphones too. I was sort of afraid that may happen, but glad it didn't.<br/><br/>  - The earpad/overall comfort: I cant say any headphones I have had are UNcomfortable, mind you, but these which are not the ones with the "Pleather" (like fake leather) earpads that I see some SR850 reviews posting that they came with.  The SR850s that I got, have velour earpads that may not be as good as the Bravewavs ones I see people replace these with but ... I was expecting these to be "harder" and less comfortable then they are ...<br/><br/>  I may check out those BrainWavs pads, and maybe even buy a pair to have "on hand", but these default pads do NOT need to be changed ... they are great the way they are.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>  - Sound (base ... if you are a "base-head"): just have to mention that if you are a "base head" needing extra base ... well these are not for you ... I'd RECOMMEND trying these to listen to your music as an extra pair ... but something like the SkullCandy Cruzher like series or The SoundCore series may be more of what you want. These are a good option if you have a more base heavy pair of headphones and you want to hear what all the bragging about these headphones are all about ... maybe for like rap you use those other headphones for jazz or soul music you use these ... in other wards "give these a try ... " sort of thing ... the BASE IS "there" but just not like some of my say Bluetooth headphones ... the base is done in a "classy" way .. a "clean" way, in my view.<br/><br/>  I also know the GREAT sound in these can be thrown off if there was more base ... it can be a delicate balance and ... the base may be EXACTLY WHERE it should be to not mess up the rest of the balance of these headphones.<br/><br/>  - this I will put here ... but it's not so much a con as a "gee i wish they did this" sort of thing ... I wish the REALLY GOOD cable ... was removable/replaceable ... but then again if it's really that good, you will not need to replace it. The cable doesn't look or feel cheap in anyway, and I dont want people to get what I am saying confused ... I just "wish" that this cable was removable.  If something happens to it .. not counting people that may be able to solder something back on ... you would need to get another pair (which ... if my cable broke ... I 100% would get another pair of these SR850's .. they are worth it).<br/><br/>  -Appearance: I almost forgot this in the review.  I have seen a few videos on these headphones and i have seen thumbnails ... they always looked ok, but I was more interested in the sound ... I can't comment about how they look on my head, but just having them in my possession ... they really look pretty good .. not my favorite looking headphones mind-you but ... they look better than I was picturing when I ordered them.<br/><br/>  Bottom Line:<br/>  I dont think I have to say much here, as I obviously 100% recommend these, even to base-heads just as a "try these and listen to your favorite music, and hear the difference" sort of thing. I hear some people who do music professionally getting blown away with the sound and the price of these, together ... some say that reference headphones wise these have more base then others (say comparable AKG's)... but if you want that quality/type of sound .. with a pitch/bit of more base .. THESE ARE the ones to go with.  "if your just listening to your music and you want SUPER GOOD quality, but aren't doing studio audio type stuff you need a true pair of reference headphones... these are the ones to get" .

Absolutely incredible headphone for the price. My pair lasted me a very very long time especially considering all the abuse I put them through. I was really rough on these things, I dropped them all the time, and I threw them when I got angry and stuff like that. The right ear driver went out after probably 100 or so drops on the ground. These were very hard drops on the ground too, and even then only the right driver went out, every other part of the headphone remained unharmed. The sound quality on these are incredible, especially for the price. These were my first open back headphones and they were a great introduction. These feel weird on your head at first due to the padding but when you get used to it they have a very good comfort level. With the recent price cut they got, I can 100% recommend these to anyone. They sound incredible, are extremely durable, they run out of anything, are comfortable when you get used to them, and are 100% the best headphone you can buy in its price range, even when it was $50.

Honestly, these sound better than my sony xm4's (even used an equalizer), and the sound quality to price ratio is absurd. I've had many headphones in the past, most more expensive than these that don't even compare in sound quality, I wish I had gotten these sooner. I have a larger head than average, and these just barely fit, I can still feel a bit of pressure from the headband but otherwise its fine.

The sound is amazing for the price, don’t get me wrong, but the cable broke after a few months of light use. One of the parts of the stress reliever on the top of the cable broke and just recently I noticed the cable itself broke in the same place revealing the wires on the inside. This has caused some problems like sound only coming out of one ear. The 3.5mm to 1/4 in adapter is also defective in my case, it only plays sound through one ear. How do I know this isn’t just the fault of the faulty cable? It also does this to my Beyerdynamic DT770 and my apple EarPods. If you do want these I’d recommend spending the extra few bucks and buying some AKG K240’s. They are of similar design (because these are a clone of the K240’s) and similar sound quality but better build quality, even with the modern ones made in china.<br/><br/>In summary, these kinda suck and you’d be better off getting K240’s or getting these and soldering a better cable on/soldering a connector on like mmcx or mini xlr so you can put your own cables on these
----
First off, these are incredibly comfortable. You can wear these for hours because they are self-adjusting and the cups themselves feel really soft for the price point.<br/>Second, I hear a lot of complaints about the headphones either not being balanced enough or bassy enough. These are not meant for that. Every headphone sounds different just like every movie is about something different. You can get an expressive nat geo documentary from the hd 600’s or sharknado from your raycons on both extremes. These are more like a “based on true events” movie. They sound pretty balanced but have a bit of a “v sound” to make it more appealing for mainstream listeners.<br/>Overall, these are great for beginners who want their first pair of at home headphones. For the price you cant beat it.

I picked them up off a recommendation from a certain youtuber, and yeah they are absolutely bomb. I had a pair of Beyerdynamic DT880s (600 Ohm) and the right driver broke on me from my own fault (dropped it on accident) so I started to look into some replacements that might not be as expensive. Enter, the second best headphones that I have ever personally owned. I've seen it all from the cheapest Onikuma gaming headsets where sound doesn't come through both cans all the time, to ludacris souls that would shake your soul from how much bass they had, and multiple pairs of AKGs before and after the takeover happened.<br/><br/>I have to say, these are incredible, no they are not perfect reference headphones but for $35 I don't think you're finding any that sound incredible and are durable through the test of time. Mine definitely have some cosmetic wear on them, but can confirm that the sound has not taken any damage over the course of my tenure with them. Now I don't know why amazon is asking me to rate the noise cancellation and the bass, as these are open backs so for people who know, they know. If you don't know, about 5 minutes of research will get you caught up.
----
Got these as a temporary replacement until I got around to fixing my grados (yes I watch dankpods, how could you tell), and I think I actually like these better now. Of course being open-backs noise leaks in quite a lot, but the sound quality is really good and they feel built pretty well. I've thrown them across the room onto my bed multiple times and they've held up through all of it.
----
These are amazing right now as is. Especially for the price, if you're looking for headphones for your desktop get these. And as the title says they're not bassy, but they can be.<br/><br/>What you'll want to do is get these and then get some thick earpads for them. I got these:<br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089F5BFG5?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/><br/>keep reading if you need more convincing<br/><br/>I'm listening to them right now and their bass is astounding now. super clean and not muddy at all. I swear I can hear the fabric of the bass pedal. It's bassy when they need to be too, not every song is head shaking but when the artist wants it to be, these headphones show it. The highs are crisp as well, I'm more sensitive to high ranges because they sting a bit. but with the earpads, it's not bothering me at all.
----
Wow, it’s still ridiculous that these are only $34.<br/><br/>Granted, the build quality in hand does feel more like a $34 pair of headphones, but man once you put them on and listen I was really surprised with just how good these sound.<br/><br/>Seriously, for the price you cannot go wrong with giving these a go, especially if you just need a decent pair of headphones or you are looking to try an open back headphone design.<br/><br/>Only thing that would make these a 5 star in my book is if the headphones themselves had a removable 3.5 Aux wire so I could swap in a shorter/longer wire when desired!

A disclaimer: I received this product as part of Amazon’s Vine program.  While I didn’t pay for the item, the review is totally my personal, unbiased review.  Neither Amazon, nor the vendor has influenced this review in any way.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Excellent noise cancelling<br/>Very good sound quality for all Bluetooth profiles (Listening to music, phone/video calls)<br/>Battery life<br/>Excellent Bluetooth range<br/>Automatic voice detection to pause music and enter transparency mode<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Touch controls are simply awful!<br/>Dual Bluetooth device support<br/>Constant beeps and noise cancelling turned off especially with “Detection of Actions” enabled<br/>Voice detection for stopping music and going into a transparency mode responds to almost any sound you make.  A large breath, grunt, anything will trigger this feature.<br/>Rubs on the “helix” outer part of the ear on the left ear<br/>Somewhat complex set up process<br/><br/>Overall these are really excellent Bluetooth headphones.  The noise cancellation is absolutely excellent.  This is probably the best noise-cancelling headphone available.  The Bluetooth range is also exceptional.  Audio quality for music is also very good, and I expect most people will find them to be excellent. Phone/video call audio is also good receiving, and acceptable for the microphone.  They have long battery life and charge quickly.  They are relatively comfortable as well. The touch user controls are simply dreadful.  There are many other features with a range of benefit.<br/><br/>Comfort:<br/>They seem comfortable, and the ear pads are soft and plush.  However after several hours the outside of my ears start to hurt from rubbing on the insides of the headphones (the area called helix on top of the ear rubs on the inside of the left ear around optical sensor area.)  If at sometime we resume taking long international flights this could be an even larger issue.<br/><br/>They are still comfortable though when wearing them with glasses.  They ear pads are pliant enough to continue to make a good seal without painfully pushing them into your head.<br/><br/>Bluetooth, Pairing, Multiple devices:<br/>These support 2 Bluetooth devices to be connected simultaneously.  The Bose QC35 has had this feature for some time.  I initially paired my iPhone X with the headphones.  I then added a MacBook Pro from within the Connect app.  I was then able to play music from the MacBook.  I went back to the iPhone and tried to play something.  It didn’t immediately play. In fact, it is rather finicky.  Sometimes starting something with audio on the iPhone will cause audio to switch.  Mostly it doesn’t if something is playing already on one device.  Stopping the audio, waiting, and then starting the audio on the phone is a bit more reliable. Even if the source on one device is paused and not playing it may not switch back.<br/>This is a bit problematic though since the iPhone still thinks it is connected to a Bluetooth headphone, so the audio is still routed to the Sony WH-1000MX4, but isn’t played – so it goes no where.  This works far more seamlessly on the Bose QC35.  I actually found myself disabling this feature half the time.<br/><br/>While the WH-1000MX4 does have voice announcements, it doesn’t speak the name of the device.  It will say “Bluetooth device 1 connected,” whereas the Bose QC35 will speak “Joe’s iPhone.” Even more confusing is that device 1 and device 2 doesn’t always refer to the same device.  Sometimes my iPhone is device 1 and other times it is device 2.  The only way to really know is to go into the app where it will identify the device associated with device 1 and device 2.<br/><br/>I added a 3rd Bluetooth device, again from the app.  This works, but will disconnect one of the 2 already connected devices.  It works pretty much like most Bluetooth devices.  You disconnect at least one of the currently connected devices and then connect the new device.  You can have multiple devices paired, but a maximum of 2 devices currently connected.  You can see the list of devices within the Connect app.<br/><br/>Bluetooth range is excellent.  It would easily stay connected when going from one area of a reasonably large house to another.  The range exceeds any other Bluetooth headphones.<br/><br/>Sound Quality:<br/>Sound quality has to be the most subjective area to evaluate, yet one of the most important. Most people will find these really very good to excellent.  For most these may well be the best sounding headphones they have ever had. Those more critical may find a few areas where they lack, but still they are excellent for noise cancelling headphones.  Sound quality is probably one of the best aspects of these headphones.<br/>The sound quality when listening to high quality content was very enjoyable.  Overall they are fairly well balanced, albeit a bit heavy on the low end, but not boomy or with obvious peaks in the response.  More so they sound “warm.” The bass is noticeable, and quite deep.  You will clearly hear the thump of a drum, but still somewhat tight.  The deep bass on some of the Billie Eilish tracks is impressive. The bass is not so excessive though that it drowns out mid or high frequencies.  Music sounds good with individual instruments clearly identified.  Male and female vocals sound good and natural.<br/>The deep warm bass works well for movies and similar entertainment.  These will likely work quite well for watching airplane entertainment.  High frequencies are clear, and more smooth than harsh. They are balanced overall with a bit more low frequency emphasis that shifts the balance a bit.<br/>The iPhone app does have equalization settings, so it is possible to adjust to your personal preferences.  I reviewed these set at flat, default setting.<br/><br/>If one is going to compare these to audiophile headphones they will clearly notice differences. They will not replace examples of the best open or closed back audiophile headphones.  They simply lack the detail, imaging and placement that those headphones present when paired with a quality DAC and headphone amplifier.  That really isn’t a fair comparison though as these are noise cancelling Bluetooth headphones and they do a great job at that.<br/><br/>I did listen through both Bluetooth with the AAC codec and wired with a quality external DAC while listening to high resolution content streamed from Tidal through a Master Quality Authenticated DAC. They do sound better with the same content played through a wired DAC than Bluetooth.  The difference wasn’t as much was expected. Sony did a good job with Bluetooth.  I also tried listening to them with the power off, as plain wired headphones.  They didn’t sound that different, which is rather a good thing.  The same experiment with Bose QC35s will have a totally different sound.  Bose relies extensively on equalization to get their otherwise somewhat poor sounding headphones to sound good.  Sony starts out with decent sounding drivers.<br/><br/>I have not tried using the LDAC hi-resolution Bluetooth codec yet.  This isn’t as easy as it would seem to use on either iOS or MacOS.  You can’t simply use a high-resolution source to use it.  You need to download and install the Sony Music Center app, then load the high-resolution content into that app to play.  I’m not sure how to get it to work with a Mac at all. The better codec should sound better.  To be fair, at least part of the problem is Apple in this case.<br/><br/>I did try the DSEE Extreme feature.  This supposedly improves the sound quality of low bit rate compressed content.  I listened to some low bit rate MP3 files, and some standard streaming services, such as Amazon Prime music.  It sounded different, I’m not sure I would say it sounded better.  At least what I noticed was a boost in high frequencies.  It made some of the squashed high frequency details more noticeable, but they still sounded highly compressed, and to some extent the compression artifacts became more noticeable.  This may well be a personal choice, and likely varies over content, level of compression, and codecs used.  The bottom line is that you really need to start with quality content.<br/><br/>The 360 Reality Audio was a disappointment. I tried playing a variety of tracks in 360 Reality Audio on Tidal.  I did this using the Tidal app on both iPhone and a Mac. I did link the Tidal app with the Sony app as part of the initial setup.  I did notice a wider sound stage. It wasn’t like demos in a movie theater for Dolby Atmos or anything that dramatic.  There was some front/rear placement depth.  It was interesting to play with for a while.  What I found though is that it just sounded strange.  I played some of the same tracks on Tidal HiFi or MQA and to me they sounded much better, much more musical.  Call me a purist, audiophile, or whatever, but I found the highly processed audio more annoying than enjoyable.  It doesn’t replace the stereo imaging or placement that superb headphones can present as described above.  Honestly overall these sound good enough without these audio tricks.  Perhaps if there were some movie encoded with 360 Audio it would be better to enjoy special effects and less about musicality. It seems more of a gimmick than musical.  By far the best quality was the same song in Master Quality on Tidal with an external DAC and the 3.5mm wired cable.<br/><br/>Phone calls<br/>The audio quality on phone and video calls has been excellent on the receiving side and is about as good as Bluetooth HFP profile gets. it is excellent for conversations.  With the excellent noise cancellation these are excellent for long video calls.  They will likely continue to be great for those forced to endure a noisy open office environment, or need to make phone calls in a noisy area such as an airport or train station.<br/>Phone call microphone:<br/>Overall I’ve had only a few complaints from those that I’ve in meetings or on calls with.  Most people said I sounded fine.  I was on one phone call with my iPhone and the person had difficulty understanding me and could hear me fine when I switched to the iPhone.  They said I sounded “far away.”  On a video call I had some people refer to the sound as “bubbly.” After switching to AirPod Pros and the sound improved.<br/>They seem to isolate ambient noise reasonably well, although I haven’t had extreme cases to try during working from home due to COVID-19.  This is one area where Bose QC35 were awful. I don’t know if they match AirPod Pro for microphone beam forming, but so far they seem fine. These work for phone and video calls, but aren’t great.<br/><br/>Noise cancellation<br/>These are fantastic at noise cancellation.  I haven’t been on an airplane with them, the real test, but these seem significantly better than the already excellent Bose QC35.  At least around the house they block out the low frequency sounds that noise-cancelling headphones are best at. Around the house even a Ninja blender was mostly attenuated while I was on a conference call.  My neighbor’s air conditioner that still can be heard with the Bose QC35 and AirPod Pros is completely gone with these.  I was even using a really loud flooring saw and used these.  I did still hear the saw, but not very loud, and I could still enjoy music while sawing flooring!  Family talking is mostly gone during conference calls and entirely when playing music.  I expect that these would be great in an open office environment or an airplane.  Bose QC35 were the best I had used prior to these, and the Bose don’t work nearly as well, especially for voice.  They have much better noise cancellation than Apple Air Pod Pro buds too. If your main reason for looking for headphones is noise cancellation, these are what you buy.<br/><br/>One annoyance I had with the Bose QC35 headphones is if I wore glasses the sidepieces would create an acoustic leak and let some noise in. They still work, but especially on an airplane you would hear more air noise. I haven’t tried them on an airplane yet due to covid, but so far I don’t notice nearly as much difference as I did with the Bose with glasses.<br/><br/>Battery:<br/>Sony claims 20 hours of battery life without defining what mode. Other headphones sometimes have decreased battery life with HFP (phone calls).  These definitely exceed the rated battery life.  With the first charge they lasted almost a week of varied use.  I used them for a multi-day virtual conference, and other meetings (combination of HFP and A2DP) for over 14 hours, and they still had 60% charge.  Sony doesn’t specify any longer battery life with the wired cable.  On the Bose I would plug the cable in when I would go to sleep on international flights, and Bose quoted 40 hours like that, so 20 hours isn’t fantastic.  It is more than enough though.  It will get you through the longest flight plus some other use.  Almost any other use it should be more than enough.  I used them over 10 hours straight one day and they were still around 70% charged.<br/><br/>Charging:<br/>These charge with a USB-C connector.  They come with a very short (about 6”) USB-A to C cable but no power supply.  They charge relatively quickly (less than an hour from 20%, but I didn’t time it).  You will need around a 10W power supply to get the fastest charging.  I monitored the charge current from 20% capacity.  They started at 0.44A or roughly 2.2W, which seemed reasonable for headphones. Then they jumped to 1.32A or about 6.66W, then to the maximum I saw was 1.8A or about 9 W! It is surprising that Sony pushed that much power into a headphone! The actually battery capacity has to be pretty large, so it apparently does use quite a bit of power.  In most cases this is of no issue, they charge up quick.  It can be an issue is if you are stuck trying to charge them in an airport or airplane port. They will also suck a lot out of a battery pack.<br/><br/>User interface:<br/>This is the worst aspect of these headphones.  The touch controls are simply dreadful, almost unusable.  Simple buttons would have been much better.  Even with practice it is almost impossible to master the gestures to go forward, backward, start/stop, and change the volume. Either it doesn’t register the touch, or it does the wrong thing.  You try and turn the volume down and track changes.  To be fair, they do have a volume control.  The Air Pods Pro don’t and that is really annoying. Even with practice controls don’t work right.<br/>Some guidance: to change the volume, especially lower it, swipe down on the right ear as if you are petting it. Just swiping as if using a smartphone touch screen won’t work right.  Swipe down from above the top just like petting it, and then it might change the volume.  Changing tracks is even harder, and only seems to happen when trying to change the volume.  Hitting the start stop button doesn’t seem to work, except of course when you try to adjust the headphone on your head and then it stops what you were listening to, and would likely hang up a call – be careful of that.  I end up using controls on my phone or computer most times.  Simple buttons would have been SO much better.<br/><br/>Voice assistant:<br/>Setting up Alexa is not all that easy. Assuming the headphones are already set for Alexa, you already have the Alexa app installed and set up, and the headphones are already paired to the phone you still need to add the WH1000MX4 to Alexa. This takes going to the Alexa app, and adding the device.  It will then want to pair with Bluetooth.  I put the WH1000MX4 into pairing mode by using the almost hidden mode of holding the power button (rather than the app). It then showed it failed to connect, but it actually seemed to pair on the second attempt.  If you were successful you will have a second pairing of the device as LE_-WH1000XM4, for a second Bluetooth Low Energy pairing.<br/><br/>Then Alexa did work hands free (if enabled in the Alexa app).  You could just say Alexa and it worked.  You could ask Alexa what ever you normally would.  It seemed to actually work better than the Echo Auto that also relies on the app.  The response audio always has the first syllable of cut off though.  This works fine for querying Alexa, or invoking Alexa content.  It does NOT work for controlling other functions on the phone, even changing the volume.  Telling Alexa to play won’t resume what was playing on the phone, it will resume what the Alexa app used last it seems.  This may be iPhone limitations, but I will likely switch to Siri and see if that works better.  It would be great if you could have all of them and just invoke the desired one with the appropriate wake word (Alexa, Hey Siri, OK Google).  I haven’t tried other voice assistants with these yet.<br/><br/>The automatic speak to chat feature is both great and annoying.  At least with the sensitivity set to automatic it will detect voice quite well and stop the content you may be listening to, and allow ambient sound to be heard.  This, when desired is far more convenient than Air Pods Pro where you have to hold be button for a few seconds to go into transparency mode.  While you still can’t hear what someone says to you, at least when you reply to them, it immediately lets you hear them, and doesn’t take the seconds the Air Pods do. With AirPods you also need 2 actions to stop music and enter transparency mode.  This mostly works.  In the automatic mode it doesn’t need to actually be voice that triggers it.  Anything like a grunt, large breath, anything it seems will trigger it. The slightest grunt or sound and they stopped the music and went into ambient mode.  There is a low sensitivity mode that I haven’t tried yet.  You will find this feature to be a love/hate relationship after a while.  Even with the “Focus on Voice” feature enabled this still seems to be overly sensitive.<br/><br/>Another feature is adaptive sound control.  This is supposed to optimize the sound based on location, and detection of actions.  This is likely useful when changing between an office, train station, etc.  I haven’t evaluated that during a pandemic.<br/><br/>As for automatic detection of actions, that can be very annoying.  It was fine when sitting in one place. Initially I didn’t know why EVERY time I bent down the headphones would beep and go out of noise cancelling mode. Then resume playing normally. This is apparently the notification for detection of actions.  This can be disabled in the app.  If someone were to use these headphones in a gym or exercising this would be annoying as well.  (Note: These are NOT sport headphones!)<br/><br/> App<br/><br/>The app is essential to setting up, using, adjusting, and updating the headphones.  Sony even uses the app for pairing with the iPhone, which is unusual.  The app allows configuring the many options available, equalization and more.  You also use the app to optimize the headphones for the shape of your ears by taking a picture of your head and both ears.  I went through the whole process.<br/>There are a lot of options in the app, and the layout is OK.  It can be a bit confusing.<br/><br/>The app does provide a lot of control and information.  It shows battery level, and the current codec in use.  This last part I really like, Apple typically doesn’t show these details.  Many options can beyond simply being enabled or disabled from the app can also be further controlled.<br/><br/>Case, accessories<br/>A nice rigid fabric coated and lined travel case is provided. It is similar in size to the Bose QC35.  It appears that it would protect the headphones and hold up well with travel.<br/><br/>A 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable is included. This allows using the headphones with a wired source, such as an airplane entertainment system.  The cable does not have a microphone or controls and will not control and iPhone, iPad, or Mac or support calling.  It is only a 3-conductor plug for stereo listening.<br/><br/>While the Bose QC35 headphones come with an equivalent cable, the Bose QC25 cable, or the Amazon Basics alternative cable can be purchased that does allow using the QC35 for phone calls, and wired remote.<br/><br/>Also included is a short USB-A to USB-C charge cable, no charger, and the old 2-pin airplane adapter.

I left a lengthy review of the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. Since that review is out there, I'll reduce this one only to E285 and SX4.<br/><br/>Microphone and Playback<br/>The E285 was notably better than the SX4, as evidenced by my recordings while drumming. It’s neck and neck as far as clarity of voice goes.<br/><br/>Akin to the E285, the SX4 are quite good as far as pick-up goes. But unfortunately, they were a little too good (or simply worse at distinguishing background noise). A co-worker and I had a Zoom meeting with ourselves in the same closet (to maximize productivity), switching between the headsets. Whoever had the E285 could hear themselves through the headset. At first, I thought it was because of the function where you hear yourself through the headset. But alas, upon one of us leaving the room, the echo went away. This meant the SX4 was picking up the other’s voice! The main killer of the SX4 is that you have no way to mute yourself from the headset. As a pair of headphones to be used in the office, this is crucial. You never know when someone may decide to butt in your closet (or office, for most people) and shout “HHHHEEEYYYY!!”. In contrast, the E285 offers two ways to protect yourself from such intrusions – by raising the boom arm or by pressing the button on the boom arm, leaving you to look down simply in resignation at said co-worker without having disrupted the meeting. The one drawback with the E285 is that sometimes the first word or two don’t quite make it through, so you may develop a stutter of your introduction. “I’m Jason – oh – I’M JASON – oh you can hear me now? I’m Jason”. Good news is, you shan’t be soon forgotten. Despite this, it’s more favorable than not being able to mute myself, though I can understand disagreement with this point. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophile<br/>Both associated apps come with decent equalizers (unlike Bose). Honestly, it was difficult to tell the difference between the E285 and SX4. I think the amount of bass you get is comparable, however I think the SX4 is capable of producing an ever-so-slightly louder sound. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Brand<br/>Jabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice!<br/><br/>Sony: same as Jabra, though with a caveat. The SX4 offers more utility when given Location permission, which will be addressed later on. They were not pertinent to me, however, so my location remains an enigma for Sony and Jabra (and Bose). Tie between E285 and SX4.<br/><br/>ANC<br/>When playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. The E285 does a better job with impact noises (or maybe it’s just higher frequencies) than the other headsets, though the SX4 is perfectly satisfactory.<br/><br/>In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. It almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). The SX4 has essentially the same feature, with an added “Focus on voice” option. I couldn’t tell a difference when that was on/off. Besides that, the SX4 didn’t do as good a job at allowing sound through as the E285. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Connectivity<br/>The E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. Unfortunately, I don't remember specifics about the SX4. SX4 and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.<br/><br/>Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. The QC35II and SX4 are only Bluetooth, so you have to do the standard “add device”, etc. One annoying thing about the SX4 is you have to use the app to establish a Bluetooth connection to another device. Not a big deal, but for comparison’s sake, the E285 is better. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.<br/><br/>Response time: The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Again, the E285 feel lack-luster in comparison because they take approximately 4 M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-I seconds to pause, whereas the SX4 is half that time. For the E285, I’ve noticed the ear detection only works properly when playing music from your phone and not the PC. When using it with the PC, if I remove the headphones, the music will pause as it should. But it doesn’t resume when I put them back on. If I pause the music with the button, then remove the headset, it resumes. Again, cool feature, but needs work, especially when using it with the PC. So SX4 is better about ear detection (presumably because it's laser-assisted).<br/><br/>App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Winner is SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Voice Assistant<br/>The E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature (you can still press the action button with the boom arm up and have the assistant prompt, but because the arm is up, the microphone is off so it’s pointless). Tie between E285 and SX4.<br/><br/>Controls<br/>On the E285, the buttons take up little surface area and are rather flat. Muting is done with the E285 by simply raising or lowering the boom mic. In contrast, the SX4 doesn't have any way to mute yourself.<br/><br/>After just a little use of the “touchless” controls (B700 and SX4), I can see their usefulness. It’s certainly easier to play/pause music and use the Voice Assistant (which is no easier to actually setup because Bose sucks). Changing volume is annoying because every click up/down requires an extra swipe. As debilitating as this is, one would not likely be changing by a bunch of increments at a time. After more use of the touchless controls, I much prefer the them over the physical ones. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Comfort and Style<br/>Comfort is pretty much a tie between E285 and SX4. I've worn both for hours and hours without any issue. But I prefer the style of the SX4 - it just feels more premium. Winner is SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Extra<br/>The E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.<br/><br/>Issues<br/>There’s some variability with functionality of the Google Assistant with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.<br/><br/>Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars, same as the SX4. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. I can't say the same for the SX4 since it was ultimately returned. I ended up choosing the E285 over the SX4 because it has an edge when it comes to office use, for one main reason - you can't mute yourself on the SX4. But if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.

Because I do so many meetings over Teams (I'm a professional software trainer), I thought it would be time to finally invest in a really good headset. Up until now, I'd been using a $50 over-ear set by MPOW with a really nice boom mic. It was great, but it wasn't wireless, certainly wasn't portable, and didn't have the audio quality I'd want when listening to music.<br/><br/>I thought that by splurging more than $300 on a Sony product I'd get something that was beyond all of my expectations. I was almost right, but so very wrong in other ways.<br/><br/>CASE: Let's start here. The case is as slim as can be, very high-quality build, looks nice, feels nice, keeps everything protected. Excellent design here with one flaw: you can't really charge the headphones while they're snug in the case; they don't fold up the right way.<br/><br/>APP: To use most of the features, Sony requires you to download an app to your smartphone. That wasn't a big deal and the app was easy to figure out. It crashed twice on me (once during the first setup, again the next day). It offered some location-based services but I declined and it never asked me again. It wanted me to sign up for a free trial of some 360° music service -- not sure what that is, but I skipped it. I was disappointed that there wasn't a PC version of the app. For example, if I needed to switch which device the headphones were connected to, I can only do that from my phone -- that means my phone always has to be one of the two devices. There's no way to control the advanced features, or the equalizer, from the PC.<br/><br/>PAIRING: Bluetooth pairing was hit or miss, over and over again. If I were only pairing to my phone, I think it would be fine. But I wanted to also pair it to my desktop and laptop. The device supports pairing to two devices at the same time -- which was great -- but nearly every time I wanted to switch devices I had to literally turn off bluetooth so the headset would "let go". Other times, upon reconnecting, the mic wouldn't work. Once, which turned out to be the final straw for me, was when I could not get the headset to work in Teams no matter what I tried, even though it worked fine a few hours earlier. (For context: I literally train employees and other trainers on how to use Teams, so I very much know what I'm doing.)<br/><br/>SOUND QUALITY: Let me say that the sound quality IS exceptional. I had a blast listening to all my favorite songs streaming from my phone or laptop. I really can't understate the quality, base and treble. And the ANC (active noise cancelling) was AMAZING. I could be sitting right next to a whole house fan and not hear it. I was blown away.<br/><br/>RANGE: Twice during the day I tried walking around while on a call. It wasn't until I went downstairs that anyone said the quality of my voice had dropped. If I was less than 25 feet from the device, everything was great.<br/><br/>BATTERY LIFE: After a day of use it was down to about 50% and that impressed me. Then I watched TV and ate dinner and later that evening I put on the headphones and realized that the battery dropped to 10%. I thought the system had an auto-off feature but something didn't quite work.<br/><br/>CHARGING: So after my surprise drop in battery, I plugged it into my desktop with a USB C cable I already had. A little light on the headset turned red. When I woke up the next morning, I was surprised to learn that the headphones were still at 10%. Apparently the USB C cable I use to charge my mouse won't charge the headphones. I guess you need to use the cable it ships with? I'm not sure what the deal was here, but that was pretty annoying.<br/><br/>CONTROLS: I found the touch/gesture controls to be mostly intuitive. Pro Tip: If you swipe up and hold your finger, the volume slowly increments up. Once, however, I accidentally hung up a Teams call when I was trying to adjust the volume. I love the feature that let's me hear ambient sound by cupping my hear -- super cool. Tap the power button to hear the battery level -- very nice touch! However, there's one extremely important flaw in the controls that I was shocked to discover. THERE IS NO MUTE BUTTON. The ONLY way to mute your mic during a call (Teams, phone, Zoom, etc) is to use the mute button on the desktop/phone. The headset, whose very first bullet is "clear hands-free calling", has five built-in microphones, and a dedicated gesture to use Alexa... doesn't have a damn mute button. Sadly, the successor to this (the 1000XM5) has the same flaw.<br/><br/>Individually, the issues I raised wouldn't be enough for me to return the headset or give it a low rating. But for a $350 purchase, I expect it to be able to do what it says correctly. I expect a mute button. I expect it to power off when not in use. I expect any generic USB cable to work. I expect to be able to join a meeting without fussing with bluetooth.<br/><br/>I'd totally keep this if all I wanted it for was to listen to music.

UPDATE #2: After returning the first set of these headphones, I ordered another set on Prime Day and have now had a little more than a month to try them out.  Based on this experience so far, I'm raising the rating from 2 to 4 stars.  Trying not to jinx things, but the new unit does not have the right earcup static issue that plagued the first set (and that a not insignificant number of users have complained about).  I'm not sure whether one of the firmware updates addressed the issue or whether the first set had a hardware issue of some sort, but the new set has not had the issue.<br/><br/>I now believe the "bluetooth stopping for no reason" issue noted in my prior update is not a defect, but the speak to chat feature, which stops the playback whenever it detects a human voice. I understand the point of this feature, but Sony should calibrate it better.  As it is, even when set on low sensitivity and not to focus on voice, it still stops playback at even low human voice volumes.  As a practical matter, this means you can't sing or hum along to songs without having the playback constantly cut off.  I've wound up disabling this feature.<br/><br/>Other than that, the new headphones have been great -- super noise cancelling and music quality, decent phone call quality (maybe not best in class but more than serviceable), and day-in, day-out comfortable.  The only reason I didn't rate them at 5 stars is that this set, like the previous one, has a very high default volume, such that sometimes when you turn the headphones on, the music will start blasting out at an uncomfortably high volume. (I think that if you use another set of headphones, as I sometimes do, the XM4 will forget its last volume setting.)<br/><br/>UPDATED:  I decided to mark these down from 3 to 2 stars because, in the last few days, the bluetooth has started to act buggy.  Audio files simply stop playing for no apparent reason (in some cases, my music has stopped apparently because someone else with a bluetooth device gets within about 30 feet of me, but in other cases the music stops for no apparent reason at all).  At other times, there are skips or pops.  While the noise cancellation is fantastic, and I'm still thinking keeping them for this reason alone, I'm now more likely to return them -- $350 is just too much money for these kinds of problems.<br/><br/>These are great headphones -- outstanding in many respects -- but they have some issues that, given the $350 price, do not merit a 5-star review.  I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but decided on the lower rating given the very high price for this product.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>1) ANC -- by far, these have the most effective noise cancellation of any ANC (or other) headphones I have used, including Bose.  They drown out almost all ambient noise -- including close lawn mowers, leaf blowers, revving car engines, etc. -- even when you're not playing music or listening to another kind of audio file.  When playing music or an audio file, you are very much in your own world.  I did have an issue at the beginning where I could hear a static-like sound when ANC was on but no audio was playing.  A software or firmware update pretty much, but not entirely, eliminated the issue; it's still noticeable from time to time, but at a very low volume, lower than the older set of wired Bose ANC headphones I still have.  It's no longer an issue for me; I think that this kind of noise is a "feature" of ANC headphones.<br/><br/>2) Comfort -- by far, these are the most comfortable set of headphones I have used.  The ear pieces in particular are outstanding.  I bought another brand of (much less expensive) headphones right before I got these and wrote a review in which I said those were very comfortable.  However, I wound up returning those because, after about a week, they became quite uncomfortable.  These Sony headphones, however, have withstood the test of time, seeming to become more comfortable as time goes on.  I can comfortably wear these for hours.<br/><br/>3) Music quality -- excellent, what you would expect of Sony.<br/><br/>4) Gesture controls -- the gesture controls for turning music on / off, picking up a phone call, volume and next / previous song work quite well.  I had a set of Sony 900 headphones prior to these, and the gesture controls work a little better on these.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>1) Default volume -- for some reason, these headphones, like my prior Sony 900 headphones, seem to have a high default volume and there is no way in the Sony Headphones or Sony Music Center to change them (and there is also no native iPhone setting that works, either).  The result is that, all too often, music comes blasting out at an uncomfortable, probably unhealthy volume when you put the headphones on and start playing music.  Beside the Sony 900, none of the other (many) headphones I have used have had this issue.  I have now become accustomed to checking the iPhone's bluetooth volume when I put the headphones on, but all too frequently when the iPhone shows a low bluetooth volume, the volume resets itself to a much higher (almost max) volume when I actually start playing an audio file.  I believe the problem must be related to the fact that all the settings for these headphones are run through the Headphones app and there is no control for default volume in that app; apparently, Sony sets a near-max default volume and doesn't allow users to change it.  It's really quite annoying, and I may wind up returning these headphones for this reason.  For $350, Sony could do a lot better on this metric.<br/><br/>2) Phone call quality -- meh.  Some calls are good, others not so much.  Nobody on the other end has complained about call quality.  However, on my end, the other person often sounds distant, low volume, in a tunnel, etc.  Every other set of wireless headphones I have used with phone call capability has been at least as good as these headphones, and some have been better.  I read that the MX4 is supposed to have corrected the problems of the MX3 regarding phone call quality issues but, if that's the case, I can only imagine how bad the MX3s were.<br/><br/>3) Making you register with Sony in order to get updates -- as noted above, I needed to do a software or firmware update to get rid of the static noise when ANC is turned on.  However, to get software updates, Sony requires you to register with it (provide email, etc.).  It is obnoxious of Sony to require users to provide this kind of personal information that it will then market and sell, and presumably also spam you with promotions, as a precondition to getting updates to fix the bugs in its (expensive) products -- particularly where Sony has a history of data breach.<br/><br/>Bottom line, these are mostly excellent headphones, and they are exceptional with regard to the primary purposes of noise cancelling headphones.  However, they do have some problems that a $350 set of headphones should not have.  I'm likely to keep them, but if the default volume issue noted above does not improve, I may well return them.

In passive mode, the sound quality is all over the place, resulting in some of the worst headphones I've ever used in this price bracket. In active mode, it's... decent, with boomy, mildly unclean bass; acceptable mids; and messy but listenable highs. It is very responsive to EQ past sub-bass range, though you can crank up the already boomy mid-bass if that's your thing and it can get pretty loud. At about 70–80% volume, the amp begins to distort, and at 100% volume the distortion is highly audible and really crunches the highs and muddies the bass. There is also a noticeable frequency response and volume difference between the cups, likely due to the indentation for the sensor array inside the left cup; if you aren't listening for it, it is still noticeable sometimes, but it fades to the background if you are using the noise canceling or are otherwise occupied.<br/>The ambient sound feature does not pick up outside sounds very clearly. If you're using the Sony | Headphones Connect app, you can enable a "voice mode" for ambient sound that cuts out the bass and boosts vocal range with EQ, but it cannot be turned on with the toggle buttons on the headphones themselves or when connected to PC, making it tedious to enable without the automatic switching feature that tracks your location and habits to enable it when it thinks you need it. The noise canceling however is truly top of its class and easily removes 80–90% of outside noise, and you can't hear anything else if you're playing something. I have noticed that the DSP appears to crank up the bass, either to compensate for the harder-to-remove low-end frequencies or to trick you into thinking the noise canceling is better than it really is in that range.<br/>The ear cup touch controls work fine and I have not had any mis-inputs, though volume up/down steps are too small. You can hold down the up/down slider instead of repeatedly sliding your finger, but the repeat delay is very long and it takes forever to adjust to what you want.<br/>The headphones are fairly adjustable to different head shapes, but if you have a reeeally big head/ears or lots of hair it may be difficult. The headband padding is a bit hard but the headphones are so light you can't feel it. The closed cups have no ventilation so your ears stay warm, and I imagine it would get sweaty in warmer weather.<br/>The headphones can fold flat and can sit around your neck comfortably. The auto-pause when it detects you remove them, and the 15 minute auto-off means you don't ever need to bother turning them off explicitly, just take them off your head and put them down. Their ability to fold also works great for stowing them, and you can fit them into any bag. The included carry case is a bit bulkier than it probably needs to be, but it's still small enough to fit in even a medium sized purse, and it does have room for cables and small accessories.<br/>The mic quality is pretty bad and doesn't pick up your voice well. What it does pick up well is everything around you. You'd think Sony's engineers could have used the ambient sound mics to dampen outside noise while focusing on your voice, but it unfortunately doesn't do that. Call sound quality in general takes a major dive due to the protocol it uses under the hood; it halves the sample rate and sounds like a cheap dollar store headset.<br/>The battery is massive; I charged it to 90% once I received it a few days ago and have not had to charge it since with daily listening. Rtings.com got 37 hours out of one charge, far past the advertised duration.<br/><br/>Overall all of the features work to an acceptable level, except passive mode sound quality. If you are buying these for the battery longevity, small stowable size, ease of use, and noise isolation and canceling, they're a great package. Great for traveling. Would not recommend for even casual listening, get a good closed back pair like the Hifiman HE-R9 + Bluemini R2R wireless dongle. If you need to make important calls or want headphones for conference calls or online meetings, these will work, but it won't be pleasant—get a dedicated conference headset.<br/><br/>If you really insist on these for more active listening situations, do yourself a favor and get the AutoEQ preset for them as a baseline, and tweak to your ears. I also recommend a -1dB loss on the left earcup to help offset the response difference, though it's an approximation and not perfect and differences in track volume will make this obvious. With these changes, passive mode is at least bearable.

I've owned the Sony 1000XM3, H900N, and the Bose QC35 II.  I couldn't wait for the XM4 to come out because of the multipoint Bluetooth (I'll get to that a little later).  The sound is great once it's been adjusted, and the noise cancelling in the XM4 is better than both the XM3 and the QC35 II.  However, there are quite a few things that are very poorly implemented and basically unusable.<br/><br/>Sound: A-<br/>First off the XM4, XM3, and H900N all have better and brighter sound than the QC35 II.  Out of the box, the sound is a little dull and the mids / vocals are a little mushy.  With the XM4, I needed to tweak it in the Headphones app using the EQ to get it to the place that I wanted it, but once it was there, it was great.  A small but pleasing improvement in the XM4 is that the headphone voice announcements are at a much higher quality.  The XM3 announcements are low fidelity and low bandwidth whereas the XM4 headphone voice is very crisp and hi-fi.  Sony also replaced the high-pitched beep with a slightly longer but more pleasant sounding bell for feedback.  However, I actually prefer the beep because it's faster.<br/><br/>Noise cancelling: A-<br/>When I first put on the XM4 and turned them on, I was surprised by the audible hiss from the noise cancelling.  It wasn't present with the XM3.  I think this is because they have cranked up the noise cancelling in the XM4.  I have air purifiers running in my house, and the XM4 does a better job of cancelling out the noise almost completely.  The XM3 still has some leakage.  The XM3 is just as good as the Bose in noise cancellation, and the XM4, though a little hissy and is a slightly bit better.  The drawback to this is that it can feel like it's creating a slight pressure in my head that increases over time.<br/><br/>Multipoint Bluetooth: F<br/>This was the feature I had been waiting for.  The awesome noise cancellation and sound of the XM3, but with the ability to stream two devices at once.  FAIL!  I had been eagerly anticipating this and checking daily for the release of the XM4.  I was so excited to get them...only to be sorely disappointed.  Though the device will connect to two devices simultaneously, it actually DISCONNECTS when one of the two devices is activated.  So it's not true multipoint Bluetooth.  Sony advertises that the multipoint Bluetooth is seamless.  This is true if they mean you don't have to press any buttons to disconnect from a device.  However, the way it manages connections is very poor.  I have to put the XM4 into pairing mode if I've connected to my phone in order for it to play audio from my computer.  If I don't do this, it doesn't recognize that my computer is playing sound, and then doesn't stream the sound.  Even though it shows on my computer as connected, it doesn't show up in my sound options as a device that I can use for audio.  I have to turn them off, put them into pairing mode, and then reconnect in order to get the sound to play.  If a call comes in on my phone, the headphones actually disconnect from the computer to switch to the call - and the headphone voice announces that they have disconnected, super annoying and not seamless.  With the QC35 II, I could use both at the same time, with the phone being connected at the low-quality voice mode and my computer at the high quality music mode.  They had 2 years to get the multipoint Bluetooth right and they totally failed.  So it ends up that I have to turn the XM4 off and re-pair them just like I had to with the XM3.  I've had to do this a number of times, and I haven't quite figured out all the exact situations where I have to re-pair them.  With the XM3, I knew if I wanted to switch devices, I would have to do it.  But with the XM4, I haven't put my finger on all of them just yet.  At any rate, the switching of devices is very clunky and definitely not worth upgrading for.  I have $40 headphones that implement multipoint Bluetooth better than the XM4. I'm stunned and disappointed that Sony hasn't been able to get multipoint Bluetooth to work right.<br/><br/>Comfort: A<br/>Compared to the XM3, the XM4 are slightly softer and a bit more comfortable right when I put them on.  The XM3 are still pretty comfortable, but the earpads are definitely firmer and a little tighter.<br/><br/>Controls: B<br/>I totally prefer the actual buttons on the QC35 II to the touch controls.  Sometimes if I want to change the volume and I slide my finger at a slightly off-angle, it will skip tracks instead.  It's a small annoyance.  On the plus side, the physical buttons do make a fairly audible click that travels through the headphone, whereas the touch controls are a little quieter.<br/><br/>In-call: D<br/>One thing the Bose QC35 II does is that when I'm on a call, it knows to automatically turn on ambient sound mode so I can hear myself talking.  Neither the XM3 nor the XM4 figured out that this is a useful and great feature, so they don't do it.  If I want it, I have to press the button to switch to it, listen to the announcement, and then it comes on.  Then when I'm done, I have to press the button and wait for it to go into NC off, ambient sound off, and then press the button again and wait for the announcement that the NC is once again activated.  Super slow and awkward and unusable.  So instead, I pull one of the earcups off my ear so I can hear myself speak.  When I first was using the Sony's for calls, I was finding that my voice was tired and my throat sore at the end of the day.  Someone told me that I talked really loud when I was on the phone.  I didn't even know this because the headphones do a really great job of keeping outside sound out, so I was talking at a level so I could hear myself when I was wearing them.  I asked Sony support about this, and the headphones just don't do this.  Fail.<br/><br/>Auto-mute: F<br/>Sony created a feature where the headphones will automatically mute the audio source if it detects that you're talking.  Nice in concept - terrible in practice.  I just turned it off and left it off.  If I'm listening to music and sneeze or make a noise, the headphones will interrupt what I'm listening to and mute it for the amount of time I've specified in the app - 15 seconds is the shortest amount of time.  So I have to wait for it to unmute so that I can continue listening.  What's even more annoying is when I'm using the auxiliary cable in wired mode - again, this is because the multipoint Bluetooth implementation is such a pain and sucks, if I'm on a video conference and I have the headphones on to use the noise cancelling, if I talk, it mutes the audio stream for 15 seconds so I can't hear what anyone in the conference is saying.  So I then have to turn the headphones off in order to interact with the conference in any meaningful way.<br/><br/>Miscellaneous:<br/>I don't understand why Sony doesn't just include a headphone cable with a microphone.  With all the video-conferencing I do, and the terrible multipoint Bluetooth implementation, I end up using the auxiliary headphone cable a lot.  It's much faster and convenient for me to switch the plug from my computer to my phone rather than dealing with the horrible Bluetooth switching.  The auxiliary cable Sony provides doesn't have a microphone, so I have to hold my phone close to my mouth if I'm using the cable.  I ended up buying an auxiliary cable with a microphone and some playback controls on it and it works great.  Here's another really poorly thought-out thing: upon pairing the new XM4 with the app, it gives me the opportunity to give feedback on the headphones.  This is only upon the initial startup of the headphones.  How on earth can I give meaningful feedback about the headphones on my first use?  It took me to Sony's site to do the survey, and I decided I would complete it later, only to discover that it had timed out, and now I'm not able to provide feedback through that mechanism.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>All the hype about multipoint Bluetooth is a big letdown with the real product.  If that's the reason you're thinking about upgrading, don't do it.  The rest of it is pretty similar to the XM3.  Some nice little features added, but nothing earth shattering.  The new features on paper were everything that I wanted that was missing from the XM3.  In practice, the XM4 implementation of these things just did not hit the mark.  I soooo wanted to love these headphones, so that I could stop looking for headphones.  As it stands, they totally weren't worth the upgrade and I will most likely be sending these back.  Sadly, they are not as advertised.

Honestly, there was a part of me that was worried that these headphones would not be the best pair to own after the issues that I experienced with the prior generation of them: the WH1000xm3. The main issue that I had? The build quality: the plastic around the headband snapped due to a flimsy connection, resulting in me having to tape both headbands together so that the headphones don't fall apart on me. I tried several alternate brands to see if they would work, but they never came close to giving me the same level of satisfaction while wearing them as the WH1000xm3 did, even with the taped headband taken into account. So I decided that the best replacement for a Sony headphone was another Sony headphone, and I invested in the M4, which succeeded the M3 last year (as of this writing).<br/>My initial thoughts were as follows: the headphones were a definite improvement upon the originals, retaining what I liked most about the original headphones (largely the overall comfort) while also improving the headphones in other small ways (especially in regards to the special features-the M4 are way more feature-packed than the M3 were, incorporating many elements that are being found on most other headphones these days). My favorite thing that was fixed, however, was the sound quality. You see, the original sounded amazing, and honestly sounded better overall than the likes of Bose and Sennheiser, which I have tested as potential replacements for the Sony headphones. And that is despite the fact that the headphones have a relatively small 40mm driver inside, instead of a more traditional 50mm driver. However, the one minor issue I had with the M3 was that the low frequencies were heightened a bit more than I would have liked, making songs sound a bit bass-heavy even when the EQ was turned off (the only way I was able to fix this was by setting the EQ to 'bright', which isn't ideal since the EQ does degrade the battery life). With the M4, Sony improves this by tuning down the low ends, resulting in the headphones having a very flat frequency response, which in turn results in every song having a much wider sound stage than the M3 did (and almost making them sound as good as the various open-back headphones I have tried, including the Sennheiser 650, which is my personal favorite open-back headphone).<br/>In terms of the special features, I think they were implemented quite well in these headphones. The noise cancelling is exceptional, much like it was on the M3, and the transparency mode is somehow even better than it was on the prior generation headphone, sounding a lot more natural and less tinny overall. The auto activation of transparency mode during conversations is fantastic, and enables me to talk to people naturally without ever having to remove the headphones from my ear. This also means that I don't have to awkwardly tap my hand on the earcup with the M4, either. The DSEE Extreme audio enhancer really helps to make music sound a lot more full, even when using devices that don't support the LDAC wireless standard. It isn't as good as listening to lossless files wired, mind you, but it is still an amazing feature that helps to take advantage of the flat sound stage and frequency response of the headphone drivers.<br/>Now, this isn't to say that these headphones don't have issues, mind you. The auto-pause when removing the headphones from your ears is very much a gimmick, and doesn't always pause the song (and may even resume the music before you have a chance to place the headphones back on your ear). Since the headphones use a light sensor to tell if you are wearing your headphones or not, it means even a simple shadow can cause the headphones to think that they are back on your ears and restart music playback. It is quite obnoxious, and it is best left out. Another, more minor issue is the touch controls. While I personally have no issue with them, I know that there are many people that don't like them whatsoever. So I will just make a note that they are still here, and they work in much the same way as they did on the M3. Finally, I should mention that the flat soundstage, while amazing for my listening experience, may not be for everyone. Bassheads in particular would likely prefer extra pronunciation on the lower ranges. And while they will never be quite as bass-heavy as the Skullcandy or Beats line, the EQ can still bring the bass levels up quite a bit, using a 'clear bass' slider that reminds me of the slider on the Skullcandy Skullcrushers: raising the bass without causing distortion.<br/>Overall, the headphones turned out to be quite an exceptional pair, especially when it comes to listening to music during commutes. The great noise cancelling, beautiful audio, and fantastic transparency mode definitely make these headphones a winner in my book. And the app only helps to improve the flexibility of the headphones, allowing for many different features to be unlocked. And while these headphones certainly have some issues (no pair of headphones are perfect, after all), I think the benefits more than outweigh the issues for me, and put these at the top of my list of best closed-back headphones that I have worn. Hopefully Sony will continue to make amazing headphones like these in the ears to come.

I've been looking for some noise canceling headphones and once these went on sale for Prime day, it was a no brainer that these were the headphones to get. Although there's a newer version out, many reviews have continued to praise this version and its ability to fold in on itself and greater adjustments for the ear cups. My goals for a headset were a lightweight, wireless, and noise canceling to use with my PC, phone, and video game consoles. I didn't really plan on using these for traveling since I prefer to travel very light with just some earbuds.<br/>Upon first use, I was amazed by noise canceling ability just by putting it on. Even turned off, the ear cups create a great seal around your ears against outside noise. The sound optimizer is amazing and truly does find a great setting to cancel out the most noise taking into account little details like its placement on your head and atmospheric pressure. Many reviews have stated it feels like you get transported to a different place when you use the headphones because it immerses you into your music and although I can see where they are coming from, there were times I were a bit underwhelmed from its noise canceling ability since I could still hear my fan in  the background but when I removed my headphones and realized how loud the fan actually is next to me, I was like alright these are pretty good. When I'm working on my desk, sometimes people sneak up without me knowing because the noise canceling is that effective. The ambient noise with focus on voice doesn't do well when someone is talking to me and does become a hassle to remove every time, versus my Samsung earbuds' ambient mode allows me to talk to others without fully removing them from my ears.<br/>Sound quality is great in my opinion and the difference is significant from my daily Logitech headphones. I am using Logitech G435s for my PC for its superior light weight and very light pressure against my head, not really for mic and sound quality. While these headphones' 254 grams weight took some getting used to for me coming from a mere 165 grams headset, it is still quite comfortable to use for long periods of time. In the beginning, I was debating if I should return them because they didn't fit as well on my small head as the small Logitech g435s did and the Sonys ear cups put significant uncomfortable pressure against my jaw and side of head, but after using them as my daily for weeks, the pressure loosened and has become a lot more comfortable. I barely feel any discomfort nowadays, but the pressure against my jaw is still present and noticeable. While snug enough to use for work, these are too loose to use on my small head during exercise. They fall off my head very easily and are too warm for me to use during strenuous activity. These are too expensive to risk breaking at the gym. Because my head is a bit too small for these headphones, I have to be more conscious of the headband placement. I find myself readjusting it on my head more often than my previous headset, but this small annoyance wasn't big enough to warrant a return yet.<br/>I really like these headphones and the noise cancellation is amazing! Sound quality is great. However, ambient mode for having conversations without removing the headphones is poor. Battery life is great, but I haven't tested it to its limits yet. Touch gestures and use of buttons have worked well for me, no issues. I'd say that the comfort level is a B tier for my small head, but manageable. Heavier than what I'd like. This is where the headphones score the worst for me, but everything else is pretty good and I'm more than happy with this purchase for the price.

I am not an audiophile or one to buy expensive gadgets. But I needed a good set of cans to use while I work from home. I've been reading reviews on these since nearly the start of the human malware. But I just could not justify the expense. I caught these on sale and bit the bullet. I wish I had done it sooner. Great sound and great mic output. Every one of my callers, when asked, would say I sounded great and would have never known I was on  Bluetooth headphones unless they were told.<br/>Awesome ANC<br/>Great fit - I have a large head. And I can go 10-12 hours in these no problem, Does get a tiny bit warm on hot days but the fan and ac negate that issue. And the ANC and mic hide all the extra noise from the background and calls.<br/>Decent for PC gaming. Not sure I would invest in these for the sole purpose. But if you use these for work and pleasure. These will fit the gaming audio check box. Not sure if it works for voice chat because I don't play any game with that feature.<br/>Having two devices connected at once was the main feature I was going for and it is implemented flawlessly here. I can be taking in content from the PC and a phone call comes in. Rings in the ear and on phone. Pick up call no problem, PC content auto pauses. Then pick back up right after the call ends. The only odd thing is notifications used to play in ear. For some reason that stopped. But no reason to take off a star.<br/><br/>But then the headphones started to act up. Loud piercing sound in the left ear. Imagine being next to a concert speaker when there is mic feedback. Right in your ear. Not fun. Power reset sometimes fixed it. Sometimes it didn't.  Then other times the left ear would click. Sounded like a light switch being flipped off and on over and over. It got really bad after a few days so I chose to return them. I suspect the item I got may have been used? Upon closer inspection, the matte finish on the outside looked a bit "worn in". I wish I had paid closer attention in the beginning, but I was so excited to use them, I didn't pay attention. I would have liked to exchanged these for a new pair but the return process did not offer that as an option. Maybe that was on purpose? Who knows. But if I catch these on sale again I will definitely get another pair. Actively searching for the same deal. If you are in the market for a decent pair of ANC headphones that check most if not all of the boxes AND budget is not an issue. These are the way to go.

UPDATE 11/11/20:  With the release of firmware 2.0.7 these have become usable for conference calls on Windows 10. The issue with initial syllables getting cut-off appears to be fixed and overall I have reports when using Skype and Zoom from my co-workers is that I now sound as good as (or maybe even a bit better than) other co-workers using Bose NC 700 headphones. According to Sony's release notes this firmware update is only supposed to address connection stability on Windows. I have increased my rating to 4 stars.<br/><br/>UPDATE 10/30/20:  No update from Sony on the microphone issue.  My co-worker have asked that I use a different microphone as the microphone audio is quite poor.  I'm outside the Amazon return window, but am currently working with Sony to hopefully get these at least exchanged if not returned.<br/><br/>UPDATE: After a week, I am getting many complaints from people on the other end of my conference calls.  Zoom / WebEx / etc. This is a serious issue that impacts me on a daily basis. I have put a case into Sony support and hoping they release a new firmware soon to fix the call quality.<br/><br/>Below is my "evergreen" review which I will update whenever I have revised my opinion of these phones due to either new experiences or updated firmware, etc.<br/><br/>Compared to my 2 year old Sony WH-H900N:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>+ More equalization options, including the ability to use the EQ with LDAC codec.<br/>+ Stronger ANC, particularly high-pitched whines and voices are significantly more attenuated by the XM4. Airplane or fan noise is not hugely different. Overall the ANC on the XM4 is superior.<br/>+ True multipoint connectivity allows you to connect the XM4 to two different devices simultaneously. Both AD2P and HSP profiles can be simultaneously connected to 2 different devices.  The H900N can independently connect their AD2P and HSP profiles to two different devices which can allow music to be played on a PC while using a phone for voice calls, but it is tricky to connect/disconnect the correct profiles each time you power cycle the headphones. The XM4 are much improved on this front, although the priority switching is a bit dodgy in my opinion and takes a few seconds to detect and switch devices, so it's easy to miss notifications or other brief sounds when multiply connected.<br/>+ The XM4 are better for making calls in noisy environments, although the overall quality is mediocre at best. Any halfway decent gaming headset or office headset will do a better job of capturing just your voice. I tested versus my Sennheiser G4ME One wired headset.<br/>+ (slightly) more compact travel case since the earcups both swivel and fold whereas the H900N only fold<br/>+ XM4 allows you to mix in a variable amount of ambient sound whereas the H900N has only 1 setting for ambient sound<br/>+ The WH-1000XM4 while improved, are still poor in windy situations, even when put into "wind" mode, which does help. I haven't had a chance to compare the XM4 on a voice call in windy environments. The H900N are unusable in wind for phone calls, I have to switch to the handset.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- The WH-1000XM4 have significantly less Bluetooth 4.0 range, I get crackling and break-up within 3 meters where the WH-H900N easily reach 10 meters. This is a big deal when working from home. With the H900N I could make a phone call from the kitchen with my computer in the office and be pretty confident that I could still speak and hear everything.  With the XM4 I can't leave my office without huge glitching. EDIT: I swapped out my BT4.0 adapter to a BT5.0 adapter on my desktop and with this, I can get ~20 meter range with my XM4, still not quite as good as the H900N gets with BT4, but acceptable for my uses.<br/>- Overall, WH-1000XM4 do not sound much better, in fact at default factory settings, the midrange is a bit muffled and bass response bloated versus older headphones, tweaking Clear Bass setting to -2 helps<br/>- The WH-1000XM4 ANC presents a low-level background hiss and a sucking sensation on the ears<br/>- The WH-1000XM4 do not support Qualcomm aptx codecs<br/>- The WH-1000XM4 have worse microphone quality when used in quiet environments.<br/>- Hold-hand-to-right-earcup-to-speak actually works better on the older headphones as Sony apparently wants you to use the deeply problematic speak-to-chat automatic feature instead<br/><br/>Equal:<br/>* Battery life is roughly the same, with ~24 hours for the older headphones versus ~30 hours for the newer<br/>* Bluetooth pairing is similarly slow on both headphones<br/>* Both support LDAC codec for high bitrate sound (although when in 2-device mode LDAC cannot be used)<br/>* Overall weight and comfort is similar, with the XM4 being a bit lighter<br/>* Ear heat is a problem with both headphones, slightly cooler on the XM4<br/>* Neither headphone can use the microphone when listening via wired connection, come on Sony!<br/>* Neither headphone can be used as a USB headset (even though the phones are recognized by Windows 10, they do not show up as an audio device)<br/>* Touch controls are essentially identical, in fact the H900N are actually a bit more responsive although perhaps I'll get used to the XM4<br/><br/>Personal Preference:<br/>* The style of the older headphones is a bit nicer in my opinion, and they are available in more colors<br/>* The newer XM4 use USB-C charging versus micro-usb for the older headphones. This should be a pro for the XM4 but the XM4 won't charge on any of my USB-C PD chargers, so I have to either plug them into a port on my computer or find an old low-power phone charger to charge them. The H900N are less finicky about what charger they will accept.<br/>* The "silver" XM4 is really a grayish-beige which is pretty ugly, I wish I'd have bought boring basic black.<br/><br/>Overall I am disappointed that these are not a bigger upgrade over my 3 year old headphones. I knew from various reviews that the H900N sounded better than the 1000XM, and 1000XM2, with reviews being a bit equivocal on the XM3. I was expecting the XM4 to blow the H900N away, but really they are barely better except for multipoint and ANC.

So many awesome things to like : Lightweight, collapsible folding hinges allow easy stowage into very cool zipper case they come with, shape of cushion around ear is a distinct oval shape on top that leads to narrow bottom that’s extremely comfortable, large white letters signify “R” or “L” inside ears over speaker, super simple 4 straight buttons in a row controls that are appreciated for safety when biking/skating, and a SEPARATE power switch on side away from controls, no pain in the rear part of controls that creates unwanted annoying cluster, intelligent design. All of that before mentioning the INCREDIBLE sound clarity. Very nice hi-end treble with a surprisingly bumpy bass with the mids sandwiched in the right place in between. Thankful I found these, well worth it, they could easily charge more and still be a tremendous value.

So, I was hesitant about getting these at first, but upon reading the reviews, some of them seemed promising, I decided to try a set out.<br/>Before this, I used a picun headset, which is, by far, my fav brand of headphones. Unfortunately, that set suddenly broke last month and I came upon these while looking for new ones.<br/>I've used the powerlocus headset for probably 2 or 3 weeks so far and so<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Great sound<br/>Noise cancellation is pretty good<br/>Aesthetic (love how they look!)<br/>Comes with a headset case (a huge plus, cause most sets don't come with one!)<br/><br/>Cons<br/>The buttons can be difficult to keep track of (I've pressed the radio one before when trying to hit pause instead)<br/>The sound sometimes randomly pause on mine for a moment, but it doesn't happen too much so it's not a deal breaker<br/><br/>So far I'm loving these! I bought the black+orange set and wow they're gorgeous! Probably the best looking headphones I've had so far. The case with the clip is such a nice addition, great for travelling! I had to buy the case separately for my picun set. In terms of sound quality, I still prefer picun as they have amazing bass and great sound. However, these aren't bad for what they're. And for the price, makes em ever better!<br/><br/>If you like your headsets to be more sound heavy, I'd recommend picun. They're slightly more pricy but they go on sale sometimes. They last quite a while too. I've used 2 headsets from them so far. The first one worked super well for a year and so, the second set worked pretty good too but adruptly broke after using them for 4 or so months. However they're a great buy and I highly recommend them. Perfect for headbanging lmao<br/><br/>If you just want a headset that sounds great and looks great, and more affordable, then I'd say go for this! (using them right now as I type this!) It's really up to your preference, but these won't break your wallet and I've heard very good things about their customer service. Plus they look awesome too! Several color options that look beautiful together. I'm tempted to get a second pair sometime!

The size of my ears is weird and I have spent a lot of time crawling on the gym floor looking for my stray ear bud. I don't do any high intensity exercising but I have run on the treadmill with these on and they stay snug. Sound quality is all right but I still haven't figured out how to skip to the next song. The instructions are complicated.
----
I’ve gone through a few pairs of earbuds and finally decided to go for over the ear headphones. I am so pleased with these! They’re comfortable, they stay connected and the sound is GREAT! Amazing bass! They were comfy at the gym and laying in ed watching tv on my iPad! For $25 I’d highly recommend these for an inexpensive, quality sound headphone option. The only thing I’d say is that they are not completely noise cancellingn but they’re good enough for my use.
----
Good way to be able to listen to audio coming off of an iPhone. However, the headphones do not have any indication of the battery life.
----
Headset quality is perfect very sturdy and comfortable buttery life is about 4hrs depending how long you used them. I would recommend them.
----
I listen to YouTube videos. This headphone pairs to my Bluetooth device  much better than other head set. However I don’t hear the first 3 seconds of the video.  I like how it folds and the case it comes with is superior. I might not buy another.
----
Love the color and the fit on my head. It's easily extendable and lightweight! The Bluetooth capability works great too. The only thing is the AUX cable easily got bent (only after a couple years of use), and it ruined the ability for me to listen to things properly when plugging into devices. However, I was able to contact the support team about this issue and they willingly sent me another AUX cable. You can say that I am certainly satisfied with my purchase! :)
----
I would recommend to a friend and be confident they would like them as well.
----
**EDIT**<br/>I originally received a different model than I ordered &amp; successfully got it exchanged for the correct one.<br/>The noise cancellation is okay, I can still hear things around me, but I'm okay with that. The sound is a bit echoey at times, but the bass is good<br/>I am writing this just after opening the package, so I will most likely update this later. In the photo it is advertised as a white headset with purple accents. As you can see from my photos, I received a purple and white headset that does not have any particular design as shown in the product photos. I do like the color, but was surprised when it didn't look the same

This is exclusively a PC review, so keep that in mind. Your mileage may vary depending on your console. That said, most of this will hold true regardless of platform.<br/><br/>This is the first Hyper X product I've owned, and I've got to say I'm very impressed. Even at this price point, the sound quality beats out much more expensive Logitech headsets I've bought in the past.<br/><br/>These aren't ANC headphones, so there will be some audio bleed from the outside world, though at higher volumes this issue rapidly dissipates. Bass is on the heavier side, as it is with most gaming headsets, while mids and highs are well represented and not over saturated.<br/><br/>I don't use the mic much for anything (online gaming tends to be pretty toxic) but in the minor tests I've done with it, it sounds OK; it's not good, but it's not bad. I did however have an issue where the mic was extremely quiet, even at 30+db boost. I suspect this a Windows issue, but I could never figure out how to resolve it. I didn't test it on my PS4, but I assume from watching other reviews that its a serviceable, if unimpressive mic. Having to flip the mic boom up and down to mute yourself will become a little annoying, however, as there are no in-line controls for this beyond a volume slider on the right ear cup.<br/><br/>Knocking off a star for both the PC mic issues as the muting mechanism.<br/><br/>There is a DTS Headphone X two-year trial that comes with it and I strongly encourage folks to use it; it changes the sound stage of these headphones in a stellar way and everything from music, to movies, to games sounds better and has better positional audio. It's stupid that DTS X is a licensed program rather than a buy once and be done like Dolby Atmos, but that's not Kingston's fault.<br/><br/>For PC users, the extension cable is garbage. Either I got a faulty unit, or they just plain aren't good. When plugging in the headset to the extension cable, my volume drops dramatically and there appears to be a faulty connection between the cable and the 3.5mm jack on the headset itself, as if the connection isn't strong enough. I've fiddled with the wires and can't see anything specifically wrong. When plugging the headset directly into my front audio jack, everything sounds fantastic and DTS works as it should. There is a small chance that this could be a motherboard driver issue on my end, however, so take it with a grain of salt. I'm not taking a star off for this as I very rarely, if ever, will use the mic; however, for other PC users that use one frequently, you might want to consider either a different headset, or, the better option, buying a standalone mic (headset mics are often subpar, no matter what the price point).<br/><br/>Finally, this thing is lightweight, but not cheap feeling. It's all plastic construction minus the metal sliders, but it's very lightweight to the point of almost being unnoticeable on your head, even during long sessions. The memory foam ear cups are good, though the pleather exterior will heat up after a while and you may need to give your ears a cool off. This kind of cheap material is expected at this price point, but it still grates.<br/><br/>Overall, they Hyper X Cloud Stinger is a great entry level headset for $50. At the $30 I got it on sale for, and the price that it is at the time of writing this, it's an absolute steal and there's nothing else at all in that range that will even come close to this.

Sadly I have a cat who has decided wired headsets are a no go. They never chewed on any other wires I have but recently the two headsets I had were of soft wire. Kitten bit right through it. One was an expensive $300+ dollar high end headset that some streamers use, though in all honesty it wasnt worth that much. You would think a $300+ dollar headset would have a wire covered in the hard braided material. None the less the wire can be replaced, for how much I dont know, but I felt going with wireless would be the safe route for now though I sacrifice sound quality greatly.<br/><br/>Most headsets I have owned, wired, will always sound way better. Even my wired Cougar headsets were near this price or cheaper at the time but sounded like studio sound quality but I just dont want to risk it. Plus the wire was braided for that cheap. I wont be using the mic, since I have a high quality desk mic. I worry more over my mic then the headset. But for those trying to actually look for something that sounds good i would not go for these. You get what you paid for. A friend did recommend a headset a while back which I did buy and the sound quality was very very good for a wireless but it was not cheap compared to this but not as expensive as my $300+ ones. (Plantronics Gaming Headset, RIG 800HD Wireless Gaming Headset) Sadly the plastic of the Plantronics feels way thinner and cheaper than these ones. I accidentally dropped my Plantronics off my desk and part of one earphone broke and it was not repairable. I ended up tossing them out and going for the $300+ dollar headsets cause the boyfriend recommended them.<br/><br/>For the quality of the plastic I say these feel sturdy. I can shake my head and they are not flying off. But for sound I did take a star off. I feel like the sound quality compared to cheap headphones they offer you on a plane when you forget yours. The quality is basic, clear, with not much humph to the bass. But for the price I knew the risk, and my assumptions as to how it was going to sound was right. If you really care about sound quality and dont mine going wired, id highly suggest going with wired.

PROs:<br/>+ Audio quality is surprisingly good all-around, for music, movies, gaming, and Zoom meetings<br/>+ Relatively affordable compared to some gaming headsets you might need to take loan out to afford<br/>+ Flip-to-mute mic is clear and captures audio decently<br/>+ Onboard controls are intuitively laid out<br/>+ Lightweight and comfortable to use all day<br/>+ Subtle look is suitable for an office environment<br/>+ USB-C connector charges the headset quickly<br/><br/>CONs:<br/>- NGenuity software is Windows-only so limits the usefulness of the headset<br/>- Software leaves a lot to be desired<br/>- USB dongle required so it will take up a USB port<br/>- No Bluetooth support<br/>- Limited to 16-bit 48khz audio<br/>- No EQ to adjust audio<br/>- Shuts off after 10 minutes with no audio (and no ability to change this)<br/>- DTS:X support is either a trial or limited basis (couldn't get mine to activate the DTS:X license)<br/>- HyperX support is terrible, so don't expect help if you need it<br/><br/>A decent headset with good audio and some annoying limitations that aren't enough for me to dock it a star. The price is good, especially if you can find it discounted closer to $50. While not an audiophile-quality headset, the sound it does put out is surprisingly good across the board. I have not been disappointed by audio from music, movies, games, or even Zoom meetings. It is slightly bass heavy, and unfortunately (unlike some of the more expensive HyperX headsets) there is no equalizer to adjust this.<br/><br/>However, if you want a simple headset that you don't need to fiddle around with, this should more than meet your needs. The flip-to-mute mic is always a welcome addition, and this one works well, with clear vocal audio. I wouldn't recommend this if you want to record podcasts, although it will certainly do in a pinch. It seems to handle everything quite well.<br/><br/>I primarily use this as a backup headset when my primary headset dies, but I'm generally surprised with it each time I put it on. HyperX software and support leave A LOT to be desired, and I wish they would work on that, but with the affordable cost combined with the audio quality from the cans and microphone, I give these a lukewarm 5 stars. 4.5 stars is what I would give this if I could give it a half-star rating.

FIrst off, this is a great value for the money, its hands-down a very solid headset. I have some audiophile headsets and high end wired and wireless headsets, so I have been running the Stinger's through some gaming and music to compare. I purchased these because we have the Cloud I's and the Cloud II's in our home and I have had them for several years and they still look like new, so I knew that it would be comfortable and the sound signature would be tuned fairly well. These are a little more bass heavy in a standard gaming setup w/o a amp or Astro mixamp. The lows are very good, mids are decent, and the highs are good. Basically, the 53mm drives from the Clouds have been placed in these as 50 mm drivers because the only thing i can tell on audible testing is that the mids are clearer on my Cloud II's for gaming and music. If you use a mixamp then that is when you will not be able to tell the difference between Cloud I's or II's. I use these with a mixamp TR and they are very comfortable. I have large ears and these completely cover them while also providing decent noise cancellation. Something of note here regarding the noise cancellation, it is passive and is not as good as the Cloud II's, but I feel that the Cloud I and the II clamp down a little hard on my head and the Stingers do not clamp down. The memory foam ear pads and the lightweight frame make this a headset you will hardly notice. The build quality seems very good and as for the mic, it works fine and I have had no issues for this week of use. I would sum it up as 50 bucks well spent if you are on a budget or just looking for a comfortable headset because the Stinger's are both of those.<br/><br/>Now a few drawbacks I see about the headset from my perspective. The mic stays attached the entire time, so that may be a negative to some. Also no built in mic monitoring that I can tell in my mic testing I have done so far. On XB1 you can setup mic monitoring within the accesories app with a newer controller model  with a 3.5 mm jack and place it to an acceptable range. On PS4 testing it is pretty much no mic monitoring, but for 50 bucks I will say that everything all works with no glaring issues and again it is mixamp friendly which is super attractive. I would definitely take these over my A40 TR's just on the fact of comfort alone, not to mention the price. I hope that Kingston ultimately takes this exact Stinger build and makes it into a Stinger II with some higher level build quality and even wireless, that would be the best gaming headset around.<br/><br/>TLDR; The Stinger is a super comfy, mixamp friendly headset that sounds really close to its big brother the Cloud I and II's. Your going to be hard pressed to spend 50 bucks and find a better headset. I have compared many more expensive headsets to these and sound and comfort wise, these are right there with those headsets.<br/><br/>If my review of the Kingston HyperX Cloud Stinger has helped you make a decision about purchasing please give me a postive rating.

These are far from high-end gaming headphones, but the sound quality is very good for a casual gamer like myself, especially at the price point. They work well with my X Box controller.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. Swivel mic can also be flexed in any direction<br/>2. Mic on/off switch and volume control located on cord – no fumbling around by your ear to change the volume or turn mic on and off<br/>3. Ear pads are comfortable for long periods of play<br/>4. Adjustable fit should accommodate most any head sizes<br/>5. Comes with adapter cable for PCs with separate mic and headphone jacks<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. I don't love the wire Y split and running to each can, prefer a single wire<br/>2 Wire is permanently attached to headphones

Ive been using these for a while now so I think I can review them now.<br/>The sound is great, but they have to be sort of loud to sound great.<br/>The mic was the selling point for me, I found it handy to just flip it up to mute. Ive been told it sounds crisp<br/><br/>Parts I dont like about these<br/>A super long cable, like, annoyingly tripping over it if it's on the floor,and sending the headphones falling, long.  It's seriously almost a deal breaker for me. Some times I absolutely dont like these headphones for it.<br/><br/>A random crackle every now and then happens when you're trying to listen to something, that my other headphones wont at all in the same spot that these crackle.

Updated to 5 stars all in all this headset is great and once I got used to it, it was very comfortable. I have decided this headset does everything I need for now so I’m going to wait to order one with a mixer and more features. I’ve gotten used to the mic mute flip feature with more time and now it’s not so strange muting and adjusting volume (note: I normally adjust volume from Xbox mixer settings instead of the volume adjuster on the headset).<br/><br/>SUMMARY: I bought the Hyperx Cloud Stinger and at this time I’m giving 4 stars, however it is most likely a 5 Star Headset I just want some time to make sure. So far I I can honestly say this headset is well worth it just keep in mind I’ve only had it for about a week! It’s very comfortable, has great sound, a great price, seems to be working great with Xbox One, and is made with quality! I don’t think you find a headset in this price range that’s better than this one and many say this headset is better than very expensive ones from what I’ve read. I may wind up getting another Hyperx Cloud headset with a Audio mixer and mute button since I’m not sure I’ll get used to moving the mic up and down to mute it as you have to do with the Stinger (I’m used to a mute button by the controller which makes it fast and simple to mute) and I would like to control volume settings without going into my Xbox audio settings or hopefully Xbox makes a simplier option to this and muting. (You don’t need the adapter with this headset for Xbox one if you have the controller with a 3.5mm jack)<br/><br/>Long Review (Still updating and pending final product rating):<br/><br/>COMFORT: They are very comfortable to me (I am a female and most aren’t comfortable to me and are too big but without this headset adjusted at all it fits pretty comfortably). When it’s adjusted to be larger it fits my boyfriend as well so this is a great headset for either female or male.<br/><br/>SOUND:<br/>I’m not audio/sound wizard or professional but the sound so far is very good. I’ve mainly played Fortnite br and Destiny 2 with this headset. I’m still messing around with different games to see the difference between different noises and using the volume mixer settings on Xbox One to see what sounds best. On Xbox One I’m able to press the home button, go over to System, and then to Audio to control the headset volume, adjust headset chat mixer, or mic montitoring. This headset does have the slider on the right ear so you are able on XB1 to get all your volume levels setup and then just use the volume slider on the headset ear if it’s to loud or quiet. Now that I have messed around with it a bit more I don’t find the need to go back into the audio settings on Xbox to adjust them, I have left them at a certain level that seems to be working great. However, for me I liked having all those volume control settings next to the controller but again maybe I can get used to it. Last thing is I’m messing around with trying Windows Sonic and Dolby Atmos for headphones since I read you can use these features with headphones that don’t have surround sound or do have it and as some say it makes a world of a difference... I’m still testing this out on Xbox One to see if they do make a difference with sound.<br/><br/>MIC/PARTY CHAT: Using Xbox party chat is huge and a must for me. I use it to talk to my boyfriend who I play games with from different rooms as well as friends. The first day I got these, I connected to a party chat and instantly he stated it was making a humming or some sort of low pitched noise. He isn’t into tech issues or troubleshooting so this was very hard for me to fix or understand since only he heard this noise. The next day he said he doesn’t hear it at all but I’m still a bit concerned so I’ll be trying to join other people in a party to see if they hear anything not right. Update: it looks like this issue may have went away and was either related to being new, my boyfriends headset, and/or me being in the Xbox insider alpha program.<br/><br/>MUTE FEATURE: The other thing that may just be something I have to get used to is the mic mute method on this headset, having to pull the mic up or down is something I feel takes more time than just pressing a mute button like I’m used to but like I said maybe I’ll get used to it. My boyfriend likes the mute method that the Stinger has more than me since he has a habit of putting up his mic even with his mic not having this feature. I think this is just a preference and dependent on if you can get used to it.<br/><br/>OVERALL RATING: 9/10 I would recommend this headset to someone. For the price and the quality you get I don’t feel there’s a better headset you’ll find!! I hope my review helps you and if you have any questions leave a comment to this review and I’ll reply ASAP.<br/><br/>Note: I would also greatly appreciate it if my review was helpful for you, if you could please click the “was helpful” button below. Thank you :)

I'm not much of a "headset" guy. I don't play competitive games that require voice chat, so I have primarily used normal speakers for my PC setup. My sister and her kids started playing a multiplayer game and wanted me to join in. Was pretty fun but communication was a hurdle. I ordered these as a quick budget option so I could talk to them in-game. Everything worked right out the box (same day delivery too!). No complaints on comfort or sound quality. I'm using the included cable for Mic/in + audio on a Windows 10 machine.

I’ve always wanted to invest in a wireless headset but I spent so much time comparing. I added this to a private wishlist of mine to watch it when a friend mentioned she uses it and she sounded amazing in Discord calls, so when it went on a major sale, I snagged it immediately. I don’t regret it! Battery life has been wonderful, sound quality is amazing. The only thing that makes me give it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it shuts itself off if it doesn’t hear sound for a set period of time, and there’s no way to override the setting. There have been times where there has been sound on my computer, but it’s like it’s not loud enough or something, because it still shuts off. And occasionally it loses connectivity to my Discord after it shuts itself off and I have to turn it off and on again several times to be heard again. But otherwise, it’s amazing and definitely worth what I spent on it.

These headphones aren’t bad for $30 on sale. The sound quality is fine, the comfort is fine, I would say it’s a pretty good value. However, I had these for one month today and my cat chewed through the cord. Don’t buy these as a replacement to your other headphones if your cat chews on cords. It will just happen again.

I have been on the hunt for the RIGHT gaming headset for over a year. I have owned the Turtle Beach Stealth PX24, Hyper X Cloud Stinger, both the Playstation Gold and Platinum Wireless headsets. Then, I upgraded to the wire-happy, Astro A40 TR with mixamp. I felt the A40 was a bit, overpriced, performance-wise. THEN, I went to the Turtle Beach Stealth 520, which is wireless and has several, surround sound presets, including the featured, SuperHuman Hearing. However, it seemed, like each time I would game with the Stealth 520 for a bit, my ears and eventually, the head would start to sweat, due to the enclosed, faux-leather design of the ear cushions. Many times, I would snatch the headset off and play, without it. Then, I went to the Arctis Pro, which was superb in sound quality and builds. However, I returned them because they caused me to have headaches after gaming sessions. Then, I was on the hunt for another headset. However, I decided to go a different route and get some stereo headphones for gaming, which led me to find out about the semi-open back, HD688B by Superlux, which are superb, especially for its low price. However, I wanted to try an open-back pair of headphones, which is something I have never owned, previously. That led me to purchase the Audio-Technica ATH-700X. So, the question is, will I like open-back or return to closed or semi-open?<br/><br/>ATH AD700X VS. ATH AD500X: There has been, much confusion in what is the difference between the two. Amongst the many, design and specs similarities, the only difference is the ATH AD700X has a frequency response of 5-30KHz, while the ATH AD500X has a frequency response of 5-25KHz. Then, the ATH AD700X has an impedance of 38 ohms, while the ATH AD500X has an impedance of 48 ohms. Also, the ATH AD700X has a maximum output of 700 mW, while the ATH AD500X has a maximum output of 500 mW. The price discrepancy between both is $15.<br/><br/>DESIGN: Overall, the design of the ATH AD700X is good, overall. The double-hooped, headband is made up of a thick, wired, plastic structure, which looks cheap, but is extremely, durable. Underneath, is what Audio-Technica calls, 3D Wing Support, which is spring-loaded and self-adjusting for stability and comfort. Underneath the 3D Wings, which covers the head is made of mesh, fabric. Ear cups is lightweight, aluminum-honeycomb, which is transparent enough to see the drivers on the inside. The ear cushions are made of raised fabric ear cushions, similar to velour. Overall, the headphones have a bit of weight to them. In fact, some say the headphones are uncomfortable. However, I have no issue, when wearing them for long periods of time. Also, the headphones do not have any external buttons to work the headphones, like a volume button or an external mic, as it is not a gaming headset by default. PS4 users will have to change the volume by accessing the Volume Control (Headphones) option on the PSN settings menu. Not much of a hassle in my opinion. A mod-mic will be needed to use a microphone for these headphones.<br/><br/>SOUND: Instead of using the ordinary title, open-back, Audio-Technica uses what is called, Open-Air Dynamic technology. The Open-Air Dynamic technology was made to produce, lower pressure on the ears while listening. I must mention, they keep the ears cool. However, ordinary open-back headphones have sound leakage by default. This means sound from the headphones can be heard by others, nearby. In addition, the user will be able to hear some outside noise, as well. Honestly, I do not hear, much sound-leakage, while playing. Beneficially, open-air has a wider sound-stage, which creates an immersive, natural, surround sound-like, performance. Sounds can be heard, very clearly and accurately. Of course, sound performance, may vary, depending on where and how they are used. With that said, I will only be speaking from a video game, standpoint. The driver size is 53mm, which is very, large. As I mentioned, the frequency response is outstanding, 5-30KHz. The impedance of 38 ohms with a maximum input power is a whopping, 700 mW is impressive for protection from overload by various audio equipment. The sound can be pumped up with a DAC. I have a Neoteck 192hz DAC and Converter. I used it on these headphones and it pumped up the sound. However, they can put out some sound, without a DAC. Once, I connected the headphones to my PS4 Pro controller, along with turning the controller volume up on the PSN settings menu. Unlike many, gaming headsets, surprisingly, they can get mighty, using the controller.<br/><br/>Speaking of gaming, I tested the Open-Air Dynamic performance of the ATH AD700X, while playing Rainbow Six Siege and Call Of Duty Black Ops 4 on my PS4 Pro. The sound from the ATH AD700X, gave perhaps, the clearest and most authentic sound I have heard, while gaming with open-back headphones. I was more impressed with the open-air performance of the ATH AD700X, rather than with closed and semi-open, gaming headphones or headsets. Every sound was heard with crispness and ample, clarity from all angles with no distortion. The highs and mids were very, balanced. The lows are good, too. Great, but surprising, treble. In fact, it can be a little harsh on the ears. When playing Black Ops 4, the "squish" sound, when getting a kill, has me on edge because I am never prepared for that abrupt, loudness. The bass is there in the ATH AD700X, but not, much. I prefer a decrease amount of bass because I believe it drowns out some sound in my opinion. Of course, preference varies.<br/><br/>While testing the ATH AD700X on Rainbow Six Siege, which is a very, detail-oriented game, when it comes to a need of hearing, various sounds while playing. Having the right headphones can be essential to survival. Anyhow, my character, Ash, sent the drone around the area. She could hear the White Masks, shuffling back and forth, while crouched in cover positions, waiting to attack. She could hear, exactly, where they were, either behind a wall or other structures. She could hear footsteps of roving patrols, very clearly. Plus, hearing how close and how distant he was from her position while taking his patrol routes. Also, she could hear the White Masks, communicating with each other, while waiting in their cover positions. I could hear my character’s footsteps getting louder or softer, depending on movement speed. Knowing this, lets you know, when to move slowly, as your footsteps can also, be heard by the enemy. They WILL shoot through a wall if they hear you coming.<br/><br/>While testing the ATH AD700X on Call Of Duty Black Ops 4, I could hear gunfire, explosions, dialogue and other random sounds, which can be heard, throughout the map to the left and right of me were heard with an increasing amount of accuracy and clarity. I knew, EXACTLY, what was going on and where the action was taking place on the map, especially on the Nuketown. I felt, as though I had been thrown directly into the middle of a war. The ATH AD700X picks up small sounds, like a vacuum, thanks to the headphones lows. For example, on the Morocco map, outside of hearing the common sounds, during game-play, I could hear the subtle, clinging and breakage of pottery, kicked around, while traversing the area. Also, hearing voices from other Specialists on the maps, who were at a bit of a distance. I could, barely here this with other headsets, but in more abundance, but not with the ATH AD700X. The crunching sound, as my character was trampling through the deep snow and the crack of the ice on the Icebreaker map, sounded unbelievably, real. Once, my character, Battery, ran inside of an open-ended bay of the Summit map. Battery was communicating, while outside and finished talking, while going inside of the bay. There was an echo of Battery's voice while speaking inside of that open-ended bay. The authenticity of the echo was unbelievable and nearly, scary.<br/><br/>Of course, I am sure, some are wondering about footsteps. Well, the ATH AD700X, picks up footsteps on Call Of Duty Black Ops 4, very well. I have been able to get the drop on enemies while ducking for cover and waiting on them to search for me. This happened, while on the Summit map, once. Battery ran up the stairs and took cover on the side of the building, looking toward the open trailer, while waiting on an enemy to pop out of the bay. Meanwhile, she heard footsteps to the left of her. She waited, patiently for the enemy to pass. Sure enough, it was Prophet, running towards the bay, where Battery was waiting on enemies to come out of. She ran up behind him and took him out. Immediately, she got fired upon from the rear. She immediately ran and hid in a corner, between some with tarp in-between the back of the opened, trailer door. Again, she heard footsteps from her left. This time, it was Crash. He came in front of her with his gun drawn. However, due to her being able to hear his footsteps and seeing his shadow on the ground, she was ready and took him out. Then, she saw another enemy coming on the mini-map. She went on the other side of the tarped crates with drums and skid, lying next to a yellow forklift. She heard footsteps on the left. It was Crash, again. This time, he was heading into the bay to take on some of Battery’s teammates. She took him out. Hearing footsteps, helped Battery take out three enemies. Be warned! Players cannot always, rely on hearing footsteps because of the nature of the going-ons, during matches, which is lots of gunfire, explosions, etc.<br/><br/>MIC (OPTIONAL): As I mentioned, a mod-mic will have to be purchased to utilize, while online gaming. The prices vary. I have not tried this, yet, as I do not have a mod-mic at this time. I do know, with one attached, it should perform, exceptionally, well.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Overall, the ATH AD700X is currently, a good price, considering it was once, sold for $200. In addition to that, Audio-Technica is a well-known and trusted, brand. At this point, when it comes to gaming in a quiet environment, I would argue that open back is the best way to go because of that sound, which I mentioned, above. At this point, when it comes to gaming, I will likely, not go back to closed-back headphones or a headset.

So, I was in the market for some new headphones. A friend of mine had suggested the AudioTechnica<br/>ATH-M50x, but after perusing lots of extensive reviews on them I decided against them. The most important factor to me is comfort, and from what I had been reading about those, they weren't necessarily bad headphones, they just weren't very good ~$200 headphones. And apparently, they take "some getting used to" in terms of comfort. I was turned off by both of these sentiments and decided to look for something else. I figured open-back may be the way to go, and eventually settled on a pair of the ATH-AD700X's.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the best things about these headphones are, ironically, things a lot of people have outlined in their own reviews here as being negatives.<br/><br/>Let's start with the mechanism these use to stay on your head.<br/>You have likely seen many reviews here saying the mechanism these headphones use is "too loose". In my opinion, they are not too loose at all. They grip your head with a very light, feathery touch. At first it may feel like they could slip off if you just tilt your head the wrong way, but they will not. Unless you're thrashing your head to some VERY SERIOUS metal there is no way these are going to fall off, whether you're laying down in bed or sitting in a chair. Also, I have always had difficulty laying down in bed and using big headphones. More often than not, the cans just get shoved into strange, awkward positions, or the whole thing is really just gripping my head way too tight and it gets VERY uncomfortable VERY quickly. That is not the case with these headphones. They are extremely comfortable to wear in bed, and they sound great too.<br/><br/>Next, let's go to the cable.<br/>I've seen SO MANY reviews saying they hate the cable for being "too long", and they hate how the cable "coils up." In my opinion, these are actually things worthy of praise. I would rather have a pair of headphones with a cable that is too long than a pair with a cable that is one inch too short. NOTHING is more frustrating than that. As for the cable "coiling up", when in use this is never a problem. The cable is so long that any coiling is going to occur pretty far away from your body. And the cable "coiling up" sounds like a bad thing at first, until you see HOW it is coiling up. This cable has a tendency to coil up into the shape it was originally packaged in. So if you put the headphones away somewhere, you can rest assured knowing the cable will VERY EASILY arrange itself back into a very space efficient form factor. This is a pro to me, because I do not have a dedicated microphone. So I will often switch between headphones when using my computer. Additionally, you will know the cable is also SAFE in these conditions. I have broken many headphones over the years because I have poorly maintained the cable. This cable going into the exact arrangement I need when I wish to store it somewhere, with very little effort on my part, is a godsend and I am totally cool with that.<br/><br/>Now that these two are out of the way, let's move into some more pros. The sound is great. I'm not an audiophile, so I have no opinion on how "chocolatey" the mids are or how "minty" the treble is, or whatever buzzwords those people like to use to describe their sound equipment. But what I can tell you is, the sound is very clear and crisp and you will no doubt pick up on details in music that you never heard before, especially if you've spent your whole life using substandard, cheap headphones or "gaming" headsets. I play a digital piano through my DAW software, and immediately I could tell a massive difference in not just the overall quality, but also the clarity in the finer details of the various piano libraries I had been using for months --- details I previously did not even know were there. And this is straight, out of box performance. No EQ, not even hooked into an audio interface. Just plugging right into a line output on my computer case.<br/><br/>So, how about audio clarity in a noisy environment?<br/>In my opinion, ambient background noises are only SLIGHTLY easier to hear through these, than my usual pair of closed-back headphones. I have a fan in my room that I run pretty much all the time on the lowest setting. Even with my usual pair of closed-back headphones, I can hear the fan. The only time I can't is if I barrage my ears with a constant stream of very loud noises. The same exact case applies with these headphones. If the sound is loud enough you will be completely tuned out to any external noises. I don't even need them that loud to reach a point that they overpower the sound of my whirring fan.<br/><br/>Are there any cons I can think of? Not really. I guess they aren't quite as bassy as my usual headphones could get, but I prefer that. Sometimes stuff would just sound so...mixed up and muddied on my other headphones, and that was all due to their closed design. I'm sure someone with vastly superior background in audio equipment can find something to dislike about these headphones, but I'm a simple man. As that kind of person, I really can not find anything to dislike about these headphones. So far they have been a blast and I am loving them. If you are a relatively simple person too, and you just want to get something better than whatever dollar store headphones you've been using for years, these will definitely be good value to you. I will not be giving any rating towards "Noise Cancellation", because these are not noise cancelling headphones. Why that is even something I can rate on these doesn't really make any sense to me.

I admit, I am an absolute sound snob. I am so picky it isn't funny. But these headphones... they check ALL the boxes.<br/><br/>I knew I would be happy, Audio-Technica is such a respected name, but it goes beyond my expectations.<br/><br/>To start, I don't go for bass heavy headphones. I prefer studio quality to hear all the sounds. Heavy bass cancels out some of the mid range.  So if your expecting ground shaking (or, I guess, ear shaking) bass, never buy studio quality. I simply use an equalizer on my computer to pop up the bass a bit (you should always use an equalizer or you miss out) . I listen to a lot of darkwave and aggrotech so you need a bit of bass on that.<br/><br/>However, I did my first test in Valheim. My computer decided it was going to be a pain and not use my headset mic, regardless of what I told it, instead use my MXL condenser. Well, it is a good mic. Instead of fighting it, I just pushed my headset mic out of the way... and it would just get in my way (mostly sit right in front of my left eye), so it was time for headphones instead of a headset. My headset has some pretty good surround sound, so I knew what to listen for. But wow! Just on the game loading screen I was hearing sound effects I never noticed before.<br/><br/>Once in game I was hearing what I can only think is the way the sound team intended the game to sound like. Footsteps sounded real now, birds I never noticed before, all the little chirps, wind, chittering of the MOBs, all totally more realistic.<br/><br/>Tested the surround by hunting for some deer, and it exceeded expectations there too. I could accurately track the sounds of deer: right rear, left front, dead left, moving, I could hear the sounds moving naturally (which my headset did too, but the cans have a more vibrant sound).<br/><br/>Then I loaded Spotify and put on a song by a band I've seen many times live. Now that.. was gorgeous as well. It sounded natural, like I was there live, hearing all the nuance and all the sound.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the huge bass isn't there, that's okay with me. The bass is very solid, not disappointing me at all. The human voice should not sound flat, and I was totally hearing all the range in the vocals. Just like being there. But the bass is good. I really love the bass I'm getting out of it (listening to some darkwave right now, so it's really got bass, I'm not disappointed).<br/><br/>As for noise cancelling.... well, they are open back. That being said, I actually didn't hear much outside noise while playing music. And while in game, I pretended not to so to drive my kids crazy (it's a mother's job to driver her kids crazy). But yes, in game I heard outside noise pretty well. In my situation, though, it's not a big deal. I have a fairly quiet office space where I play, and well, when I'm in the living room, being able to hear outside noises is usually good, I'm down there to be around the fam, after all.<br/><br/>But if you want no outside noise, I recommend a closed back headphone. As I mentioned, when the music was on, I wasn't hearing much, even when the kids started talking. They could hear my music pretty well, but I couldn't really hear them.<br/><br/>The comfort level... that too is great. I was hesitant of the way the headband was designed. However, it fits great. I got spoiled by self adjusting headbands as it always seems I can't find the right click on other ones. This one self adjusted perfectly.<br/><br/>At first it felt loose, I shook my head quite a bit and they stayed perfectly in place. The ear pieces fit well over the ear, I put on my glasses and they felt great with the glasses on. The "looseness" really seems to help with not feeling squished while wearing glasses. I've been wearing them for a couple hours now (once headphones on, its hard to get them off of me) and it's not hot and sticky, still feel comfortable, and I don't feel like my head is in a vice. I could totally wear them all day if I had to.<br/><br/>I would totally, 100%, recommend these headphones for anyone who want quality sound. Of course I'm a person who thinks ear buds should be outlawed on the basis they deliver inferior sound (I told you I am sound snob).<br/><br/>They are ..<br/><br/>worth.<br/><br/>every.<br/><br/>penny.<br/><br/>Totally worth it.

I purchased this for games, movies and general use. I will be using these at home for my PC pretty much exclusively.<br/><br/>I did a lot of research to find what would be the best headphone at the best price for my own personal needs, and this is what I wound up picking.<br/><br/>These are open backed headphones which have a large soundstage and accurate sound. They will leak noise because that's what open backs do, but in return they will give you a great soundstage and will also sound more like speakers rather than sound being pumped directly into your head. This was important to me because I plan on using them for long sessions, and did now want fatigue from listening. I also, although I'm not certain if it's medically true, believe that it's better for your hearing not to have that sound pumped right into your head and isolated. You still shouldn't put sound too high, but this helps.<br/><br/>The headphones are extremely comfortable. It doesn't really say it, but they are indeed circumaural, they fit around your ears. Your ears might very slightly touch the outer edge of the pads, but you won't really notice it and it's a good fit.<br/><br/>The fit is also in general very nice. You don't need to adjust anything, you just put it on and it automatically rests on your head. Now you may have read that these will fall off your head if you have a smaller head. I do not think this is the case if you simply aren't gyrating and slamming your head around. If you are someone that spazzes around while having headphones on, I can see that it might fall off. I would assume lots of headphones would fall off. When I run with headphones on they fall off too, even if they're very secure regularly. However when I am listening I generally make only small regular motions with my head, and it's secure. It's comfortable. There isn't pressure, but for me that's a positive. I don't like pressure on my head, because then it starts to hurt after awhile and you certainly are very aware you're wearing headphones. With the way it is, while you know they're there, you don't feel them there really and can just be immersed in whatever it is you're doing.<br/><br/>The materials on the earpads are very nice. They're soft cloth, not leather or pleather or anything like that.<br/><br/>To me comfort and ease of putting it on were huge factors, as well as the soundstage and accuracy. If they are for you as well, maybe these will be good for you too.<br/><br/>There are multiple models for this. They are fairly similar, pretty much identical outside of max input power. Now depending on your level of audiophileness, that may or may not matter to you. For me these are more than good enough. I doubt I will ever try the higher end models, as I don't even actually know what input power would do. The impedence is low enough that I don't need an amp, in fact it's very similar to any other cheap headphone in terms of power needed to drive it. Except the quality is much higher.<br/><br/>The sound quality will really strike you. I have equalizer inputs and surround sound off of my soundcard. With proper equalizer you can pretty much adjust any headphone to what you want really. However, these are so accurate and already so good I don't see the point for that. Also surround side is completely unnecessary with this soundstage, it's really just a gimmick that I'd suggest passing on for headphones in general. With the proper speaker setup surround sound can be great, but for mere headphones it's kind of a gimmick.<br/><br/>These drivers are very large. 53mm, and for a good price too. I was amazed at the sounds I was catching that I wasn't before. With proper equalizer and cheap headphones you can get to a certain level, but I noticed this went beyond that, and fiddling around it was clear where the sound was artificial with the equalizer and surround sound. I could hear signs swinging in games, windmills turning. I'd look around and I'd see these things that I don't remember noticing before like that.<br/><br/>I know after a week or so the sound will be even better. But right now I'm already happy and think it's 5 star.<br/><br/>Now a quick note on sound cards: if you have a mid or upper tier motherboard you probably have about as good sound or better than a cheap dedicated soundcard. The Asus Xonar is a popular card at a cheap price, but I don't think you need to actually get it if your onboard is good. My onboard can actually sample higher than that card and besides that the specs are quite similar. Chances are yours are too if you care enough to pay this much for a good pair of headphones.<br/><br/>If you need a mic you're better off getting a stand alone mic too. But since I play single player games there's really no need.<br/><br/>Mostly I wanted something comfortable, with accurate sound and good soundstage, that wouldn't get too hot because they're closed. These might get a little hot after very long periods of time, but it's going to be less than pretty much anything other than the ear bud or internal around the ear type styles, which are all going to have much worse sound and also will be putting sound directly into your ears which I don't really like, and certainly won't give you much in the way of soundstage as a result.<br/><br/>I don't write too many reviews, but I liked this so much that I really wanted to, and I hope it helps someone else out. If the price drops even more I'd say to really jump on it. I got mine for just under $100 and am happy with that price. The other set that I was really considering were the AKG K 240 Studios at around $68. But those are semi-open, with higher impedance and much smaller drivers. I think these are better for my purposes. Also, I got mine from Beach Camera, who were super quick on shipping. Whereas when I tried getting the AKGs the seller hadn't shipped it for several days. In retrospect I am very happy they lagged so much, as these are far better and worth the extra money.

These headphones are fantastic. I got the 500x model. This might be kinda long so buckle up..<br/><br/>First off,<br/><br/>Sound Quality:<br/>The one thing I heard the most in nearly every single review and unboxing etc etc I could find about these (which was a lot, I researched for a few days) is that the bass is very low so "if you're a bass head they're not for you". This is simply not true. The bass is just fine. It is very slightly light on the lowest end of the spectrum but that's only because of the open back letting out some of the rumble. I have an equalizer program (DFX) where I even set the high mids and full high ends up for FPS games (which is why I got these) and the bass is still very present. So yeah myth busted I guess.<br/><br/>Next thing to note is how crystal clear the sound is. It's a beautiful thing. Music sounds so crisp and all the layers are presented very very well. The highs can be a little too high if there are any shrill noises in what you're listening to. But they never distort in any of the tests I've given them.<br/><br/>Next, positional audio or the sound stage is absolutely legendary. Like I said I bought these primarily to use for combat games (CS:GO, Fortnite, Paladins, etc) where hearing the enemy is very important. These headphones are practically cheating. The direction of sound is so clear that I get confused by all the clearly separate directions the sounds come from. It will take getting used to hearing the in game sounds as if my ears are actually in the game. In fact it's so realistic that I have turned my head to look at the sound multiple times now because I thought someone was actually behind me. It's fantastic.<br/><br/>As for sound leakage, it's not too bad. If whatever you're listening to is very loud it can be heard from a few feet away. But any medium volume stuff can only be heard if somone is directly next to you. High tones tend to be louder in general for these and those always carry more than low tones so usually that is all people will hear if they're nearby. And then for sound coming into the headphones, when nothing is playing you can hear your surroundings just as well as you could wearing no headphones at all. When something is playing though it almost entirely blocks outside noise. It would have to be pretty dang loud around you to be able to drown out whatever you're listening to. But still I probably wouldn't recommend these as ideal for public transportation, classrooms, libraries, or other quiet environments where it might bother people.<br/><br/>Build Quality/Comfort:<br/><br/>These are extremely comfortable. The cloth covered memory foam pads are great. They still get a little warm even though they are so breathable but my head runs pretty hot so I don't think the pads are to blame.<br/>The clamping force is very minimal and fairly evenly distributed around the pads. Slightly more pressure on the bottom under the ear which isn't exactly pleasant but it's not bad enough to care. Just worth noting. Also people said that their ears pressed against the drivers inside the cups and they must have huge ears because mine are pretty big and there's plenty of space in there for me. I have a fairly large head so the pads create a good seal around my ears. I dunno if a smaller noggin would have any issues with the cups laying flush since they don't move at all. I know one of the reviewers I saw had a complaint about that.<br/>Oh and the wings or head flap adjuster things. I was worried a bit that I might hate them and it almost prevented me from even trying them out. But they're awesome. Not having pressure on the crown of my head feels so nice. These things are easy to almost forget about.<br/><br/>As for the build quality, they seem very sturdy. Not like super rugged but they could take a few drops and some bending and twisting and still be perfectly fine. The top bars creak a little if you squeeze them together but never during normal use. The metal mesh looks cool to me and feels nice and sturdy. The cord is thick and feels like it would take a few years worth of normal bending to put a kink in it, and it doesn't feel like normal rubber wire wraps that will fray. It does want to stay coiled a bit like it comes in the package but stretching it into a straight line for a few hours has already made a difference.<br/><br/>The only part that feels moderately weak are the flaps. But they're not flimsy. Just weaker than the rest of the headphones.<br/><br/>So, yeah. I think that's all the stuff.<br/><br/>TL:DR they're effin amazing. Buy them!

But are far larger than I had imagined, though I probably should have looked at the description more closely. These are larger than the closed ear headphones I have from the same brand. They sound great though and let outside sound in when desired. I can wear them for longer periods of time than the closed ear ones.<br/><br/>I still may search for a quality open ear that isn't so physically large though.

If you're looking for a good pair of open back headphones with great sound quality and volume i would highly recommend buying these I've never owned a pair of audio technicas but i've always heard great things about them and these headphones definitely deliver however if you are plannning to use these to listen to music or play games or watch movies basically anything that would require wearing them for a long period of time and like me you don't have a very large head you might want to invest in bigger ear cushions to prevent them from hanging/sliding off your ears or just go the route i did and cable tie the two wings together but overall 10/10 headphones highley recommend picking up a pair if you're in the market for a pair of good studio headphones!

I'm not an audiophile, but could be considered an Audio enthusiast.  I regularly enjoy DTS from Blu-rays or discreet listening on a FiiO X1 (my library is entirely FLAC). My 'computer speakers' are a pair of DefTech bookshelf driven by a Denon.<br/><br/>I stumbled upon these headphones during my search for a gaming headset. I had not planned to spend much on a headset, given I don't use it often. I was primarily interested in something more comfortable with less brittle treble than the stock xbox headset. Without first auditioning, I decided to take a chance on the Audio Technica ATH-AD500X, rigging it with a separate mic and Sennheiser PCV 05 Combo Audio Adapter.<br/><br/>Music:<br/>Compared to the common &amp; popular closed types, open back headphones are an entirely different listening tool, for an entirely different type of experience. Exposure to the openness of the sound stage has changed me in a permanent way, I just cannot go back to closed (except for active noise cancelling which are designed for that specific purpose). I'm rediscovering my music library with new details and nuances revealed.  An advantage of open headphones is there's no 'booming' which may fatigue the ears during long listening sessions. It took me a few hours to acclimate to the lack of overpowering bass that I'm accustomed to. I'll admit, that I heavily boost the lower frequencies on the FiiO's equalizer, sculpting the sound to meet my preference. Doing so may make the sound 'innacurate', but I don't care...i'm in awe--for sound is just about as personal and subjective as it can get. When I listen to Bach's Cello Suite No.1, I like to *feel* the bass resonate with my core. Some favorite benchmarks include Enigma's "Mea Culpa" executed with clean-deep bass, or the drums vigor of AC/DC's "Thunderstuck". I can sense the transition of the drums in Cranberrie's "Dreams". I'm able to detect more details from "Amadeus" and "Bram Stroker's Dracula" soundtracks. These cans have an aptitude for vocals. Any tracks from Bocelli's "Romanza" or Carey's "Daydream" will shine. I somehow felt closer to Bowie in "Heroes" (original and Live in Berlin 2002).<br/><br/>Gaming:<br/>When connected directly to my XB1 controller the bass is sufficient, not anemic nor overbearing/fatiguing. I find myself flinching to the vivid screams of enemies sneaking up behind me in Borderlands 2. At times I struggle to determine whether a sound is from the game or from within the living room. I've read that some improve their game because they can pinpoint the footsteps of opponents. Everything is very 'open' on these headphones, it cannot be adequately described in words or with fancy detailed sound graphs--it must be experienced first hand.<br/><br/>Quality &amp; Comfort:<br/>I'm picky and uncompromising when it comes to the bands. (I had a negative experience in the past with an HD280 Pro band cracking &amp; falling apart in less than a year despite gentle usage). The ATH-AD500X band is a durable and light-weight design. Some people find the 3D Wings design awkward or uncomfortable, fortunately for me they work great for my average size head. The wings are a unique design, the actual band never touches your head. The fabric pads are comfortable and properly fit around my ears. I've read that some people use different pads from other manufacturers, something I may try out in the future. The cable appears sturdy (I would have preferred a removable cord design to swap with a shorter one).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>If you're looking for a great overall open-back headphone, this is an excellent entry point at a great value. The price point makes it relatively low risk if you cannot audition them first. I've read that competitors in this class are either too tight/uncomfortable, or too bright in the highs, or clarity masked by a veil.  This is not designed for the typical bass-head, instead you may discover new details in a very open sound stage. I'm confident that a quality amp with some equalizer adjustments could drive the AD500X to meet most of my bass needs. It's a different kind of bass--different kind of experience I highly recommend.<br/><br/>Additional Comments:<br/><br/>Open ear headphones are not designed or intended for noisy environments. These don't block out any sound, they perform best in a quiet environment. Also, there's significant sound leakage so it may disturb others around you.<br/><br/>These cans are easy to drive without an amp. However many recommend the use of an amp to bring out the best performance. My next upgrade will be something from FiiO or more likely the Magni 2.<br/><br/>If I were going to upgrade, I would jump straight to the AD1000X. The AudioTechnica flagships are manufactured in Japan and constructed of premium materials. However at that pricepoint, other options like the Philips x2 Fidelio or venturing into Planars from HIFIMAN become attractive. The planars may require some amplification to be enjoyable.<br/><br/>There's conflicting viewpoints regarding the 'burn in' of headphones. I put mine through 3 days of shuffle play at normal listening volume prior to using.<br/><br/>Update 12/05/2018:<br/>These headphones are still holding up quite nicely, I use them more frequently for gaming and discreet listening of FLAC files. I also replaced the earpads with Brainwavz Hybrid Memory Foam Earpad - Black PU/Velour, making them even more comfortable.

The sound: Buy these! Light and airy, amazing soundstage and detail. Great for orchestral and soundtracks but only at a reasonable volume. They start to distort and sound piercing if you drive them too hard. For light and easy listening, these are great.<br/><br/>The fit: Think twice. They are light as a feather - which is great, but the cups don't swivel and the "wings" do not provide enough support. Out of the box they were too big for my head. I had to bend the wire bands and add foam padding to the wings to keep them from sagging down past my ears. After an hour of adjustments they now fit pretty well, but only on my head and no one else's.

So... many details in songs that I had previously not heard became audible. The clarity is amazing.<br/>"metamorphosis" by Jean Luc Ponty ... is the latest where I heard notes.... individual notes... from a different instrument, I have never heard before. I have listened to that song on my FIIO flac player, on the original CD on my dynaudio home stereo,  and don't recall hearing those notes... on the intro. very polyrythmic intro on that. So ... I heard this other.... instrument in the midrange.... that was doing a polyrhythm and I was like... what's that?<br/>Ditto for Ska... I used to dislike the midrange on "mirror in the bathroom" by the english beat. The sax just blared out of the mids on my home system ( dynaudio mids ).... I actually changed the crossover circuit to increase the resistance by 3 ohms... so as to reduce that loud blaring.... on these headphones its perfectly flat and great.<br/>So I'm like... oh oh, gotta go work on the crossover circuits again.<br/>Great....<br/>if you have a large head...<br/>like size 7 hat....<br/>seems perfect for a sie 8 head<br/>but the brackets that hold it are quite comfortable,<br/><br/>Overall superb sound, excellent... needs to be dialed in or EQ to your tastes. Yes they are large... too large... and my head is XXL and even them they are a smidge too large.<br/>So if you've got a big head... and "big ears"... these are a winner.  Not for small heads certainly.<br/>I do hope the build quality lasts.<br/>Have had only for 2 months.

I didn't get this for X-Mas and Santa Claus did not deliver one to me. However, this is an amazing item that would be just as great as something I would imagine to be delivered directly by Santa Claus! It's expensive, but I feel like the build quality is there as long as I take care of it. I prefer the dual ear pads for business usage instead of those other models with just one ear pad. The weight of the entire headset is pretty light, maybe not as light as a single-sided ear pad headset but it's not heavy compared to one of those serious music over-the-ear style headphones. I would not wear this to the gym to workout, because I feel these might not hold tight enough against the head while you jog on the treadmill.<br/><br/>Was able to connect the headset to both my PC and iPhone, however, I initially had trouble finding a way to switch between the two devices. I contacted their support team by phone and was able to get a hold of a team member. He explained that the company is still working on the latest version of the software. He advised that I download version 1.0 from and install that instead. Once I installed it, I was able to navigate to the "Bluetooth" section to Disconnect or Connect the device depending on what I wanted. It's a decent workaround while they work on the existing latest version of the software for iOS Bluetooth and PC USB connectivity.<br/><br/>Battery life has been pretty fantastic so far, but I have used it only for a few days. Today was not too busy for me so I spoke using the headphones for a couple hours only. Left it uncharged all day (10+ hours) and when I pressed on the button to check battery life the digital voice said, "battery full". Not sure if this power status is true or not, but I guess I could leave it unplugged for a couple days to test? I'll leave it unplug for another day or so and if it still does not drain any batter then the digital voice status generated by the headset might be wrong.<br/><br/>The headset feels comfortable wearing it for several hours at a time. I do feel a little warm around the ears after two hours straight, but nothing major (expected). It's a work headphone so I have not tested music or game. I have Sony headphones for those other types of activities.<br/><br/>The mic is pretty awesome, it is clear and people have no issues hearing me. The background noise is held to a minimum. The boom mic is slick and swivels up and down, and you can wear it either side of the ear. It has a magnet that clamps to the top of the headset if you are not using it. SUPPOSEDLY you can mute the mic if you swivel the mic boom to the top....? I haven't tested it, but I don't care. It would be a bonus, but not important to me. I mute the mic by software or by pressing on the "down" volume button on the headset for a 1 or 2 seconds. The mute button on the headset works when you are on an active call, but it does not seem to mute if there is no active call going on.<br/><br/>The busy light signal on the side where the mic boom is located turns on occasionally? I thought it only worked with Bluetooth, but one time I saw it light up when I just completed a call from PC USB connection to my VOIP system. Not sure why it was lit up, but I disabled it because it feels a bit gimmicky. I don't expect people to actually "know" that I'm on the call just by seeing the red circle light up. It's not bad though, I don't have any negative opinions about it.<br/><br/>The USB to Micro USB cable that comes with it is long enough for me to connect and use with my PC. It's not super lengthy (slightly under 5 feet, between 1.2 to 1.5 meters?), but good enough to be used while you are sitting close to your laptop. Just do not expect that you can walk around your desk with the USB cable attached.<br/><br/>One feature request would be to be able to view the battery charge percentage from Jabra Direct software? That would be nice if the headset's digital voice status is not accurate.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe this device is expensive but it does seem to be of high quality material. The sound quality is excellent as far as conversation goes. The ease of connectivity is fantastic. The mute is easy to activate compared to other generic headsets. Highly recommended!<br/><br/>Update (8/05/2019): I am giving this product a 4 stars instead of 5, because I just found out that the headset was down to 5% battery this morning. The software popped up a notification, but when I pressed the button on the right side of the headset the digital voice stated "battery full". I do not agree to be mislead on this information, so minus one star of an otherwise great product. It is still a recommended product, but I hope the battery does not short out in the near future.

I have a home office for my business.  I had a Sennheiser Bluetooth headset, but I junked it because calls would periodically deteriorate with static until I was disconnected.  The Jabra Evolve 65 works flawlessly.  It sits on the ear with a soft pad so it is extremely comfortable for long calls.  It came with a USB receiver I plugged into my Lenovo Thinkpad port replicator.  Consequently, the headset works well with Microsoft Teams and Zoom.  I recommend buying the Jabra Evolve 65 charging stand, it will support your headset and keep it charged.  Only downside is the non-user-removable battery; eventually the headset will probably have to be replaced, but I have no doubt it will last several years.  In sum, it was well worth the investment.  I also have the Jabra in-ear bluetooth headset which I use in the field.  It also works very well.  I have a healthy respect now for Jabra quality and design.

Note that I'm using this mostly with Webex on a Win. 10 PC and via Bluetooth vs. the dongle that came with the device.<br/>Pros:<br/>Sound quality is great, both incoming and outgoing<br/>Pairing with my Windows 10 PC via built-in Bluetooth was easy<br/>Mute function works for me however Webex doesn't always detect (see below)<br/>Minor Cons:<br/>"Busy light" does not work for me at all - and when I turn it off manually, it comes back on by itself. Probably has to do with other apps that have access to the headset in the background.<br/>Also when I'm _not_ on a meeting and computer audio is not playing, headset makes 'bloodleoop' noises every min. or so - have no idea what this is supposed to indicate<br/>RE: mute function, the Webex setting to 'Sync mute button status on microphone device' does not always work. I've had experience where Webex says I'm not muted but headset says its muted. Be cautious :-)

I had to buy a second one. I do all my work from the coffee shop and am frequently attending meetings online. I tried all type of high end ear buds and headsets, looking for one with the best noise cancellation mics so those on the other end will not hear any noise. This Jabra is by far the best for that purpose.<br/><br/>The headset does not fit tight so I frequently have to adjust it, and I still hear some background noise. But as far as those I am meeting with are concerned, I am coming across loud and clear even though music and noise from the coffee shop is all around me.<br/><br/>Also, after about 1 year of use, the handle just broke! But I still went out to buy the same Jabra, because I still work out of the coffee shop!

Sound quality is fine for a VOIP headset. Voices are a robotic but come through clearly. For media, the sound isn't great... it'd be fine for background music, but isn't great for more focused listening as the quality is so so.<br/>Comfort drops off after prolonged use; if you're on one call and then off and can take the headset off it's not bad, but it gets a little uncomfortable after more than an hour or two.<br/>The Mic works great for Teams and calls via my cell, however Google meetings has very low volume with it.<br/>The battery life isn't bad. Not as impressive as I'd expected, but last the day on heavy use or a couple on lighter use.<br/>Build quality is light but seems a little flimsy, so issues so far but I'm just a week into using it.<br/>BT connectivity and range is good.<br/>Overall I don't feel it's a great value at one fitty US; I've had lower priced headsets with better comfort and performance, but we'll see how it holds up.
----
I use the for MS Teams at the same time I’m linked through BT to my cell phone. It works exceptionally well. Earbuds from iPhone hurt my ears after several days/weeks of usage. These don’t and the sounds quality is fantastic. Very happy with my purchase.
----
Read the directions you have to hold the Bluetooth button for 3 seconds to connect. I only say this because so many reviews say they can not connect.. my only complaint is they are a bit loose on my head and fall off if I bend over to pick something up.
----
The sound quality, light weight and noise cancellation and can wear for longer period are good part of headphone and I liked all these features. One thing I didn’t like is not easy to connect charging cable to headphone and charging cable pin pin does not go easily , otherwise everything is good
----
So damn close to perfect for a wfh world. The teams connection is awesome. It pairs effortlessly to my laptop and iPad and sawps between easily. If only I could make it a bit tighter. You can't be super animated with your head jestures. It will fall off.
----
I had been wanting wireless headset so I could move about and not worry about pulling my computer off the shelf. I am so glad I took the plunge! I can make a quick trip to the kitchen or another room without losing connection allowing me to prep a meal, get a drink or put things up when I'm in a meeting without a presentation. It has also helped me get in some steps. I like that it can be used with ans ANT drive or Bluetooth so I am also able to use on a cell phone if I want. Only downside is the mic has to be right un front of my mouth to be clear.

My road to the Sennheiser HD 600's has been a little long and filled with some interesting twists and turns that have, or so I hope, led me to a better understanding of what are a great set of headphones.  Naturally it is very typical to wish to compare these to other headphones.  After all, isn't that how we so often make purchasing decisions?  We try differing products until we find the one which works best/right for our needs.  So my review is going to work on two fronts:  a review of the product itself, and a review against some competitors I have acquired in the last year in my quest to find headphones that are right for me.  And hopefully for you.<br/><br/>Regarding the HD600's themselves I have mostly nothing but excellent news to report.  Personally, I like the way they look.  The mottled black and blue coloring is different, but not garish in any way.  The large and deep oval ear cups are precisely what one wants for an over-the-ear design.  At 6'4" I'm certainly sporting a larger head than the average male and fortunately for me my entire ears fit comfortably inside the ear cups.  My ears do not touch the protective cloth over the drivers, but the outer edge of my ear does touch at places around the inside of the ear cup.  This is a minor annoyance and goes unnoticed some of the time. Those of you more average of height and head size will likely never have this issue.  The ear cups themselves are very comfortable, seal well to my head and do not get hot even after a good number of hours of use.  This also means the head clamping  force is perfect for me; I never feel like my head is being squeezed.  Everything about the headphones seems to indicate they are well-made, but I cannot help but feel the plastic seems a bit thin.  Maybe cheap even.  They do not creak and nothing flexes, but it's the only part which lets me down at all about the headphones.<br/><br/>The included box, while awesome for storage, is clearly not oriented for travel.  But I would argue these aren't portable headphones meant for the on-the-go user.  They do not fold up.  The ear cups do not turn to lay flat.  And considering the amplification needed to properly drive these, using a typical portable music player (your cell phone, iPod, etc.) isn't ideal anyway.<br/><br/>Now for what I consider to be the more important part of how I came to select the HD600: research and listening.  Let's first be clear about something... audio equipment is not unlike some other equipment markets in that you often spend exponentially more money for an item just to gain minor, incremental increases in some important criteria.  To you speaker X sounds better than speaker Y, all other things being equal.  It's likely speaker X costs more.  Most of the time it will cost more, but not all of the time.  But how much more does it cost and how much more quality of sound are you receiving for that additional cost?  It's almost always a matter of diminishing returns... loads more money for a bit firmer bass or slightly clearer treble.  But this is the nirvana for which we seek in audio equipment.<br/><br/>Over the last year I purchased two other sets of headphones:  Grado 80e and Sennheiser Momentum.  Clearly the Grado's at $100 are the least expensive with the Momentum jumping up markedly to $299, while the more recently acquired Sennheiser HD600 hit the $400 mark.  Comparing my first two purchases, the 80e's and Momentum's, the differences were pretty straight-forwarded.  To me the Grado's sounded brighter with good bass and sligthly harsh mids ("smeared" is the word which came to mind as I compared them in listening tests at home).  The Mometum's sounded more laid back (not as bright) with great bass (that could be a bit smeared itself in the upper bass) and definitely superior mids (thinking men's voices here - became painfully obvious will using a live track from Morrissey between the two headphones).  And so it was I came to find myself using each pair for different purposes.<br/><br/>The Grado 80e's became my preferred can for classical music (a genre into which I am becoming more deeply involved of late) as I felt, for my personal preferences, the brighter qualities enhanced the instruments typical of classical music, while the bass was more than sufficient.  But when I wanted to rock (or alternative as is more often the case) I broke out the Momentum's.  The accentuated, but not overblown bass, was quite welcome and I noticed less the laid back nature of the treble, especially as I used them more and more.<br/><br/>But with the also recent purchase of some better home audio equipment (Marantz CD6005 CD player and a SoundEngine D1 DAC/Headphone amp for my computer - listening to ALAC encoded tracks) I found myself thinking both the Momentum and 80e were somehow lacking.  That I wasn't getting everything I could from my music via this better equipment.<br/><br/>From all the research I had done previously I elected to spend the money and purchase the HD600.  I don't think I have found a single bad review out there in the Internet sphere.  A few have thought them a little warm or laid back.  But most every review hits upon how, and especially for the money, the HD600s hit all the right notes (sorry).  Having had them burned in for 30-hours the listening tests began.  I had considered this purchase principally for classical music.  I really didn't think I'd get more from them for rock/alternative than I was already getting from the Momentums and so it was the classical CDs came out and I plugged into the CD player.  I also plugged in the Grados to the Marantz A/V receiver, direct mode engaged.  Adjusting for volume as best I could (this is hardly scientific) I played a handful of very familiar tracks from very familiar CDs; swapping back and forth between the HD600s and Grado 80e.<br/><br/>It too almost no time to hear the difference.  I'll concede that it's sometimes difficult to put into words the differences heard, but I'll try.  The first thing I noticed were the violins.  When a number of them are playing notes together the Grado's sounded smeared compared to the HD600s.  Not unlike a poorly created JPEG from a digital point-n-shoot versus a well-made JPEG from an original RAW processed via Adobe Lightroom.  Details are are lost in the former, but the latter does a far superior job of keeping the detail even in the process of losing information.  The HD600 left me feeling like I was actually sitting there in the room with the musicians.  I'm not referring to placement of the instruments (the HD600 do a good job, but I've read reviews for other cans that do better), but simply how clear, precise, concise and live-sounding are the violins.  Actually, it was true of all the stringed instruments.  The resonance of the strings... their very clear nature... was a welcome and astonishing difference.<br/><br/>Granted, the Grado's are one-quarter the cost and I shouldn't be surprised the HD600's sounded better.  Markedly better.  And I didn't have to listen long or hard to notice the differences.  They are obvious; not subtle.  That said, I can't say I was every displeased with the Grado's.  It was only in comparison to the HD600's that it became possible to hear and understand the Grado's limitations.<br/><br/>And like the stringed instruments, voices also became sharper, clearer, more focused.  I had found what I was looking for regarding my classical music interests: a pair of headphones that while generally neutral (which some would consider to be 'flat' and flat has, I think, a negative connotation), are not at all boring or flat.  I feel the music is more alive than ever in comparison to the Grado's.<br/><br/>So... I also broke out some rock and alternative music (the recently remastered Led Zeppelin discs, some Nine Inch Nails and Pet Shop Boys) to see what the HD600's could do.  Here I feared the Momentum would just kick butt thanks to the fuller bass, but I must say the HD600's continued to impress.  All the good things they brought to mid and higher frequencies (clarity, precision) were still present, but, surprisingly, the bass was rock solid as well. I may hate myself for saying it, but I think the bass was a bit better.  The upper-bass bloat in the Momentum's doesn't appear on the HD600's, which tends to make the lower-bass stand out more because they aren't overwhelmed by the enhanced upper-bass.  I'd still say the Momentum's have more punch and who doesn't like that when listening to rock or alternative, but I could find myself readily using the HD600's just as often for The Smiths, The Cure, Skinny Puppy, etc. as I would the Momentum's.<br/><br/>And here I think I have found a most excellent trio of headphones.  Finding one perfect pair of headphones for all needs and opportunities is probably impossible.  But I think I have accidentally stumbled upon a most excellent hat trick of cans that meet my various needs.  I like to listen to music when I'm on the go; I have needs for portability.  And while not truly the most portable of headphones, the Grado's for classical (and still quite reasonable for rock and alternative) and the Momentum's for rock and alternative (I confess I don't like them as much for classical as I do the Grado's for rock and alternative), AND the HD600's for more critical, at-home listening with audio equipment that has enough amplifier ooomph to properly push them.<br/><br/>Add my name and voice to the long list of of folks who think, dollar for dollar, the Sennheiser HD600 are the best value in headphones out there.

It's easy to forget that, next year, the HD 600 will turn 20 years old. Admittedly, audio transducers have a funny way of sticking around longer than just about any other piece of electronics equipment. A line of speakers will, usually, be in production for at least several years. Even when they've been replaced, they usually aren't even close to obsolete, because even mid-fi has gotten pretty far into diminishing returns. But, even in this alternate timeline of audiophile-dom (others might call it an alternate reality, an insane asylum...) the HD 600s are freakin ancient. I can only think of a few other cans with this kind of longevity:<br/><br/>The Sony MDR-V6; so old that it still has "for DIGITAL" emblazoned on the side. A quick trip through audio theory will reveal that this is meaningless, but in 1985 it sounded really cool.<br/><br/>The Beyerdynamic DT770/880/990; so old that they still have shag carpet earpads.<br/><br/>Various Grados; so old that it's too late for anybody to admit they sound like trash. Instead, they just mumble something about "sparkle" and then go buy something else.<br/><br/>And yet, 20 years later, the HD600 is still the headphone that, within headphone circles, everybody talks about and everybody has heard. There's a reason for that: it's not just really good. Purely on the strength of its sound, it stands out as excellent. When price is considered? It might just be the best headphone in the world.<br/><br/>THE SOUND:<br/>Inevitably, whenever anyone tries to talk about the HD600 or the HD650, someone brings up the "Sennheiser Veil." This so-called veil was a kind of muffling of the sound, and the people who complain about it would have you believe that the HD6XX sounds like Apple Earpods.<br/><br/>I cannot state emphatically enough how much the veil does not exist. It is either a product of the imagination of people who wish the AKG K701 was a bit brighter, or the result of people trying to plug the HD6XX straight into an inadequate source, i.e. most phones, MP3 players, iPods, laptops, etc. They need an amp. More on that later. At any rate, these headphones are as veiled as Eva Green in The Dreamers. You. Will. See. erm, Hear. Everything.<br/><br/>That's both a blessing and a curse. Lesser headphones - even my Sony MDR-V6s, for instance - can mask the flaws in a bad recording. All of those 128kbps MP3s you've pirated because you're a bad person? They're gonna sound awful. If your father-in-law-to-be hands sends you some recordings of his garage band, grab however awful a set of backup cans you need for it to sound good. Because these will tell you the truth. Yet, to a good recording, they are shockingly flattering. If you put garbage in, you'll get garbage out. Give it something good, though, and you'll get magic. I've listened to just about my entire music library with these, and there are a few recordings in particular that really demonstrate how well these shine:<br/><br/>-In the Air Tonight (Phil Collins, Face Value, 1981): On a decent-to-good set of headphones, this song sounds ominous; it sounds cool. Whatever. On the HD600s, it's a religious experience. Sounds swirl around your head. The crescendos and diminuendos blow you away. The vocals sound perfect. Incredible.<br/><br/>-In Your Eyes (Peter Gabriel, So, 1986): The entire album is fabulous. Listen to it over and over again. But there's a reason this song is singled out. It's a sibilance nightmare. On my MDR-V6s, it's unlistenable above a moderate volume. Enter the HD600s: there's no hiding how much sibilance there is, but they handle it as gracefully as possible.<br/><br/>Enough ink has been spilled over how these handle classical and jazz (spoiler: fabulously), and their vocal presentation in particular is spot-on.<br/><br/>THE STUFF YOU'LL NEED:<br/>To get all of this brilliant sound, you're going to need a few things. First and foremost is an amp. This can get crazy pretty quick, so first let's draw a distinction: solid state vs tubes. The HD600 has a high enough impedance to really get along with OTL amps (ie, most headphone tube amps). This will color the sound somewhat, get hot, be unreliable, need to warm up, etc. If you want to go down this road, you can. There's also a lot of really expensive solid state amps.<br/><br/>Or, you could just get a Schiit Magni or a JDS Objective2, both of which sound... well... about perfect.<br/><br/>Next, you'll need to think about a DAC. Now, a lot of people just assume they'll need one. That may not be the case. If you have a Retina Macbook Pro, for instance, skip it. You'll never hear the difference between it and whatever you get for 150 bucks. Same deal if you're plugging a (good) CD player or receiver or whatever straight into the amp. If your source is something else, like a midrange PC, you'll need to evaluate this yourself. Unfortunately, I can't help you with that.<br/><br/>If you decide you need a DAC, there are a lot of expensive options out there.<br/><br/>Or, you could just get a Schiit Modi or a JDS ODAC, both of which sound... well... about perfect.<br/><br/>(Side lesson: The internet audiophile community fights back and forth all the time about whether the O2/ODAC or the Magni/Modi is the better setup. Realistically, their performance is nearly identical. Buy whichever you think looks better.)<br/><br/>(Another side lesson: You seriously probably don't need to spend a ton of money on DACs and amps. The O2/ODAC was designed by some wacky internet crusader who wanted to prove that the performance of the Benchmark DAC2 and HPA2 could be achieved without spending thousands of dollars. From an engineering perspective, this is obviously possible. If you look into this further, you will still find people who insist that the O2/ODAC doesn't sound as good as significantly more expensive gear. Just remember that these are audiophile crazies, who think they need 192kHz recordings because Nyquist-Shannon doesn't apply to special snowflakes. The two most important things in any digital-to-analog system are the input file and the transducer.)<br/><br/>Finally, you're going to need good recordings. iTunes is sufficient. Vinyl is pretty good (repeat after me: vinyl does not sound better than CD, it is objectively worse, a record will only sound great 25 times, and will be the equal of the CD never). CD is your best bet, particularly those mastered before the "loudness wars" started up in the late 1990s. However, the world isn't perfect; fear not, the Senns still sound good with stuff that has a compressed dynamic range (within reason). Anything beyond the Redbook CD standard is simply a ploy to get you to spend more money for things you can't hear, and that your dog can't either.<br/><br/>SOME REALITIES:<br/>The way that the Senns achieve all this great sound is by being "open-back" headphones. This means that, on the side of the driver opposite your ear, there's just some mesh to protect it from damage. This means that you can't really use these outside a quiet environment, because you'll hear everything around you. It also means that you probably won't want to listen to them in public, because it's really difficult to look cool when everybody knows you're blasting the Bangles.<br/><br/>Also, they're ugly as sin. But they aren't leaving your house, so who cares?<br/><br/>A WORD ABOUT THE HD650:<br/>Released several years after the HD600, the HD650 at first glance looks like an upgrade. That... depends. The HD650 is darker and smoother at the expense of detail. That's all. I prefer its sound signature. But, it usually costs between 75 and 150 dollars more than the HD600, and so it wasn't worth it for me. It probably isn't worth it for you, either.<br/><br/>So, yeah. These headphones sound just about dead neutral, wonderfully crisp, and yet smooth enough that you can listen at high volumes without fatigue. They can usually be had for less than 300 dollars. And for the price, they have no equal. Now we just have to hope that someday the HD800S can be such an easy decision to make.

Well this is the first real pair of headphones I've owned. Previously I wasn't too serious about headphones and had purchased some SOL Republics over-the-ear headphones. There was a customer service guy that recommended them among others like Skullcandy and other sub $150 non-audiophile headphones saying that "All these headphones are pretty good, just don't buy Beats or your just paying for the name". Well at the time I thought the Republics sounded good for music like Rage Against the Machine. But after I purchased some quality NHT Superzero bookshelf speakers for my office I noticed that the headphones were completely missing the higher frequencies. Boosting the Highs on an Equalizer helped but it still had a muddy sound to them. So I decided to try some more serious higher priced headphones and see what happens.<br/><br/>I already had a decent Peachtree Audio Integrated Amp/DAC with headphone amp to test them. So as I sat in front of my bookshelf speakers, I plugged them into the headphone amp. I wasn't that blown away thinking the HD 600s sounded slightly better than my other headphones but certainly not worth the extra $250 Dollars. However I noticed right away details in music that I'd never noticed before. Like clearly hearing the squeaking chair of a producer at the beginning of The WHO's 'Don't get Fooled Again'.  I let them keep playing music and burn themselves in while I did something else for about 4 hours. When I came back the bass response was noticeably better and sound was slightly improved but still felt it was not that great of an improvement.<br/><br/>Then I had an major facepalm moment when I realized I was comparing these headphones to my bookshelf speakers. They sounded so much like them that I didn't even realize that I had the memory of the bookshelves sound in my head and not the other headphones. I had been listening allot to my main speakers and not much to my other headphones so that must be why. Needless to say I was pretty impressed when I realized my error. Kind of hate to admit that they sound a little better than my main speakers. The bookshelfs have a slightly darker sound and have a somewhat boosted bass by default that I don't care for. So then I compared the actual other headphones and as I expected muddy bass, missing highs and mediocre at best sound. The other headphones also had a very noticeable noise floor. On the HD 600s there is absolutely NONE! Any background noise you notice through the headphones is either due to the recording itself or the source your hooking it up to. This is great because you can listen to music at low volumes and still clearly hear the music without fuzzy noise interfering.<br/><br/>I was surprised also that my phone was even able to drive these headphones to a respectable medium volume. I expected the volume to be allot lower considering the 300 Ohms rating. However you need an amp to get loud enough to get the full details of the music and the phones amp doesn't have the separation of instruments like my home headphone amp. The Bass and Treble don't fully emerge until you get to a loud volume and I mean LOUD. These can be fatiguing if you want to hear all the details of the music because I find the volume has to be fairly loud to reach 100% potential. Just listen to these at medium volumes compared to loud volumes and you will be shocked. There is a sweet-spot with these headphones for sure. It is great for easy listening 'classical' music, acoustic with vocals, symphonies, light rock etc. People saying the bass is too light on these have got to be kidding. I use a Peachtree Audio Amp and DAC which is considered to be neutral by many and at louds volumes it can be a little overbearing on bass-heavy songs. At low volumes I'd agree that the bass is a little light but so is the treble. It has a good punch without taking over and overwhelming your ears. Not flat in anyway whatsoever.<br/><br/>Definitely find Open headphones to sound better without the boxed-in sound of a closed headphone. Yes you can't use them in a quiet room when someone is sitting next to you. But what I like is that you can still somewhat hear what is going on around you if you are not listening at too loud of a volume. I'm a mail carrier that cases mail for hours a day before delivering. So at work I can listen to music at low volumes without someone having to throw something at me to get my attention. I much prefer it to closed headphones in situations like these where you are not concerned about critically listening and just want some background music to pass the time. These headphones are also very comfortable and feels like your wearing earmuffs when they are on. My entire ear fits in the headphone without touching the sides of the enclosure, so rarely get soar even after several hours of use. They clamp a bit tight on your head at first but eventually get stretched out and loosen up over time.<br/><br/>Not a fan of the headphone cable that comes with the HD600. After only one week of use and trying to be careful, the headphone signal was cutting out when I flexed the cable. The cable is so thin and cheap and not deserving of these high quality cans. I'm not one of those people that says cable will change the audio quality but it has to at least be built well enough to withstand normal wear and tear. I upgraded to the HD 650 cables which are almost twice as thick and much more respectable. Although it has a 1/4" plug instead of the 3.5mm plug from the original cable, so you need an adapter for that too. Be prepared to spend about another $25 dollars though on top of your $400 dollar investment(Much cheaper now I guess). I almost wanted to dock a star just for the poor cable but ultimately it's one speedbump in a field of positives.<br/><br/>These headphones can't match the physical feeling of sound vibrations hitting your body from big speakers. However the big speakers can't match the detail the HD 600s give you being right next to your ears either. Unlike stereo systems with subwoofers needing room equalization and treatment, all you have to do it is put these headphones on for near perfect sound. There is no boominess to the bass and it's very fast and tight. The bass is not overpowering and just right. While the Highs sound very crisp and detailed. Vocals are very lifelike. Nora Jones has never sounded better.<br/><br/>Last but not least these are made in Ireland! Good to know there are still SOME electronics not being made in China. I have no problem paying a premium for something that wasn't made in a sweatshop. You don't need to spend $1,000+ dollars on an Amp/Dac to reach these phones potential despite what people tell you. I use an Objective2Amp/DAC Combo that has really low distortion and doesn't color the sound like many Amps Do and it sounds brilliant. I'm not someone that buys new headphones every month and was looking for a great headphone that would last several years. Hopefully this is the one. :)<br/><br/>1/26 Update: I've discovered after listening to these for awhile that I was actually pushing these headphones too loud. Apparently these headphones are EQed for a more distant mellower sound instead of being loud and in-your-face like headphones I was used to in the past. The bass was not strong until I had the volume very loud and then the treble was almost ear piercing. But if I listen at more moderate volumes the bass is not quite as present but blends with with treble perfectly. There seems to be a pretty small window for the volume not being loud enough, to being to loud to get a full clear sound. The default flat settings are not really suited for music with electric guitar as it sounds a bit faint. It's more for relaxed listening when your browsing webpages on your computer or just listening to musical instruments/vocals. Which is Ok with me but thought I'd tell others so they should know what to expect. You'll just need to change Equalizer settings if you want a more aggressive neutral sound. I like switching between the default warm sound and more bright sound depending on the music.

As a studio engineer and producer, I've been wanting to buy these headphones for at least several years.  However I put off purchasing them in favor of getting other less expensive headphones.<br/><br/>I ended up with some Avantone MP1 headphones and some Senn DT-990 to help with mixing.  I already had some Sony 7506 and Audio Technica MTH-M50 for recording.<br/><br/>Well I'm here to tell you, the HD-600 sounds the absolute best and flattest of ALL my head sets!  Whatever adjustments or changes I make on the HD600 is exactly how it comes out on my studio monitors. It's almost a 1 to 1 translation.  This is very important for mixing because you want to make sure that what you do in the studio translates to the real world (other people's listening systems).<br/><br/>My other headphones all seem to have various sound profiles which doesn't exactly produce a good 1 to 1 translation.  For the instance the 7506 is bright, the M50 is more dark &amp; bassy, MP-1 has balance but is not very detailed or lacks depth compared to the HD600.<br/><br/>Although I do like how the DT990 sounds, however, I tend to trust the HD600 more. the HD600 sound profile  makes it particularly accurate and detailed if I'm mixing or doing sound editing.  The 990 does have more bass however, so it can be useful for checking the lower levels of the bass regions in a mix.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, if you do any mixing or editing, the HD600 is well worth the price. I wish i wouldn't have waited so long to get one.  So if you're on the fence about it like I was, just trust me and get it now!!  You can thank me later :-)

To start, these are not closed-back/noise-cancelling headphones, so amazon should remove that as something to "rate" these.<br/><br/>Overall very good sounding headphones, amazing buy for the money.  I have listened to a wide range of music with these and detail and accuracy is above all else.  They are not too bright, and are not bass forward.  I thoroughly enjoy listening to jazz, and more technical rock genres with these because of the level of detail.<br/><br/>The band and pivots are sturdy enough, adjustable up and down.  The pads are removable so you can wash them by hand.  The cables can even be swapped to utilize various other plugs for professional use.  I wear these 6-8 hours a day and they are very comfortable.<br/><br/>I compared these to the ATH-R70x, and while sound was hard to debate (these also sound great, and similar in curve), the ATH-R70x did not fit my head right.  Additionally the ear cups are small for big ears, the HD600 has a more natural shape and position for the ear cups that can accommodate larger heads/ears.<br/><br/>Worth the money!

Tried so many headphones over the years, but keep coming back to the Sennheiser HD600. By far my favorite! Serious base, melodius mid tones, and crisp highs. If you are playing from your PC or mobile device you will need a decent DAC/Amp to drive them as the 300ohm impedance needs some power to make them work their best (I am using the FiiO K5Pro and very happy with it)
----
I just got these, and am breaking them in. They sounds excellent. I have a pair of ported headphones that are also very good, but I want to start doing some home production. I love both sets of headphones. These do not cancel or block noise at all, but I didn't buy them for that. My ported headphones have a little more punch on the bottom end (very little), but these have a wider sound stage. I'm really enjoying them.

If you're reading this, you're deep enough into the audio hobby to have realized an important psychological truth about yourself: you can't leave well enough alone. Neither can I. That's why, even after falling head over heels in love with the sound of the HD650, I ordered the HD600. I just had to know.<br/><br/>The verdict? It's almost too close to call, but for my preferences the 650 is the better headphone. The two have been compared to death online, but if you have the capacity to think for yourself, audio review sites and forums are usually an unsavory if fascinating combination of shilling, self-justification, and "follow the leader" parroting of received opinions. Many self-proclaimed "audiophiles" have strong opinions about equipment they've never actually heard, which I can't accept.<br/><br/>Given that, I decided the only way to compare the two headphones honestly was to listen to both myself for hours, going back and forth on a wide variety of recordings. The difference between a good recording and a bad recording dwarfs the difference between lossy and lossless, and the HD600 (more so than the HD650) may end up changing your taste in music because it makes good recordings sound SO GOOD and bad recordings sound SO BAD. In other words, it reveals the "truth" of the recording, and sometimes the truth hurts—it's really hard to enjoy The Killers now.<br/><br/>The fact is that the 600 and 650 are ultimately more alike than different, and the popular insistence that they sound completely different has more to do with what Freud called "the narcissism of small differences" than the headphones themselves. If you Google some variation on "HD650 vs HD600," you'll hear over and over that the 650 is "bassier" or "darker." Not really. There's actually very little difference across this parameter. Piano music presents an exception, but this is rarely what people think of as a bassy genre.<br/><br/>There are two significant differences. The first is soundstage. The HD650's soundstage is wider, but that doesn't mean it can make a cramped recording sound airy. The HD600's soundstage is more intimate; there's less space between left and right channels, but it's not a huge difference, and I could see people preferring (or at least not minding) the HD600's tighter spacing.<br/><br/>The most striking difference between the two headphones is in what I'd call "smoothness." The best analogy I can think of comes from digital photography. As an image sensor increases its sensitivity, it also increases its noise because you can't amplify a signal without also amplifying noise. There are two rival philosophies for dealing with noise: leave it as "grain" or smooth it out. Grain has its devotees, and the advantage of grain is that it preserves fine detail. The disadvantage is that past a certain point it becomes a distraction. The advantage of smoothness, meanwhile, is that it looks superficially nicer. The disadvantage is that when you look closely you won't see all the fine details. Like all things, it's a continuum of compromise. The 600 is the headphone to get if you value detail at the cost of an occasionally unpleasant grainy and even metallic quality to the sound. The 650 is the one to get if you care more about music than sound and don't care if your headphones sand down the sharp edges of your music a bit.<br/><br/>Going back and forth between the two, it quickly becomes clear that the 650 is the stronger all-around performer: it sounds nicer on more recordings and across more genres. The 600, meanwhile, is the champion of a particular niche: good recordings with lots of micro detail. Want to be able to count how many times the skin of a drum reverberates after it's struck? Want to hear such fine vocal gradations you'll know how a singer felt during recording? The 600 is for you.<br/><br/>Make no mistake: at its best, the 600 produces the most astonishingly detailed sound I've ever heard. Unfortunately, at its worst it sounds grainy, jumbled, and not particularly musical. I'm sorry to report that piano music sounds particularly off on the 600: low frequencies disappear and take the fullness of the keys with them. Vocals can sound oddly recessed, even far away. In general, the 600 seems to fare better with female vocals than male ones, and with strings over pianos. It's absolutely glorious for acoustic guitar, but then, so is the 650.<br/><br/>The 650's great advantage lies in its ability to bring out vocals like a spotlight. They stand out so clearly and powerfully from the instrumentation that you'll feel like you're hearing your favorite songs for the first time. The effect is really quite incredible: it's like there's a special sonic space reserved for vocals and unpolluted by other sounds. Based on Sennheiser's own specs, the 650 has lower distortion than the 600 and it's clearly a more refined driver unit. Whatever the technical reason, the 650's background is pitch black: sounds rise from and fall back into a sea of silence. Be forewarned: a well-recorded vocal track through the 650 may bring tears to your eyes, and that's why I kept the 650 and returned the 600.<br/><br/>Finally, let's talk about measurements. While there's a valid SUBJECTIVE argument for preferring the sound of the 600, the 650 has an objectively better driver that improves on its predecessor in every way: higher sensitivity, lower distortion, and better power handling. Here are the figures straight from Sennheiser's manuals, which you can find for yourself on the product pages for both headphones at bhphotovideo[dot]com. The terminology used isn't consistent from one manual to the other, but the parameters in question are the same. I've noted these variations where applicable.<br/><br/>Frequency response (-10db): 12 – 38,000 Hz (HD600), 10 – 39,500 Hz (HD650)<br/>Impedance: 300 ohms (same for both)<br/>Sensitivity/"Loudness" (Sennheiser also calls this "Sound pressure level at 1 kHz"): 97 dB (HD600), 103 dB (HD650)<br/>Load rating (Sennheiser also calls this "Long-term max. input power"): 0.2W aka 200mW (HD600), 500mW (HD650)<br/>THD (Total Harmonic Distortion): ≤0.1% (HD600), ≤0.05% (HD650)<br/><br/>In short, the HD650 will get louder than the 600 because it has higher sensitivity at the same resistance. The fact that it can handle almost twice as much INPUT power is a positive, not a negative; if you turned a decent amp ALL THE WAY UP with the HD600 connected, you could damage or even destroy the drivers. The 650 has enough headroom for more than twice as much input power, but there's little point in driving your headphones loud enough for permanent hearing loss.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, headphone preference, like any preference, is primarily subjective, and I can't seriously imagine anyone being unhappy with the HD600.

This thing is AMAZING! I've never experienced something similar.<br/>I've been using Bose Q35 Bluetooth for 3 years, and I love it on a daily basis; then I bought the Sennheiser Massdrop 6xx at the beginning of this year; amazing sound, 30-50% better than the Q3. HD600 was a great upgrade, 20-50% better than 6xx. The sound is more clear. I'm using it along with a Fiio Q3 amplifier/DAC. My next (and final) upgrade will be the HD800S, but it will take some time.

For $300, the HD600 even with it's current cheaper -feeling build is still a great value. If you're not an audiophile or don't listen to music with much care for the detail or production, then you probably don't need them. Ironically, the HD600 just so happens to be a headphone that really reveals the quality of the track your listening to. It has a relatively neutral frequency response, but that honestly doesn't say much by itself.<br/><br/>The headphone is primarily great for enjoying mids, while providing sufficient bass and delivering a nice and stinging snare (the way you should want it :O). The imaging and soundstage is relatively narrow, but actually exists unlike on the HD6XX, which lets the HD600 actually let vocals pop-out more. The sound is very in your face, it delivers intensity and a certain rawness without sounding too harsh. It still has detail and reveals the timbre of instrumentals really well. As long as you're driving these headphones pretty well with a good DAC/Amp setup, they should sound magnificent. Acoustic guitar, male vocals, and instrumentals in general are among my favorite type of music for listening to with the HD600.<br/><br/>The only thing, which I think is kind of up for debate is the so called "veil". When I first listened to the HD600 they of course sounded amazing, nearly perfect. When I tried another headphone, however, the Hifiman Edition XS and then switched back to the HD600, things got a little weird. I felt like I couldn't recognize the same sound I had once heard from the HD600. Things just started to sound unclear, but after a day to let my mind refresh, the HD600 sounded fine as they normally would. To this day I'm still unclear as to what the Sennheiser "veil" is supposed to mean, but it might certainly exist. However, this is not an actual problem if you drive these headphones daily.<br/><br/>You don't really even need to read my review to understand how important these headphones are. The tonality of these headphones and what Sennheiser has to offer is pretty much embedded within these headphones. They've withstood the test of time for nearly, what, like 25 years? They're a part of most of audiophile collects I bet, and I know quite a fair number of people who either have the HD600 or the HD6XX. If you want a more neutral and intense sound with actual imaging for more well-produced songs, go for the HD600. If you want a similar sound to the HD600, but something more comfortable in exchange for less soundstage, go for the 6XX, they're better for instrumentals I find.

No Doubt these are excellent headphones. Sony has taken an already established series and made them better. Some may not like that they don’t fold down but the case is slim and it should mean better durability in the long run so I have no issues with it at all as far as that goes. My only real complaints are that the wear sensor rarely works, really 1 out of 10 times will the headphones pause when I remove them…I don’t know if it is because of the sensor being set inside the fabric vs. outside like the M4’s, or something else. May be just my unit I suppose. I don’t absolutely need it to work especially since the touch controls work really well so I can live with that. The only other issue is for comfort. Don’t get me wrong, overall they are super light and comfortable but the light padding on the headband does cause some discomfort after awhile. A little adjustment and it is better but could be an issue for some. I also wish that Sony could do something to make the headphones power on and connect more quickly. If you have them connected to two devices it takes about 10 seconds to connect to both. However the connection is strong and I have no issues with that! And the multi point function works flawlessly!<br/>Noise Cancelling is no doubt the reason to buy these headphones and it is best in class, but as with all noise cancelling headphones there are limitations. It blocks a lot of noise, no doubt, but if the song playing is quiet or the quiet spots between tracks then noise can get through in those moments. It does not block 100% of noise, but it is probably the best I’ve ever tested.<br/>Battery life is as expected, but if you like it loud with max noise canceling as well as the DSEE Extreme and Equalizer enabled the battery life definitely takes a hit, but is still good.<br/>Sound quality is really good. It is not as good as some of my other headphones from Bang and Olufsen, Sennheiser or arguably even the AirPods Max, but is up there. For overall features and noise cancelling these cannot be beat! Another great thing is the speak to chat. It works really well but I keep it off most of the time because it’ll be triggered too easily with a cough or a hum but the great thing is you can toggle the feature on or off by pressing two fingers to the touch pad. Game changer! So if I’m entering a store, for example, I can toggle it on when I enter and then toggle it back off on the way out! That is so awesome to me! Makes the feature so much more sensible for me.<br/>One last note is on the color: I chose the “platinum silver” because I read the black was a finger-print magnet and I wanted to avoid that. This color is okay but kind of blah. But although the headphones are made of recycled materials it still has a slightly more premium build quality than some but is nowhere the build quality of some others like the Bang &amp; Olufsen Beoplay H95’s. But they are unbelievably light weight so that is a good reason to go with those materials. I also love the simple packaging they come in with no plastic and no waste. It’s a nice eco-friendly way to go and I applaud them for that! Overall, these are first-rate headphones and I would highly recommend them (even over the M’4’s as I like the new design and the sound quality, to my ears at least, is improved over the old model).<br/>Update: September 27, 2022. I had to downgrade these to 4 stars because of the wear sensor. Overall they are great, but the wear sensor not working is really bugging me because I feel it should work, after all the XM4’s had a wear sensor that worked much more reliably and since this is the follow up it should work at least as well, if not better. Curious if anyone else has this issue or if it’s just my unit. Also on several occasions the touch control has become completely non responsive and I’ve had to power them off and on again to get it to work again. A little frustrating (especially when you look like an idiot banging repeatedly on the ear cup trying to get it respond).

 I own Sony’s WH-1000 XM4s and the Bose 700s, two of the leading models in the industry. I had AirPods Max for a minute, but I rage-sold them. To me, the Sony and Bose are both awesome headsets. So I was psyched to hear Sony was releasing XM5s. Summer’s here, and these can get a little hot on hot days outdoors. It’s like wearing earmuffs on the beach. But, if you can get past a little sweaty ears, or if you use them indoors or on airplanes, you should be a little excited.<br/><br/>The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones feature, what Sony advertises, “industry-leading noise cancellation.” And they ain’t lyin. With Bluetooth 5.2 and Sony's QN1 and V1 chips, the XM5s have DUAL processors - compared to the lonely single processor of the XM4. These two processors control 8 microphones for crazy accurate noise cancellation. Think - a little computer actually sampling noise from fans, airplane engines, air conditioners, motors, and consistent noise like that  - and creates an identical but perfect opposite wave, so they kinda cancel each other out. And this time, the dual processors are capable of filtering higher frequency sounds, including some voices. It’s pretty cool tech. The first time you hear this, it’s like magic! In my video review, you can see my personal reaction.<br/><br/>With the XM5s, noise canceling is automatically optimized based on your wearing conditions and environment. You don’t have to do anything. It knows if you’re sitting, walking, in an airplane, et cetera.<br/>No, noise reduction probably won’t completely cancel a very loud angry spouse, or a crying baby. But the over the ear closed design may help dull annoying sounds.<br/><br/>A very small cadre of people claim they become nauseous using noise cancelling headphones, and especially the old model XM4s. I’ve never experienced this personally, but be aware it could happen. You can disable it if you need to. Some people thought the WH-1000XM4s were too snug. I thought they felt great, but they’ve improved the fit with a  new lightweight design with soft-fit leather. This material fits snugly but with less pressure on your ears while still keeping out the external sounds you don’t want to hear.<br/><br/>There were a few other design changes – the XM5s aren’t foldable like the XM4s, and there’s a redesigned case that’s collapsible to save room in your bag when you’re wearing your headphones.<br/><br/>With up to 30 hours of battery life, you’ll have enough power to travel halfway to the moon in one of Elon Musk’s rockets. But, in case you forgot to charge and you’re in a hurry, you can get 3 hours' worth of charge after just 3 minutes with an optional AC adapter.<br/><br/>And unfortunately, the in-flight plug adapter is not included in the supplied accessories this time. But who uses that anyway? That’s so old school! Fortunately, there still is an aux-in for you old-school holdouts.<br/><br/>The touch controls survived, where you can pause/play/skip tracks, control volume, activate your voice assistant, and answer phone calls. And the speak to chat lives also, where as soon as you start a conversation, Speak-to-Chat automatically stops your music and lets in ambient sound. And wear detection knows when you take them off.<br/><br/>But – how do they sound?<br/><br/>Sony has popped new, more rigid, 30mm carbon fiber drivers in the XM5s. They have more of an audiophile sound profile with slightly more balanced sound, better clarity, and more accurate bass. That’s important if you listen to real music, you know, with actual instruments, like rock, jazz, r and b, country, classical, and music like that. The XM4s have 40mm drivers, which will probably be better for hip-hop. The XM5s will reproduce hip-hop very accurately, meaning the way the studio producer intended you to hear it, but they probably won’t have the head-vibrating tinnitus-inducing bass many people want. TBH that's hard to find in any headphone due to physics.<br/><br/>The XM5s support LDAC and spatial 3D audio, whatever that is, and they have also upgraded their Sony Music Studios Edge-AI music algorithm, which somehow magically guesses what musical dynamics were lost during compression and tries to replace that, so everything sounds crisp and clean without losing the bass that’s necessary in most of today’s popular music.<br/><br/>I have heard some folks claimed the MX4s sounded “muddy” with some music. I didn’t notice that, but I’m a producer and I’m familiar with equalization. There are about 20 presets including several you can create yourself.<br/><br/>And even without the Qualcomm APTX Low Latency chip, both my XM4s and XM5s allowed me to watch a complete movie on Netflix on my 2022 Samsung Frame television, wirelessly, from 10-plus feet away, with ZERO loss in mouth synchronization. Plus, like my XM4s, the XM5s still have dual Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them with two devices at the same time and switch back and forth between them. It's a pretty cool feature if you use them for your phone, but also want to use them to watch YouTube videos at work on your computer. But, you probably shouldn’t tell your boss about that.<br/><br/>And the XM5s work with Google Assist, Alexa, and Siri. You can even set up Spotify playback with a few taps. Try that on your Air Pods Max.<br/><br/>The big win seems to be a vast improvement in the sound of your voice during phone calls quality. They’re actually impressive when it comes to calling in louder rooms. I’ve made test calls on busy streets and on windy sidewalks, and my call-ee said she couldn’t tell I was actually outdoors. Apparently, the four beam-forming microphones and the dual-processor software can recognize your voice and somehow block a lot of background noise. I mean, you can still probably hear tire screeches, gunshots, and car alarms, things you’ll typically hear in the city. But a lot of the noise is just gone. Like magic!<br/><br/>Oh – and there’s Speak to Chat. You start speaking, and the XM5s automatically adjust noise cancellation to pick up the voices of other people. No buttons, no fumbling with your phone. That’s a pretty cool feature.<br/><br/>So are they worth the upgrade? If you have XM4s and you think your call quality is shaky, then grab some XM5s and sell your sweaty old XM4s on Craigslist. If you’re moving from Bose's Noise Canceling 700 or QuietComfort 45s, the new dual processors and 8 microphone array will provide some noticeable improvements, plus the dual Bluetooth sync, so they’re probably worth looking into. If you’re done with your Air Pods Max and prefer better compatibility with non-Apple stuff including android phones, PCs, and Sony or Samsung Smart TVs, it’s a no-brainer.

The noise cancelation is really good. Like really good. But there are a couple complaints. They won't always block the same amount of noise, so if you live in a semi noisy environment, that really changes the way you look at these headphones. You can hear when the quality of this feature specifically, drops or rises. A really simple fix though, just turn the volume up a little more. Then it really is just you and the music. The transparency mode I felt just slightly let down. It can be better. Speak to chat is much more powerful which upsets me because it's like you don't even have headphones on. You end up wanting that kind of immersion on demand when it's only attainable through the speak/hold to chat features. Of course when those are enabled, the volume of your music gets reduced HEAVILY, so you can hear what's going on. If you're just turning on ambient noise, you might find it muddy or just not as clear as you'd expect or want. An amazing feature with ambient noise though,  is you can control how much noise comes through. This helps me a lot because if you are feeling overwhelmed by your environment, you can just turn it down or shut it off completely. I guess you can say you have a lot of choices between complete isolation, and near perfect immersion. The pros, in my opinion, really overpower the cons. The sound quality is amazing. You can expect crisp, clear, quality audio with insane customization. The separation and sound staging are quite precise I'd say, and with the app you can have practically unlimited bass while still maintaining crisp, prominent highs, that do not interrupt or drown out the mids. Of course the amount of depth these headphones have can only make you dream of what more they may be capable of. I absolutely love the equalizer because now you have such a range with your listening experience, you can resonate with music on so many different levels using the equalizer. These headphones are built for every genre of music BECAUSE they're so precise and customizable as far as sound goes. That's a massive plus, interpreting a song differently because you changed the way it sounded. The smaller drivers do not in any way take from the sound quality. They sound like quality headphones, and the volume control is consistent. The sound quality does not change until about maybe 90-100%. They fit nice, but I wish the design were more like travel headphones where you fold the cups into themselves. They feel very durable, especially the headband. The touch sensors are nice too, but I wish you could use both cups instead of one, so you can customize what taps do what. Overall, they were worth the money. They're for everyone, however you listen, and whatever you listen to. Your preference in sound can be a lot more precise using these headphones. I mean, they really make it hard to say another pair is better. I have grown a lot with these headphones, musically speaking. There are no boundaries in the world of music, and there certainly are not limitations to reach that boundless world inside these headphones.

I must admit I am loving the headphones.  I was a little skeptical at first, but had to figure out how to use them. Only comparison I have is my pre QC bose. Lol<br/><br/>I don't know how compares to nc700 for features.  I really like the touch panel.  Just put your palm up and it will stop so you can hear announcements or talk.  And easy control for pause etc. Not sure yet about the auto noise cancel until I get a flight. But the ambient control works great for around working outside on the patio,  and 20 different settings for how much ambient noise you want to heat,  like walking on a street or something. The case is cool and modern.<br/><br/>Only problem I had was touch panel did not work right away, Sony was going to send me a return pack but I may keep this one.  May have been some setting or Bluetooth connection problem. Seems to be working consistently now.  Also, the phones do show fingerprints easily, but wiping keeps them less noticeable.<br/><br/>Sound quality is customizable with great eqyalizer embedded in the app.  Took me awhile, but was able to tune to my liking and am hearing parts of songs i do not usually hear.  They have several preset equalizer but also 2 custom.  Like that the sound control is in their app.  Overall loving them. I think touch panel only works on vluetooth, not when plugged in.  Not sure.  Using them outside on patio while I work helps drown out the AC and I never reallly wore my other ones anywhere but plane.<br/><br/>I was really interested in the 30 hour battery life and quick-charge.  After having low battery on a couple of business flights in the past,  sensitive to losing NC while traveling.  The app shows percent battery left, which is good.  Plug in capability will be nice on the plane I think. So far started at 60 percent and just down to 16 percent over a few days of listening.  Have not tracked the hours, but several flights for sure.  In 5 mins, got back about 11%.  No real measure. Just ran upstairs to get something , and saw the new percent.  Impressive quick charge.  Will be great for travel.

The MX5s are not perfect but I am still happy with my purchase.<br/>I originally owned a pair of Bose 700 so my comparison is against them.<br/><br/>Build<br/>The build of the MX5 is on par with the 700s. They have a matte finish which feels nice and grippy to the touch. The buttons have a nice feed back when pushing them. Compared to the 700s the feedback is night and day. For the 700s I would often think that I was hitting the button because it had such lite feedback with a squishy feel.<br/><br/>The weight of the MX5 seems to be just a bit lighter than the 700s which I count as a positive because 700s relied more on the headband to carry the weight of the headphones versus clamping force against the ear cups. The MX5s have slightly lighter clamping force on the ear cups but not too little that they feel like they will fall off. They are a great balance of clamping force and weight that neither the headband nor the clamp force feel like they are carrying the full load.  The lighter weight and balanced clamping force make them very nice to wear for long stretches while working. Compared to the 700s I would often start feeling fatigue on my head where the headband would sit because all the weight was supported across it.<br/><br/>The ear cups are also a bit wider on the MX5 but a bit shallower when compared to the 700s. I have ears that stick out a bit more so with the 700s the extra room is welcome. The shallower MX5 do fatigue my ears after a while of wearing them but this was after a full day of wearing them.<br/><br/>The headband adjustment is a bit sticky for my taste. It's a bit difficult to adjust the MX5s because the fulcrum point get the leverage to adjust them sits much higher along the headband compared to the 700s which I can easily adjust with one hand if needed. However, its the 700s would also lose the adjustment very easily compared to the MX5s when moving around because they rubbed against a headrest.<br/><br/>Noise Cancelling<br/>I won't focus on the sound quality because I am not an audiophile. However, the noise cancelling is fantastic.  I would consider them to be a step above the 700s.<br/><br/>Extra Settings<br/>The app gives you a ton of settings to play around with. The main things I find to be better than the 700s is that the MX5s bluetooth is much better. I live near a rather large radio antenna so interference with wireless signals is extremely high. Walking in the other room my 700s would start breaking and stuttering teh signal before disconnecting. The antenna for the MX5s must be better because I can go a bit give or take an additional 5-10 feet. Also when using connecting to 2 sources the switching is seemless. Once sounds stops on one device the second device starts playing right away. My 700s sometimes would refuse to switch and be stuck on one source until I would restart the device or manually disconnect one source.<br/><br/>The app also lets you assign the noise cancellation double a triple tap actions to start a directly interact with a service like spotify. Actually only spotify. I wish the button customization would be opened up to other actions since I don't use spotify its a dead feature for me. The same button can also turn off/on noise cancelling but rather the headphones given a verbal sentence like "Noise Cancelling 5" to let me that I am in ambient sound mode. I need to learn the sound of 3 different tones. The 700s would do and I miss that feature and they would also let you customize the noise cancelling levels that you could cycle through. I'd like to be optimistic and say that sony can adjust these features later but they don't appear to be in the habit of adding features to the app. I also own a pair of the XM4s which are the in noise canceling headphones and I haven't notice anything new in the app since I got them.

I have been using Sony noise canceling earbuds for the last couple of years. I own both the XM3 and XM4 models and I have come to really love both the sound quality and the extra features Sony has packed them. Fast bear on android is amazing, it works without any effort. The first time you turn it on or if you turn it on in pairing mode a picture of the headphones will pop up on a nearby android device and you just click connect, it is as simple as connecting air pods to an iPhone.<br/><br/>Onto these headphones, they are exceptional. Battery life is amazing, but that is to be expected from any premium wireless over your headphones.<br/>The touch controls have a bit of a learning curve, but they are for the most part very good (I have one issue with them, but I will get to that later).<br/>The noise cancelling is amazing of course, but what is more impressive is the improvements made to transparency mode. It no longer picks up background noise from fans and cars as much as it used to. Support for Spotify tap means you can launch Spotify, and have it pick up where you left off without even touching your phone.<br/>The new safe listening feature tells you if you are listening to music at unsafe levels for too long. It keeps track of how much time you listen at various decibel levels so it can tell you if you have been listening too much.<br/>Sound quality is of course very good. Also, Sony's EQ is not the best, but for most people it is more than sufficient. If you like a bit more or less base you can adjust all of that very easily, and it comes with several presets.<br/><br/>The issues:<br/><br/>I have had three issues with my headphones so far. The first one was a strange bug where it identified to my phone as the FCC registered model number instead of as WH 1000 XM5 with a reset after a firmware update.<br/>The next issue is that I have not been able to get it to register with Google's find my device service, it is not a huge deal for me especially because I am less likely to leave the headphones somewhere that I am something smaller like earbuds, but it seems like that can be a bit hit or miss.<br/>The last issue is one that I alluded to earlier, and it is with the touch controls. These headphones do not have a physical Google assistant or any digital assistant button, instead you either say the wake word, or press and hold on the radio until you hear a tone. There is a strange bug when I tried to reply to a text that the Google assistant just read to me. It records my reply, but then says to push the Google assistant button to send or press and hold to record the message. You cannot push the Google assistant button, or you can do is press and hold which will just record the message so you cannot send your reply. However, this does not seem to be an issue when you just try to send a text, only when you reply so it is not the end of the world.<br/><br/>Well, that ended up being longer than I thought it would. I hope someone has found this helpful because I just spent far too long writing it.

I love listening to music but I always try to listen at the lowest volume as to not damage my hearing. The noise cancelling helps so much by cutting out the ambient noises of the wind blowing past in the car or small talk. There’s an app you can download where it automatically adjusts the noice cancellation depending on if your walking, sitting, or in a car! This feature does mess up a few times and turns the noise cancellation down very suddenly when I’m listening in the car which is a bit startling but you can turn this feature off. The headphones themselves are adjustable you just have to pull from the ears. The black color is matte and sometimes there oils from your hands are visible but you can just wipe them. It’s super sleek and they go with everything. I don’t use the case at all I just think it’s too big I just throw it in my bag. The battery life lasts me about 4-5 days but it honestly depends on how much you use them. The quality of the music sounds really good but I haven’t used many headphones other than the koss headphones but i love them and do think they sound really good. They are really comfortable to wear the thing on the eat cups are nice and plush

I'm coming from the Sony H900N so keep that in mind. Immediately noticeable:<br/>1) How lightweight they are compared to my last pair. Night/day difference. These headphones are an upgraded and new form of my old headphones. The actual headphones poke out a little more but weigh much less than my old pair.<br/>2) Design - flawless. I use these for studying, workflow, and eventually working out although I have not done that yet. Very nice to look at, and comfortable to wear.<br/>3) Function - It has all the functions I loved with my old headphones with more sensitive and touch-friendly material on the  headphones which acts as a remote (forward, backward volume up /down/ pause/play, etc. )<br/>4) I have seen a lot of people complain about it not folding down but I have zero complaints. It's not a big deal. In fact, even though my old headphones folded down they were exposed in my bag. If I put my old headphones in its case I feel they were much bulkier than this carrying case. The new case is of quality, light material and has a loop to carry it with. I just stick the whole thing in my bag and feel better about it having the extra protection.<br/>5) I'm very happy with my buy. I only upgraded because my old sony left headphones started to give out after 4-5 years of heavy lifting and use. That itself speaks to the quality of SONY.

When you first get these headsets, you may think 'what is the big deal'?. But then you study the features, the taps, music adjustment settings, music and headphone features, the button, the noise-canceling, auto-shutoff, disable pause while taking, etc.  Touch and hold the right earphone to talk to Alexia.  Tap to hang up. Swipe finger up volume up, down for volume down. Left/Right previous and next.  "Alexia, what time is it?" "Alexia, set 15 min timer" and then when you want to lock people out, the noise canceling can certainly make people disappear. Perfect avoidance strategy as an reason to ignore somebody you don't want to hear. "I don't heaaar you" -- want to hear the clerk at a gas station or drive through and talk for a moment? Couple the right hear with your hand and it temporarily pauses while your hand is there, letting in all ambient sound in. Want to hear what is around AND music at the same time? There is an option that enhances both ambient sound and music at once. You keep both worlds. Or, you can just cancel noise canceling and it works like a regular headphone.<br/><br/>I am glad that I didn't own the previous versions of this headset, because I am understanding it is difficult for people with the WH-1000XM4 to get used to this headset because they are looking for everything to be in the same place they are used to it -- also the feel may be different. Since I didn't own the last version, I was able to give this headset a fair chance and explore all the new, more advanced features and superior sound it has, and I love it so much!<br/><br/>Also, did I mention these headsets can get LOUD? You don't need the volume turned up very high on these. Also, did I talk about the great call quality? My Poly headset was causing issues with the other side hearing me, but I have great call quality with these headsets. I don't have to deal with people not being able to hear me with these.<br/><br/>The only issue, is I wish they were a bit tighter or hugged better when riding my bike.

Ok, well maybe not ever.  But the best headphones that I’ve ever owned.  The sound quality, features, comfort, and price (well, for the under $500 price point) are unmatched to anything that I’ve ever experienced.<br/><br/>Plenty of bass, treble, and midrange for anything that I listen to, with nice functional features like when my wife wants to have a quick conversation (I just hold my hand over the right side of the ear pad and the volume turns low) or if I want to say something without taking the headphones off, it’ll just pause whatever is playing, are nice little features.<br/><br/>I’m sure that there are other over the ear headphones out there that are superior, but nothing that I’ve found at this price point.  My wife loves the comfort even with her multiple ear piercings (sorry, but I’ll have to buy her another pair), and on and on…<br/><br/>The only thing that I wish it had was Google Assistant in addition to Alexa (but whatever, my Google home still hears me with them on), but I won’t even subtract half a star for that.  That would only take a software update anyway… So yea, 5 stars.  No question.

I’m an avid supporter of the Skullcandy brand, owning various forms of their headphones over the years, both for gaming and otherwise. These just didn’t do it for me.<br/><br/>So, I’ve tried both the basic and the $99 version of these now, hated both of them. I’ve been using the previous version of Slyrs from Skullcandy for over 6 years now on Xbox.<br/><br/>The basic $60 version has terrible mic monitoring. I could barely hear myself unless the mic was practically in my mouth. The sound quality of content and other people talking was excellent but I need to be able to hear myself and that just wasn’t happening. People also said I sounded too loud, mostly because I had to have the mic so close to hear myself through the sound canceling cups, even with the monitoring on. This could be an Xbox issue but overall I just didn’t really care for them. It was also hard to balance the sound of games and content over player voices. The quality of sound drops off as you lower the volume of games.<br/><br/>As for the $100 version. The wireless does not work with Xbox. At least, not as far as I found and if I have to look for more than 30 mins I’m not going to bother. The headphones are too complicated as well. I was also getting horrible feedback out of one cup for a while, finally got it to stop although I have no idea how. I was getting constant feedback through both mics, even with it muted and on that note Why? WHY, skullcandy, did you feel the need to have some robot woman come on and announce to me every time I mute the mic???? Do you know how annoying that is? It’s interrupting. I did not like that at all, that in and of itself was enough to make me return these. The balance of voice/game sound was also off to me, again this could be Xbox adding to the issue but I just don’t feel like fiddling with that kind of thing everyday.<br/><br/>The old slyrs just work. Plug them in, hear yourself fine, balance is fine, simple. No need to mess with anything just plug and play, that’s what I was looking for and I was expecting that from this new version and didn’t find it.<br/><br/>Could I maybe adjust to some of these issues over time? Yes. But I practically live in these headsets for a good part of my day and I don’t feel like dealing with minor adjustments or a voice telling me every time I mute myself.<br/><br/>For $100 I expected more and the $60 version just isn’t as good as the $60 original SLYRS I love so dearly.<br/><br/>I was expecting an updated version of what I already had but what I got was either a watered down version or a version with too many bells and whistles. I think these would probably work better for PC where you can use Skullcandy’s custom software.

They fit very comfortably and they're quick to setup. But keep in mind, these headphones do not come with noise cancelling. When you plug them in, you can program the headphones to scroll through different modes; Such as RPG, FPS, or MUSIC. I couldn't tell the difference in this mode. I suppose if you're using them for a PC, you wont have an issue with noise, but me? A PS4 User? That machine is loud, and I can hear it.

Calling this headset "Pro" is an overstatement.<br/><br/>Where should should is start?<br/>The internal USB DAC is very basic and processes at 16bit 48k, as reminder cheap dongles can do 24/192.<br/>I understand the "gaming" focus but the styling makes unusable for work video calls so I am going to stick to my EPOS. The colors are over the top and even though some of it is masked while it is on the head the cables are bright colored.<br/>And the obviously the sound... despite playing with the EQ i could not get rid of the sibilance , muddy mids and undefined bass.<br/><br/>However, my 8 year old daughter thinks these are "supper cute" and adopted them. If you are an 8 year old, maybe these are for you

This skullcandy pro headphone is definitely comfortable to wear. It has good quality sound, with nice bass as well. It has detachble mic to deliver clear sound.It's very simple to connect, as it uses both usb/3.5mm cable. You can also use bluetooth for wireless connection.Good to use for gaming/virtual learning, as well as everyday use. Lightweight,good sound,easy to use.I really like it.
----
I just want to say that this gaming headset is very nice and very reasonably priced. Very good sound quality too.
----
Really happy to see Skullcandy re-entering into the gaming market. Great value for price - you can use the accompanying app to tailor the sound profile to your own hearing needs. And the ear cups are super comfortable - no issues wearing these for an extended period of time!

Once I earned how to set up a Custom EQ (the Settings icon under the EQ) I've been very pleased. What I like is (my taste): boost the bass 2 dbs, attenuate the 400 Hz 2, boost the 1K 1 (this combo gives some punch to the bass), then I boost up the 2.5K 2, the 6.3K up 4, and the 16K up 6. Those last 2 for my old ears.<br/><br/>The noise reduction is excellent, the touch controls good.<br/><br/>I'm happy.
----
So as for the price point I picked this bad boy up on prime day and for a little over a hundred bucks that’s a good deal. Sound quality is pretty good, with the ability to control “your sound” via the equalizer in the app, I mainly got these for the extra bass which it does deliver, but nothing compared to say Crusher Evos. Downside, the app and the headphones sometimes need to update which can take UPWARDS of an hour. Noise canceling isn’t anything to write home about, I have my Bose QCs and AirPod maxes and both of them have better noise cancelling. For the most part it stays pretty steady on your head without a ton of clamping force , HOWEVER for my fellow gym rats, if you’re going to do anything constantly laying down and getting up like sit ups, these will slide right off your head.
----
A gift for the wife for travel on airplanes, especially.  Tested at home and now real-time on a flight after extensive research.<br/><br/>Sound cancellation is great (remember, people: there's no such thing as 100% sound blockage), Bluetooth connects easily with iPhone and iPad and sound quality is really, really good (no audiophiles here; just real users).<br/><br/>Good weight, fit, features.  You could spend more, but why?  I personally like the blue.
----
Great all around, touch controls are a bit sensitive if you’re using them in the gym, but that can be turned off. Volume could be a bit louder but I also just like to blast my music. My only issue has been they seem to randomly switch off when I’m in the gym, has only happened a couple times but since it happened more than once I’m docking a point, could be due to the sweat but I’m not sure.
----
I was a Beats user for the longest and I also order and bought Beats headphones. During prom day I decided to buy this and the Beats to compare and this blew my beats out the way. The noise cancellation is so smooth. The sound quality is so rich. Everything is a perfect balance compared to my beats which were more bass heavy and louder. Over all better ingredients, better quality, better pizza.<br/>- Papa John
----
I love them and use them all the time. My only gripe is that all the controls are on the right side. I’m right handed and am often doing something with my right hand but can’t control the volume, play/stop, etc with my left hand bc it’s too awkward and hard to get to.<br/><br/>On a side note this thing’s battery life is insane! I’ve used it often for a week to two weeks  straight before having to charge it again. It’s wonderful.<br/><br/>The ear pads are soft and really comfortable. And the quality of sounds and bass boost is great.<br/><br/>It was a good purchase and worth the minor UI inconveniences.<br/>(Oh, the app sucks tho)
----
i love these headphones so much! I got them when they were at a discount and i was looking for some headphones with good noise cancelling. After searching i found these and when i received them i got super happy! They were super easy to set up and they are able to adjust automatically to the environment around me to cancel out different noises. I’m also to adjust the volume, change songs, or pause my music by just tapping or sliding on the right little ear piece which i thought was a really cool thing to add!
----
Works great with my phone and tablet for watching movies on the plane and for noise cancelation. Sometimes it doesn't cancel out all the jet engine sound, and it sometimes depends on the angle of your head.  Paired with my laptop for WFH teams calls it sometimes makes me sound like I'm far away so works better with the phone. Pretty comfortable and the battery life is good
----
This is the Best noise canceling headphones i ever owned.<br/>When you turn on the active noise cancelation you will feel totally disconnected from the surrounding. And the sound quality is top tier for average consumers among this segment.
----
Box came a little damaged but product and case were all good. Over all the sound is excellent. Fits over the ear comfortably. Noise cancellation is amazing.

Considering the cost, my expectations weren’t that high. But surprisingly they sound really good. In addition, you can connect through Bluetooth or wired if you have an older device. You can use for the phone but the other caller won’t hear you very clear/loud.<br/>I also can hear sounds on outside  ….but I prefer to hear if someone is calling me or something is going on.
----
Excellent fit and sound for the price. Would highly recommend. My only gripe is that the battery charges to "90%" and dies at around "30%". I still get a few days of it being on for most of the time. It also seems to struggle with staying connected to Bluetooth if no media is playing. Like if I pause a video or music, it might disconnect only for the automated voice to announce it's reconnected. Sometimes several times in a row and sometimes it doesn't reconnect when audio is resumed. And SOMETIMES, the Bluetooth signal might get a bit garbled, disconnected, or static-y. Someone I know who owns a pair said they never have this problem so admittedly it COULD be my old phone struggling a bit. Regardless, even with these flaws, it's still an excellent pair of headphones for the price.
----
I purchased these specifically for the gym. I perspire profusely while working out, &amp; earbuds constantly slip. I have the earbuds for this brand, making me comfortable to purchase the headphones. They work perfectly, connecting to Bluetooth with no issue, canceling sound with no issue, and the volume is great.
----
The headphones provide great sound quality but wow, are they loud. Even when i have the volume as low as it can go, it's too loud. They are fairly comfortable but not comfy enough to forgot you're wearing them. Overall great for the price but wish they weren't so loud on the lowest volume.
----
Would buy them again
----
Got this for my gf, she loves them. The battery life holds all day, while she is working.
----
I gave these a overall 4 star because they do not like to automatically connect to both voice &amp; music every time....sometimes it's just voice.  They are comfortable to wear and other than the connection, everything is great.
----
I'm not sure what to think about these. I haven't had much a good chance to test their sound. My main concern was pairing. These pair with my phone just fine (for now, planning on getting a new phone in a few months).<br/><br/>However, my Nintendo Switch will not recognize them.<br/><br/>But, most importantly, my LAPTOP will not recognize them. The MAIN REASON I GOT THESE WAS SO I COULD CONNECT WIRELESS TO MY LAPTOP!! I CAN'T EVEN USE THEM FOR THIS PURPOSE!<br/><br/>I have tried every single trouble shooting option I can think of. I've even tried to connect to every listed device that shows up. My PC pairs to something, but I'm pretty sure it's someone elses bluetooth device (SCOSCHE BTFM).<br/><br/>What the heck is the point of a pair of wireless, bluetooth headphones that only connect to one device? I need the bluetooth for my laptop. I'm BEYOND frustrated.<br/><br/>This is exactly why I never wanted a pair or bluetooth headphones in the first place.<br/><br/>So, other than working (so far) with my phone, I'm basically out the main reason why I got these. And I'm pissed!

The battery life on these lasted for six eight hour days. The sound isn't as good as like beats or anything but I've always been super brand loyal to skull candy's because they've never let me down. Great sound and the noise cancelling is excellent. I can't hear my annoying coworker at all.

I don't like earbuds and find most other headphones to be too large plus heavy. I love to listen to podcasts and these are ideal for that because they are comfortable. I wish they would make an upgraded version with a more accurate sound (for music), mic, remote, and detachable cable. I've gone through 3 of these because the cable sometimes get accidently snagged to things, messing it up. I would gladly pay double the price if they did this. Nevertheless, these are one of the best values out there.
----
I am hard of hearing and like that the "ears" on these swivel.  I just use for tv and youtube. I can put these on and flip the headphones out. This allows the sound to be directed to my ear but I can still hear the phone, doorbell, meowing cat or conversation in the room. Ear buds, over the ear phones or TV Ears block all that. They are cheap and don't last forever. I get six to twelve months out of them. Weakest point is where the wires enter the headphone.
----
I just bought a new set of these after about 5 years of using the last set. That's a lot longer then I expected these to last for the price. They aren't bad quality, and very comfortable. The noise quality isn't bad for the price, cancellation? Eh, it's okay. Again, for the price, these are great. Lasted many years and they do their job.
----
Bought this because Dad needed an over-the-ears headphone set that wouldn't interfere with hearing aids. He likes to walk and listen to music. He says it does the job but is "tinny", which sounds to me like it doesn't replicate the bass and is probably letting in too much outside noise. However I knew when I bought it that it was not a perfect solution, it was a low-cost option. He will probably replace it at some point but he's still using it so it can't be all bad.
----
My husband has hearing aids, and I didn’t know how he was going to be able to hear on our tour in Israel. Let me explain. The tour guide uses a ‘whisper’ microphone that the group participants hear by plugging earphones into their whisper device. How could my husband use earphones when he needed to have his hearing aids in place? Then I got this idea. He used these lightweight headphones with the whisper device, and he didn’t have any trouble or interference with his hearing aids! We had a great trip.
----
These headphones are quite a bargain for the price. Nothing fancy but lightweight and a really full sound with good bass. I've been using them for a week and already ordered a second pair for back up.
----
I purchased these headphones to use on an 11.5-hour overseas flight. They plugged into the plane's entertainment system just fine and I had two blissful flights. I'd always hated the cheap ear buds the airline handed out, and these headphones made my flights so much more pleasurable. The sound quality was great. For such a reasonable price, I was really impressed!
----
I only keep ordering these because I sit on them or step on them and break them. For my use, they have just the right EQ. Love that they are so light that I can fall asleep with them on in bed, even lying on my side with one ear piece pushing into the pillow.
----
I was not expecting these to be as good as they are at this price point. They have become my favorite headphones that I have owned. Exactly what I was looking for with the color scheme, sound quality, and minimalism.
----
These are great, very lightweight and pack easily.  Fit in my small carry on and work great they look pretty nice as well.

As someone who likes to write music on my free time, I bought these headphones to help me improve my mixing decisions. I also wanted something relatively durable since I’m tired of replacing my $30-40 headphones every year. As a college student, these 569s were an investment for me.<br/><br/>COMFORT:<br/>The HD 569 is my first pair of cans over $40.  And it’s the first pair that I can honestly say is comfortable for long listening and mixing sessions. Ear cups encapsulate my ears, and the padding provides a nice cushion and passive noise isolation.<br/><br/>NOISE-ISOLATION<br/>I go to a military college and it’s common to hear yelling in the hallways. These headphones actually block out a lot of that noise, making it easier to study. I can still hear what’s going on outside my room, but it’s not distracting. Note that the noise-isolation is passive, not active.<br/><br/>SOUND QUALITY<br/>Sound quality is great as far as I can tell. It seems very mid-centric but that’s fine by me. It just took a little getting used to as my brain adjusted to this new normal. However, I wish the highs were emphasized a bit more so I could get a better sense of what’s going on up there. However, it’s also true that recessed highs means less listening fatigue. In other words, these headphones can work fine for mixing, while also being great for casual listeners who just want to enjoy music or watch movies. Soundstage is good too.<br/><br/>DURABILITY<br/>It looks and feels like it will last for at least several years. But take everything I say here with a very small grain of low-sodium salt, because my experience with headphones is limited compared to the many audio professionals here.<br/><br/>I appreciate that it doesn’t use a hinge-style mechanism to clamp the earcups because in my experience those can wear out or break easily. The build quality of this 569 seems better than the MD-7506s I’ve used at a studio. Bear in mind these are just my first-impressions. Regrettably, I missed the time-traveling lesson my friends said I missed in elementary school. So unfortunately, I cannot at this moment tell you how these headphones will hold up in the next few years. But don’t worry - if I remember, I’ll post a 4 month update when I finish my fall semester.<br/><br/>DUST PROBLEM<br/>This is not a huge problem, but I feel it is worth mentioning.<br/><br/>The smaller black circle on the outer face of each earcup easily attracts dust. The padding material on the earcups and headband also suffer from this. It’s frustrating because now I have to pick out/wipe off the dust every few days, especially from the outside. Again, it’s not really that bad if it’s just one or two day’s worth of dust (only takes a minute or so getting it out), but if I let the dust settle for even a week, I imagine it would be a nightmare getting it all out. I dust all horizontal surfaces in my dorm room every day out of habit, so it feels unnatural for me to leave something with dust on it.<br/><br/>This is purely aesthetic; it has zero effect on comfort or sound quality.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/>So far so good. I recommend these HD 569s to anyone looking for a pair of headphones that is comfortable, durable, and has sound quality that is good for both mixing and casual listening.
----
The Sennheiser 569 are comfortable, neutral, well-balanced, and naturally isolating for long-term listening. These are ideal if you are studying, working, or concentrating for hours at a time and you don’t want to be distributed or disturb others. They will not jump out or kick your eardrums, nor do they have extreme highs or lows. They have a very neutral, cozy, warm sound.<br/><br/>They would also be suitable for anyone who doesn’t want the sound to bleed when watching movies, listening to movies, or playing video games. Most likely, the person sitting next to you will not hear them. So also a reasonable consideration for traveling.<br/><br/>The earcups are likely the most comfortable you will ever feel on your head. They disappear and never fit too loose or snug, but that’s my personal experience.<br/><br/>The soundstage is frontal and well-imaged. They are not claustrophobic or overly separated like many other headphone brands and models I’ve tried.<br/><br/>They work fine powered by a phone, laptop, or tablet but will sound fuller with increased depth when amplified. I use the 569s with a NAD - D 3020 V2 combined with an Airport Express 2nd Generation (for Apple Music at cd-quality), and they sound fantastic for long hours of listening while working.

<span class="cr-original-review-content">En general muy buen audifono por el precio, muy conforme.<br/><br/>Luego de unas semanas, estas son mis impresiones. La comodidad es muy buena, las almohadillas son suaves y muy moldeables, pero al ser de un relleno tan suave pierden ese sello para evitar que el sonido escape con el movimiento de la cabeza, se siente como flojo el audífono. En cuando al sonido, muy claro, cristalino y con mucho detalle, con la suficiente cantidad de bajo y agudo, pero con un énfasis especial en los medios. Debido a que son audífonos cerrados y con ese resalte en medios a veces el sonido se escucha como encajado, embotellado, no se como explicarlo, pero no del todo natural. El espacio en el sonido es bastante amplio a los lados, pero no profundo, y eso hace que en ciertas canciones los instrumentos se sientan apretados y amontonados, la separación instrumental no es su fuerte. El cable con microfono es muy funcional, he contestado llamadas y me escuchan sin problemas, asi que un plus en ese sentido, y esto los hace unos todo terreno, escuchar musica, ver peliculas, videojuegos, tambien los veo como buena opción para estudio.<br/><br/>Están muy bien construidos aunque totalmente hechos en plástico, pero no se siente barato ni hacen ruidos al manipularlos, con piezas fácilmente reemplazables, lo que ayuda para que te duren muchos años de uso.<br/><br/>En resumen de nuevo, unos audífonos muy versátiles, con buena calidad de sonido, que creo te duraran muchos años, y que son tal vez la mejor compra en este rango de los 100 dolares.<span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden">

The price was fair, and I like the closed back along with good reports on its sound signature much like the more expensive Sennheiser's. They have decent sound isolation and need very little power to drive them. They are well-made and light. They sound good on just about any mobile audio device. And they really sound great on A&amp;K cube.
----
I'm comparing these to my Sennheiser HD600 headphones.<br/><br/>Being closed back they do a pretty good job at muffling noise, even without active noise cancellation.<br/><br/>The sound is not bad and would be fine for most people (including me).<br/><br/>You will need to purchase a longer 3.5mm cable or a 6.3mm to 3.5mm adapter. The included 1.2m 3.5mm cable is way too short for anything, except maybe a phone in your pocket.<br/><br/>The way the head piece attaches to the ear cups is weird. When putting the headphones on and taking them off the asymmetrical attachment is strange and makes me thing I'm going to drop them or something is broken. While wearing them I do not notice this and they are comfortable, though not as much as my HD600. Mostly, I think, due to the extra weight.<br/><br/>The cable coming from the left ear cup is also (to me) weird. All the headphones I've owned have had the cable either come out of both or just the right ear cup.<br/><br/>The price of $110 isn't bad.
----
For the price these are impressive!  The sleek design is light yet sturdy, the ear pads are very comfortable, and the sound is quite acceptable to very good.  They have a nice midrange with decent bass, I fine tune all my headphones with a preamp and these zero in nicely.  I’ve been using a set of Beyerdynamic DT 770s for a while and after they were stolen I bought a new set to replace them.  The quality of the DT 770s has declined since I purchased the 1st set and I was no longer happy with them.  Going with the Sennheiser HD 560s as a lateral move I was very pleased.  The sound is nicer, they are easier to drive, and they are just as comfortable as the Beyerdynamics and fit nicer on my head.<br/>The only draw back is the cord, it seems like  headphone manufacturers are skimping on the cords these days to cut cost or something.  The cord with the HD 569s is too wobbly and has somewhat of a tacky feel and it tangles easily, other than that, these would have been 5 star headphones.<br/>These are very well designed, and In the $100.00 to $150.00 price range, I haven’t come across anything nicer.  This is the first purchase I’ve made from Amazon in quite a while that seem to be worth what I payed for it (not their usual Asian junk, although made in China).<br/>Recommend!  Worth ordering just to try them out even if they are returned.
----
I bought these to start a podcast. My usual headphones are Bose 700s. But I needed wired phones.<br/>Sennheiser always makes splendid products. These are excellent.<br/>I could not hope for better sound. I love these. And they are the most comfortable headphones I've ever had. Note, these are studio phones so no mic. Highly recommended.
----
The price is right, the sound is great. I can wear them for a long period without discomfort. They work with everything I’ve plugged them into, even my iPhone, excellently.<br/>I’d definitely buy them again.
----
I am using this with Tidal music service to listen to the master quality audio, bought a THX Onyx with it , have an apple phone had to buy a camera to lighting port dongle which it suggests.  So far so good I haven’t had the time to listen to everything.  What I have listened to is on par with the price.  Of course there are better ones out there but 400.00 is too much for me.  I prefer the noise canceling without hearing outside noises.  The comfort is good.  I really want to hear on a recording something I haven’t heard normally the little things that I never have heard before on a favorite song,  that what gets me excited.
----
I've seen a few complaints about these cans here concerning headband and ear cushion wear issues. I cannot comment on that yet, but I have to say that these are the best headphones I've ever worn and I've been around for 65 years.<br/><br/>Comfort A+<br/><br/>These are closed-back and other than the closed in sensation, which is to be expected, they are a dream so far. That's saying something because I have a huge melon and I haven't even stretched them out yet! I own the HD 58x Jubilees and they took some time to break in and it took some "gorillaing" to stretch them out to help that. These felt great out of the box.<br/><br/>Weight - what weight?<br/><br/>Sound:<br/><br/>Keep in mind that I'm coming at this from an audiophile perspective. I won't grade them on a scale because everyone is looking for something different. These are no dubstep or hip-hop phones unless you are mixing with them. These are more like real professional monitors than entertainment cans. They could use maybe 3dB more bass, but I'd rather have a little less than too much. Compared to the Jubilees, they are a little thin, but I feel that the 58x's can be a bit too much and the bass seems to overload (distort) too soon. The mids are perfect and vocals are clean and accurate. I can't speak for the highs because I'm old and lost the highs long ago. I do wear hearing aids and they seem fine, but I don't even remember what natural high frequencies sound like. These artificial (Oticon) highs do sound great thru these though. I'll leave it at that. Put it this way: I currently have a pair of Buchardt s300s (traded in KEF LS50s.) and these are a lot closer to what those sound like than anything else I've heard. All cans seem bass-heavy to me lately (other than Apple Airpods and some on-ear sets - honorable mention to the Cooler Master 751, which I game with). These are a relief from the usual mud.<br/><br/>Gaming:<br/><br/>No mic, but if you just want to hear them coming, these are great. Sharp with detail and no artificial boom or slop. If you are familiar with the Cooler Master 751, these are balanced like those, but have much better detail and similar comfort. If you crave bass, I'd recommend the Jubilees. They have that and more. They will need breaking in on the comfort end though.<br/><br/>Efficiency:<br/><br/>Easy to drive! On an iPhone, I'm about about 35% through the Apple DAC dongle. You don't have to waste money on an amp. I would recommend a good DAC on a PC though. A Dragonfly Black would suffice. It sure beats an onboard chip.<br/><br/>In short, I wouldn't recommend these for someone buying their first set. They are for the "mature" listener. If you want something that can use a small bass boost to get you there, these are great. If you hate boosted bass, these are perfect. You won't have to change a thing.

I picked these in large part because they don't have a microphone (which I don't need); my new iPad has USB-c instead of lightening connector.  When I plugged them in to test, I was amazed at how good they sound.
----
Sound good enough. Usbc is handy.<br/><br/>They designed the speakers assuming people's ears are parallel I guess.<br/>I had to twist the speakers. But do it carefully as you will shatter the plastic.
----
Bought these for my son in mid June, he told me today that they stopped working. So they only lasted 3 1/2 months...
----
Second set of these failed in the exact same manner as the 1st.  Wire coming out of usb connector has no strain relief and breaks at the connector.
----
When we first got these headphones, the sound quality was great.  My son found them to be very comfortable.  Now, less than 2 months later, one ear is not working at all.
----
This product was absolutely terrible! it was for a senior and he was so disappointed in how it broke so easily....terrible
----
I was taking a chance and buying used, but holy cow, it's not used. The headset arrived completely broken.
----
Product worked for the once and then it stopped functioning.
----
EDIT: After having the first set replaced due to scratchy feedback almost constantly, the 2nd set was great. That lasted about 2 weeks, then it also developed a high pitched scratchy sound. I really loved these when it worked. Not going for a 3rd try, refund and will keep looking. Lots of usb c earbuds out there, but I cannot stand earbuds. Don't know why headphones like these are hard to find. And adapters get screwy with my phone. Hopefully I am not out of luck.<br/><br/>They are far from "perfect" but perfect enough for what I listen to, which are audiobooks. I had to exchange the first pair I got, decided to try once and see if a second pair was better. First one had a bad crackly static sound going on constantly. The replacement pair is fine. I have and use a bluetooth headband style at night, but prefer these otherwise. (I cannot stand earbuds) I wanted something I did not need to remember to charge, and with a lot of phones removing the standard headphone plug and requiring use of the USB C power connector or bluetooth, I went looking for something exactly like this. Yes, they're cheap, no they probably aren't the best for extreme jamming out to music, although they are good at lower volumes with music. I am sure more expensive ones are great for concert level volumes, but since I use them for books, and did not want to spend too much, these absolutely fit my needs. The cable is a perfect length, long enough that if I am sitting on my bed with the phone on the wireless charger next to the bed, it does not pull the phone off when I move around. They are very comfortable on my ears, and easily adjustable on the length from the top of my head. I would definitely purchase them again if I needed another pair.

Pros:<br/>- Decent price point for the product<br/>- Fully covers ears<br/>- Comes with a carrying case<br/>- Holds a pretty good charge (that being said, I am using these intermittently)<br/>- Easily connects to computer Bluetooth (used TP-Link adapter, myself)<br/>-Easy to use controls (on each surface and on the sides)<br/>-Easy to follow instructional card<br/>-Decent sound quality<br/>Cons:<br/>~ Subpar noise cancellation. This is the biggest draw-back to me using these any more than I already am. They are on par with my Raycons that don’t have any external noise reduction features. I can hear everything happening in a room. There are 3 controls for noise cancellation: going from NC to awareness OR off makes you feel like you’re underwater and there is no discernible difference in noise cancellation between these three very different settings. When compared to something like an AirPod Pro, it’s not even in the same league.<br/>~Uncomfortable on head. These squeeze a little too tightly and when they’re shaped, they don’t hold the shape super well. Other headphones/headsets I’ve had over the years will hold a shape after a few days, but these just won’t budge.<br/>Overall, these are an average set of headphones. I don’t personally see anything special about them. If you’re trying to get a pair of headphones solely for the noise cancelling feature, I recommend not getting these. Otherwise, they’re alright.
----
The sound quality is not as good as some more expensive headphones, but these are a good value for the money. YOU CAN CONTROL EVERYTHING BY TOUCHING YOUR EAR CUP!
----
Incredibly comfortable with outstanding sound!! Never going to buy anything else. Excellent buy! Meets expectations.
----
The app does not support this model, so no EQ.  Even though it is advertised.<br/><br/>ANC is medicore.<br/><br/>Randomly unpairs during Zoom calls, I cannot trust them.<br/><br/>Too tight and uncomfortable, and here is the WEIRD thing.  If I am laying down and put any pressure on the right ear it will create pressure feedback between the driver and my ear.  I felt like my eardrum was about to explode and had to literally fling them off of my head.<br/><br/>No easy way to contact support, even after registering.<br/><br/>Not even worth the cheapest ANC's.
----
These are really comfortable for me - I have a small head. Sometimes headphones sit really low on my ears and push down with the cups. These are really comfortable - comfortable enough that I can wear them for long periods of time while working.<br/><br/>They also work surprisingly well on PC. Many pairs of headphones I've had are optimized for phones. Then, when bluetooth pairing to my PC (Windows 11) they sound a little off, or I have to mess around with the windows audio settings to get windows to treat them like proper headphones (something to do with the fact that a mic is detected I think).<br/><br/>These work great out of the box with Windows. When I turn them on my audio source changes automatically. The connectivity with my Bluetooth 5.1 card is excellent as well. For the price point, the sound is solid. There is certainly better sound at higher prices but these sound really nice - keep in mind I'm primarily using them for audio that includes talking like podcasts and video conferencing.<br/><br/>I will say that the ANC is kind of iffy. I've had much better ANC from other devices. I wear these right next to my AC unit and my window and the difference between ANC off and ANC on is barely there. The higher pitched air-movement sounds are hardly blocked by the headset.

Wow, these headphones are incredible!<br/><br/>I have a very loud toddler and I needed some noise canceling headphones that would block out the noise and be comfortable to wear all day. I've found that in these Philips headphones.<br/><br/>I love the touch controls. For the right cup only, swipe up to raise volume, down to decrease it. Forward or backwards to change the song. Double tap to pause or play. And perhaps most importantly, the ability to temporarily mute by placing a flat palm on the surface of the cup. This makes it easy to exchange a few words or double check the sound you thought you heard. I am addicted to this feature.<br/><br/>Highly recommend these. Comfortable on my small head. Get it, you won't regret it!

On first impressions, the H8506 looks like it’s taking a page right out of some premium headsets out there in design and functionality. I can appreciate the sleek, matte black, plastic finish, but I did notice that the surface is a fingerprint magnet, so be prepared to clean them often. They also seem a bit flimsy and prone to scratching, so I would avoid dropping them. Also, I am not comfortable stretching the headband too much as it does creak a bit. While there is no full swiveling on the cups, the headsets do fold 90 degrees and can collapse -great for storing them in the included handy clam-shell case.<br/><br/>However, the light build makes them quite comfortable. My ears fit snugly inside the cups and the leatherette pads are soft. There’s some clamping force to keep them in place but not enough to make them uncomfortable. I do wish there was a bit more padding on top, but I didn’t notice that until I wore them for a few hours. At that time, I also noticed that my ears did get a little bit hot.<br/><br/>Featuring Bluetooth 5.0, these headsets paired easily with any device I tried them on. There were no noticeable lag or sync issues, and they reached decent distances without breaking up. By the way, I really appreciate multi-point pairing as I was able to switch back and forth between my tablet and my phone seamlessly. And just in case, the headset also sports a 3.5mm jack and cord when needed.<br/><br/>The touch controls worked well for me as they are intuitive and responsive. I wish I could try them when it’s cold because other similar headsets have failed then. I guess we will see. I appreciate the feature of covering the right cup to stop the music and activate the ambient sound mode -just like those other much more expensive ones. Going from ambient mode to noise-canceling is easy by pressing an actual button and the same goes for muting the mic and powering on/off.<br/><br/>Speaking of ANC, it’s good enough to block most lower sounds and rumblings. I could still hear a lot -especially traffic when not playing anything, but when the music is playing, this is not an issue at all.<br/><br/>The call quality is what anyone would expect from any Bluetooth headset. I was heard loud and clear in different environments, albeit a bit tinny.<br/><br/>At 60 hours per full charge and 45 with ANC on, this headset is a beast when it comes to battery life. It’s charged via USB-C and even has quick-charge capabilities.<br/><br/>But how do they sound? I will say they are decent. This is an area where the difference between other premium (and more expensive) headphones is obvious, considering that they claim HI-RES (7-40KHz through wired mode). Out of the box, I found the 40mm drivers deliver a bass that is lacking some punch and a bit too loose for my taste. The mids and highs made the sound signature a bit too bright. The good news is that there is a companion app where you can select sound presets and mess around with an EQ. I found the bass boost the best preset overall. The bass was still a bit sloppy, but it gave the sound a warmer, fuller signature, while the midrange and treble were still noticeable and were not fully distorted, maintaining a good level of clarity. There was good channel separation and soundstage. Unfortunately, I found that the set did not respond as well to EQ changes as I would have liked. In the end, I found them good enough to listen to any genre, but definitely not for critical purposes.<br/><br/>Featuring a sleek design, ANC functionality, decent comfort, instinctive controls, multi-point connection, and massive battery life, Philips has delivered a lot of value with the H8506. Although I am a little disappointed that they did not meet the HI-RES expectation in my opinion, for the asking price, I would still recommend them wholeheartedly.
----
These delivered on sound quality and have an excellent app for fine tuning. The ANC is just adequate but not impressive, same with comfort level wearing them. Also, those around me can hear what I'm listening to when I'm wearing them because they don't insulate the sound as well as other pairs that I have do. To the point they can actually sing along with what I have on, not just hear muffled sounds. They come with a nice protective case.
----
I had a long review written and hit the wrong button and BAM it was gone. Not sure that I can do it again, Ok headphones if you are on a budget. Cheap feeling, the guide inside the case is actually TAPED IN, for real, Sound quality is only ok. Can’t really speak about battery life, although seems great, or noise cancelation as I wouldn’t wear these out in public! Sorry. They look ok, the ear cups have slim profile which I like and are comfortable, I suppose, but the headband expands near the top which I think looks stupid on your head. Also, unlike the Technics A800 headphones (much better headphone but more costly) you cannot turn off the blinking blue Bluetooth light which bugs me. They have a good number of features from more expensive headphones like a “quick Attention” mode ala Sony and responsive touch controls on the right ear cup. Again, if on a budget these might do ok for you. Sound quality is ok, only helped a little by the EQ in the app. I guess for the price, these are not the worst out there and that is something since there are so many bad cheap headphones available!
----
Sound:<br/>- Lacks bass.  Enabling the “bass” EQ profile on their app helps slightly, but also makes everything more muddled.  Tried burning-in for 24 hours, but that didn’t produce a marked difference.<br/><br/>Fit:<br/>- Isn’t great on bigger heads (for reference, I wear XL/XXL helmet/hats); ear squeeze gets annoying after half an hour or so of wear, and there’s a bit of pressure on the top of my head.<br/>- The ear pads look thick, but only squish down about half way before bottoming out on the hidden frame.<br/><br/>Build:<br/>- The plastic used feels a little cheap<br/>- One of the plastic-on-plastic hinges annoyingly creaks whenever I turn my head.<br/><br/>Etc:<br/>- Battery life is good.  8 hours of play at mid volume with ambient sound mode on only used 10%.<br/>- iOS app works fine (despite its current 1* rating), enabling a few things you can’t do on the headphones alone (pics), like changing the levels of ANC and ambient sound, use of a sound profile or a manual EQ, turning on/off BT multi-connection, and turning on/off the touchpad.<br/>- The accessories and features are nice and about on par with Sony’s, with identical control gestures, 2 simultaneous BT connections, an extra voice assistant button, etc.  One thing I miss is the ability to check the battery level without an app; on my Sony, a tap of the power button will read out the remaining battery percentage.

First off, we purchased this for my 4 year old son. He loves the light up lightning detail and has zero complaints about the comfort or noise levels. They also fit his head perfectly and the extension allows it to fit my husband's head as well. He tried the headphones on and compared them to his Sony 'noise canceling' headphones. He said hands down these were better LOL! Which also means my 4 year old can't hear us if he has them on, even at the controlled volume level off his tablet. Ohhh they also come with an auxiliary cord so should the battery die, you can still use them. Awesome for when we forget to charge the headphones
----
Can't say enough good so far
----
I have tried several headphones for my son whois 8 and these have been his favorite.
----
Perfect thanks
----
Lightning bolts light up
----
The design, comfort, the LED light= perfect 10<br/>The manner of packaging and deliver=perfect 10<br/>We tested it for loudness= 0<br/>My son is 9y/o when we turn the volume, it is too loud on the lowest volume.<br/>I am seating next to my son as we test the headset I put it on the lowest volume around 2-3, he did not even place it on his ears just around the neck but I can hear it loud and clear it’s as if it is the highest volume…. We still kept it for me since but I told my some not to use it coz it will damage his hearing…..
----
Great headphones no issues yet!
----
These are really cute headphones. The lights are silly, but it's fun for kids. The bluetooth range worked really good on my test run with my TV. The listing says up to 36ft, but I went further than that. In fact, I never got out of range walking to the other side of the house.<br/><br/>The only problem is the volume. I turned it all the way up, and it was not nearly as loud as better headphones at about 60% volume. Of course, you shouldn't expect the volume or sound quality of higher priced units, but just manage your expectations in those departments.
----
I can't tell you how many kid's headphones we've been through. It's well over ten. These are my current favorite. They're attractive and comfortable. The Bluetooth pairs quickly and the battery life is excellent. My favorite feature though is that the on-off button is a mechanical slide rather than the press-and-hold of most other headphones. It's actually really difficult for younger kids to work the press-and-hold mechanism so I always have to turn the headphones on for them. A mechanical slide power button is much simpler and easier for kids to operate so they can have more autonomy with their headphones.
----
These were easy to pair but I love that there's an option to just plug in to an audio port because then you never worry about batteries if you have a device with an audio port. A tiny light flashes blue for on/trying to connect and red for powering off. When powered on you have the option to light up the lightning bolts in a few different ways, solid or flashing. The max volume was sufficient without being super duper loud. I couldn't tell the difference between when it was off and on for noise cancellation. I could still hear some white noise and other noises in the room when I tried them on but they were definitely quieter because of fitting around your ear. I'd recommend these for anyone looking for cute and functional kid headphones, if you don't care about it not being super noise-cancelling.

I finally bit the bullet and decided to buy these after reading the reviews. I was desperate for a pair of noise cancelling headphones when I was trying to finish my college thesis in a house with 6 rowdy roommates. These were a lifesaver. I finally was able to focus. Additionally. It helped me not feel as overstimulated when I went to somewhere like the grocery store, or dulling traffic noises when I went on a walk. I would always be so surprised when I took the headphones off at how loud the ambient noise around me was, even though I didn’t pay any mind to it before. It’s not perfect, for example when riding the bus it would dull out most of the engine noises, but when we hit a bump I would hear some popping noises as it would be quite Loud and very close. Still much better than without the headphones. It was also really important to me to have comfort, since I have multiple ear piercings and the beats headphones I tried earlier would press into them which would be pretty painful. Even if I found a good position for it, it would still hurt my head after a few hours. With these, I don’t have that problem! They fit completely over my ears, so I never have to worry about my piercings, and the cushioning is very soft so I’ve worn these bad boys for hours and hours and never felt any discomfort! Unfortunately I lost my pair at a bar a few months ago, and I was bummed because they were great headphones, but so expensive. I finally decided to repurchase them after catching a flash sale because I do truly think these are worth the money. I’m not an audiophile, but i do really love the sound quality as well. I hear new things in songs I’ve always loved by listening to them with these. The cons of this product are the following: 1. I wish these headphones worked with the Findmy feature or at least had some other way of tracking their location when lost. I know other Bose products do, and I think that for $300+, it’s not unreasonable to ask for a locating feature so I don’t lose these (again). Especially since these headphones already have their own app. The other con is that these headphones are not water resistant. I don’t think it’s a huge deal breaker for me as I don’t plan on wearing them swimming, but sometimes I worry about walking in a light drizzle with them on. Nothing has actually happened so far when I have done this, (usually I can just put my hood up or something)  but the booklet it comes with specifies that any water is something to avoid, so it does loom in the back of my mind. All In all though.
----
These headphones came recommended by another web developer I follow online and I could not believe how much I liked them. $300 seemed like a lot of money for headphones, and it definitely is, but I would say that it's worth it.<br/><br/>Compared to other headphones I've purchased, these things are leagues ahead in regard to sound, comfort, and even the mic for a bluetooth set.<br/><br/>In regard to sound, there is an app you can use to alter the EQ settings and I've found this to be really helpful. I've read reviews that noted these were not bassy enough or just that the sound was not that great, of which I haven't had any sort of issue in regard to the sound quality. Compared to other in-ear and over-ear headphones I've used over the years, I'm very happy with the sound and the ability to even tweak these a little.<br/><br/>These things are comfortable. I work at a computer all day and these are the only headphones I can comfortably wear for hours at a time that I've tried. I usually take them off after a couple hours if my ears get too warm, but for the most part this takes several hours and based on the design it makes sense this would be a problem at a certain point.<br/><br/>The mic quality is one of the things I'm pretty excited about with a bluetooth set of headphones. A really good quality mic and the ability to connect to multiple devices at once (I'm on my laptop listening to music but can stay connected to my phone so I don't have to switch to pick up a call - just pause the music!).<br/><br/>I've owned, and still do, Airpod Pros for in-ear set and I usually use these on calls because I don't like having over-ear headphones on for that, but I had to buy a USB mic due to the poor mic quality on the Airpod Pros. With these, I've tested in local recordings and asked people about the quality of the mic during the call and they're always impressed it's on a set of bluetooth headphones.<br/><br/>Noise canceling capabilities are pretty good. My wife and I both work from home with offices right next to each other and I cannot hear her at all if I've got the headphones on and music playing even lightly. The ability to switch between noise canceling and the Aware setting is nice as I can switch up the settings when I need to hear others around me.<br/><br/>Overall, super happy and a little surprised that I feel like I got my money's worth with these. Time will tell how well they hold up, but these really are the best pair of headphones I've ever owned. Nothing else has even come close.
----
Coming from the qc25's I really expected a lot more from these. I've had them for about 2-3 months and have used them everyday, I usually use them to sleep as my house can be pretty noisy in the early morning. While the noise cancellation is great compared to the qc-25s they really made things so complicated with the user experience. From using the app to using these wired it can be pretty confusing at first! For example if I am in Bluetooth mode and I plug the wire into my computer the sound will immediately go to the lowest setting on the headphones forcing me to turn it up and this is every single time I plug into wired. It's really a pain but I'm used to it by this point, it's just very confusing to me why it would preset the audio to the lowest point when connecting via 3.5mm. Other than that the sound quality isn't amazing, in my head its a little flat compared to the qc25's which I always thought of as bass-heavy. In the end though I am happy with my purchase as my main goal with these was to be able to sleep in past 6am without being woken up which they do wonderfully especially with some white noise or ambient sound playing!
----
Pretty pleased with this purchase.  I previously purchased Bose hardwired headphones about 10 years ago and loved them. When these were featured on Amazon and were wireless, I purchased them<br/><br/>I primary use them with my IPhone and Spotify music. The noise cancellation option works pretty well and allows me to enjoy the music without distraction.  The padding on the phone is extremely comfortable that I use them to fall asleep.<br/><br/>Relatively holds its charge pretty well for full day of music<br/><br/>I attempted to hook them to my laptop with the wire but was unable to listen to a teams call.  I am chalking this up to my lack of technical skill<br/><br/>Recommend this product for others.
----
I really enjoy using these all the time the noise canceling isn’t 100% but nothing I have tried really is. It is still really good and I can’t hear almost all things around me. The base is also good! I needed to use the app to get the base to be perfect. It’s still good at a default but the customization that the app offers is phenomenal. This is my first pair of noise canceling headphones and I am beyond satisfied. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a pair of quality headphones with noise canceling modes.

I did a lot of research looking into bluetooth headphones; as someone with hearing damage and is very picky about how their headphones rest on their ears, I knew I couldn't settle. I bought various other pairs before trying Bose Quiet Comfort, such as KVIDIO (Not tight to head/sound leaking, bassy sound), Sennheiser 350BT (Pinched my ears, quieter than other sets, could hear myself in calls and couldn't turn off in app), and Soundcore Q35 (Entirely different sound depending on the device and if plugged in, couldn't listen to music and be in voice call at same time without plugging in), all of which had their dilemmas. I really wanted a nice pair of bluetooth headphones for cheap, but in my search I recognized that wasn't possible, so I saved up what I had and thankfully snagged this on discount (bought for $180).<br/><br/>The sound is absolutely immersive; my worries about these headphones was that the bass was going to be too heavy, as SONY bluetooth headphones and other sets in this price range are usually very bass heavy. Fortunately, that wasn't the case with Quiet Comfort; it's strong, but it doesn't overpower. The mids and treble sound great too, and I can't say I've had any issues with listening to music, calls with friends, etc, other than those friends having shoddy microphones (No problem though).<br/><br/>The fit on this set is also solid; I have noticed in warmer weather that my ears get sweaty, but that's to be expected with any headset that's over-ear. My only note is that I noticed the inside of the headphones have molded to my ear. When I first got them, the meshy material with the L and R was flat, but now it's slightly caved in. I'm not sure if it's impacted anything, because I haven't heard a difference in sound, and they don't feel different. I will keep an eye on it for when I update this review.<br/><br/>The controls are simple, a switch on button and three buttons to turn up, down, pause, and skip music (and if on mobile, to use your voice assistant) on the right cuff. On the left, the only button is the noise cancelling (two settings; aware and noise-cancel). I enjoy that this headset has two ports, one for charging, and another to plug them into the device to use instead of bluetooth. However, I will note to anyone that uses these headphones plugged in; when the set is in wired mode, it disables bluetooth, and when still on it sounds incredibly quiet. And, when turned off and plugged in, the EQ and Stereo Sound disable, so using the headphones without them being on is really rough. These doesn't steer me away from using them though, as I mainly use them on and via bluetooth. I mean, to be honest, who uses bluetooth headphones with a wire anyway unless they're dead?<br/><br/>I'm also actually pretty impressed by the battery on these. They last me all day and night, and I plug them in when I sleep. They charge really fast, and I've only had two occasions of low battery, mainly due to me forgetting to charge em.<br/><br/>Overall, my only worry onward is the deterioration, if there is any, and possible connection issues. Haven't had those yet, and hopefully I won't in a year.

The Bose Quiet Comfort 45 noise cancelling headphones are quite good - for the most part. They seem to keep external noise from being heard by folks on the other end of my calls, and definitely reduce the external noise that I hear as well. My only issue is that sometimes the mic doesn't seem to work or connect. I've been on a few calls, Teams and Zoom, in which the other parties can't hear me at all - even though all controls show that I'm not muted. I've never had that issue before using these headphones, so presumably, it's an issue with the headphones. Ultimately, they're far better than worse.
----
I’ve been doing my research and debating on the right pair of headphones for like 3 months. I haven’t gotten a pair for at least 3 years or so. After comparing prices and features and quality. I’ve decided on this model and I absolutely love it! The quality and battery life is good to go for a couple of days for me. It’s also very fitting and stays well on my ears! No complaints satisfied with this purchase.
----
I really liked these headphones and they have solid noise cancellation however I feel that the reviews did exaggerate a bit.<br/>These headphones do not completely cancel out all noise. I can still hear the TV in the background and I can still hear the muffled noises of people talking. The noise is still present however heavily reduced which is good if you plan on using them while listening to music.<br/>However if you want headphones that completely block out all noise without anything playing through them then maybe try out a few other options before deciding on these.<br/>The bass on the headphones is a lot better than I had anticipated and the sound quality is also pretty good. However I was having some issues with being able to switch between aware and quiet modes using the buttons. It’s been only 3 months since I got them and sometimes the button doesn’t work and I need to do it through there app.<br/>Other than these few issues I would say they were a strong headphone choice compared to their competitors with a lot of battery life and I would recommend them as an option to others.
----
I had resisted buy these for years, telling myself that I couldn't see spending that much on headphones- if you travel very much at all, do yourself a favor and invest in your sanity. Make so much difference in how you feel after a flight. I wear them even if I am not actively listening to anything just to drown out the noise.

Just came back from a run in the AZ heat. I am a sweater...yep, I said it. So I needed a sweat proof, stable, good pair of over the ear headphones. These are a mix of over the ear / on the ear..more on the ear style. I definitely tested them today. I think the material of the ear cups will be good for longevity.  They fit my small head well. They didn't wobble when I ran. I spend ALOT of time researching headphones because they are Very important to my daily workouts. If I dont have a good pair, they can kinda ruin the experience.  That's all great for my positives...of you are looking for a good " inexpensive " pair, these will do.<br/>However that being said, if you are also looking for noise canceling or great sound,  these will not be those. They are ok. Decent even. I will keep them as my backups and occasional use, but most likely not my every day wear.
----
I originally wanted beats solos but they squeezed my ears so I returned them. I was nervous about over the head headphones but I have these a try since they’re cheaper. I love that my ears don’t sweat because the muffs are sponge instead of plastic. It’s very comfortable to wear and I can adjust it a lot. What I love most is the battery life I hardly charge them and I use them daily for hours. Wish it came with a case will buy one if I find it. I’ve had them for two months so I can’t tell how long they will last but so far so good. My one complaint is this weird static noise makes sometimes. It’s a one off sound that happens maybe 1-3 times a day but it really doesn’t affect what I’m listening to.
----
I caught these on sale right as I started going back to the gym after several years of slacking off. I use these for about an hour a day every day and they're probably my favorite headphones I've ever had. The cooling material in the cushions is super comfy and keeps you from feeling overheated while working out. I've never had any connectivity issues with bluetooth and in the three months that I've had these I've only had to charge them one time! Are there better headphones out there? Maybe...but you'd probably end up paying way more for something that's marginally better. For the price these are amazing.
----
First off, it's important to note that these headphones fill a niche: somebody who wants an over-ear style closed-back headset that has some degree of water/dust resistance (in this case, IP55). They probably shouldn't be the only pair of headphones you own and use. These are ideal for exercise (since they can handle sweat) or anywhere they might get hit with drops of rain or sand. You can even use them in the bathtub without worry of splashing on them (unlike most other over-ear sets), but be very careful not to submerge or drop them in the water.<br/><br/>If you don't need the water resistance, you can find better audio quality and comfort. For home listening, I'd suggest springing a bit more for a comfortable open-back headset set, and for casual listening outside the house, high quality earbuds (which I'd also suggest springing a bit more for) are still ideal. However, my problem with earbuds is that when exercising, my ear canals tend to tighten up and they become extremely uncomfortable. This set is built to stay on your head while exercising, so it can feel a bit tight after a couple hours, but the earpads have a soft "cooling gel" that is better than other sets I've used, and it definitely gets more comfortable after a short break-in period. As an added bonus, the pads are removable and the outer lining is washable (although they feel pretty durable, I'm curious to see how long they last). The headband has a strip of rubber to soften the pressure, but it does feel a bit too hard and some comfort improvements could be made there. On the other hand, it feels built like a tank - they're light on your head, but still feel extremely durable. Other bonuses include a standard audio jack as an option instead of Bluetooth, big sturdy volume control buttons that aren't a pain to use like most headset controls, and an insane battery that lasts ages (I got at least the manufacturer spec of 35 hours, using them 2-3 hours a day for nearly two weeks without needing to recharge).<br/><br/>These weren't the first pair of water-resistant cans I bought from Phillips. The previous version was the SH402, which I bought based on goodwill coming from their excellent X2 headphones I've used for years. These were an absolute travesty, with buzzing out of one side and audio quality that sounded like somebody playing music under a couch in the next room with the door closed, and I'd never returned something so fast. The A4216 set VASTLY improves on these, with very good audio quality. It's still not top-tier in the pure audio department or anything - it's a bit overly bassy with a hint of a muffled quality in the way a lot of closed-back headsets that are built to prevent audio leakage are - but it's more than good enough as a minor compromise to balance out the other benefits this set has (especially for the reasonable price), and again, if you don't need an exercise/water-resistant headset, you'd probably want to look elsewhere anyway. If you happen to be in that particular market though, I'm not sure you can really do much better than these.
----
Battery life is long, sound quality is great. The only negative I have is turning it off is never the same. I've learned to just disconnect my phone from the headphones and eventually it will power down.
----
Good headphones for workouts and cleaning the house. I love over the ear headphones and these are awesome for the price
----
So far so good! Was a little iffy but they have great sound. Drowned out the gym noise. The material for the over the ear part is perfect while at the gym! I really like them so far.
----
So far so good! I use them while I’m working. They have been just fine so far. Sound quality is pretty good and they seem to be comfortable
----
Good for the price

UPDATE JAN 2022.<br/>Sadly, I really would like to luv this headphones, but this is not the outcome of my experience.  After light use, always at home I got to say that my personal experience has not been a bed of roses.<br/><br/>PROS: Sound quality still really good.  The case is great to keep them out of dust, mine still might look as new but will tell more after.  Battery still lasting long.<br/><br/>CONS: it broke... still playing music but the pad on top start falling a part (I add an image). The presure on your head is still to much so I end with headaches or pain in skull behind my ears.  Bluetooth connection is ok but when I am away like 7 or 8 mts start having problems. Earpads still stiff and not very comfortable. I really wish I found a way to exchange those, but I haven't been lucky to find a video or description how to dismantle those pads from this particular headphones; Philips do not give any kind of support on that respect so bad point for that company. Cable to listen in high quality is flat and that is ok, but the connector is small so the cable bends to close and probably will be broken very soon (I think they could design something better)<br/><br/>In general I CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS PAIR OF HEADPHONES AND I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER PAIR IN THE FUTURE.  Even the sound quality is really good :-(.  I read from a guy who can¡t hear BASS on this, well,I disagree but probably he like those headphones with MegaBass systems which is not my personal preference.  Do not forget to use your equalizer to tune to your taste.<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br/>Perfectly packaged.  It is awesome to get this beautiful (THEY ARE REALLY GOOD LOOKING) headphones with the hard case to protect them and for travel. People has been complaining about noise cancellation but mine works perfect... the only thing I do not like much is between songs I can listen little hiss from it so I rather to use it off but when are ON really blocks all noise from the street which is the way should work. So when is rush hour I turn ON and peace came to my ears...<br/>I like to listen many music genera, from barroque, to Glam or some Heavey metal, blues, jazz, rock and people critizing headphones for bass etc.. but in general you have to tune for each genera your equalizer, but is not only for each genera but also for each pair of different headphones or speakers you are going to use.  For most people that is not an issue so is a personal preference.<br/>SOUND  of this Philips is good.<br/>I try talking on the phone, and people said that they hear me like I was in a bucket or something like that... but to me their voices are crystal clear, but looks like my voice sound different but I did not experience that they do not understand me clear so I think works fine.<br/>Construction, materials etc... are as good as BOSE or SONY, probably this ones are more confortable to me and this ones fit better to me, earpads are super soft!!!! really confortable.  The head pressure is little tight, not very disconfortable but makes me feel the pair of headphones on my head all the time.<br/>CONTROLS, I read some reviews about people having issues with their controls, well... READ THE MANUAL, is really easy and clear and works perfect as described by Philips.  I do not use google assitant, mainly because you just open your mic to let google hear you whatever they can  thru the mic (Probably they already doing it LOL).<br/>Another thing... Volume. Headphones have their own volume scale which is differnt from the source (phone, MAC or whatever u are using) so keep that in mind, try to protect your ears not listeing to high and learn to listen in lower mid volume so your ears need to be train for detailes (Just a personal sugestion).  So If you want high volume, pump up the volume on source and headphones.<br/>I will try to update my review after the summer to see how battery last, if starts to breaking apart or moving parts start making noise or something like that.  I hope this review helps you to decide to get this ones or not.<br/>Totally recomended, I got a great price, otherway I would finished buying some chinese cheap headphones.<br/>Bluethooth connection has been super relieble and can be around 10m (30ft) away from source in dofferent rooms.<br/>WOW, Bach start... got to listen this. Have a great day enjoy your music.<br/>**************************************<br/>UPDATE AFER A MONTH OF USE:<br/>**************************************<br/>Well, I wish I would like to fall in love of this headphones, but I am glad I had a chance to update my review about them.  After a month of daily use I got my list and why I decide to reduce to a 4 stars my review.<br/><br/>PROS: Battery is amazing, I only chaged once few days ago and the continue playing, will see how long the battery really last, then what is my question... Do I have to buy a new pair? Will Philips be kind to replace the battery?<br/>Sound still really good.<br/>Design is nice and most of the materials used are great.<br/>Connection has been tip top, no issues about it.<br/>I love that they came with the case, is really cool to have one with this quality.<br/>When I use with cable is also really good, and I do not hear the cable sound like on those small headphones that came with your phone.<br/><br/>CONS: The only but very important cons I found were the earpads, mine were really confortable the first week, after that I need to constant change position of the headphones to avoid pain in my ears or my head which is no good, probably I shoud give 3 stars only but sound is really good.  I do not know if I can replace those pads for different kind.<br/>The left and the right side have different shapes, left one has some bulky points on foam and are not cushing that well anymore.<br/>Material of pads is really soft, but because are leather or PU (fake leather) make them hot after long periods, but I live in a cold city so that is not a mayor concern.<br/>I don't know if pads are made of memory foam but maybe I might need different kind, probably for someone else works that is why I only take one star only, is a personal experience.<br/>If any one know how to change those pads I appreciate your comments and help.<br/>The pressure from the headphones itself is strong, so probably if you consider that you have a big head, I recomend avoid them, brand new are so soft but after days of using you will notice.  I would like to give a second chance if I can change the PADS maybe that helps in my experience using this beautiful headphones.

Pros would be that it does provide some noise cancellation, but that is to be expected with any set of over-the-ear closed-back headphones. They fit comfortably (thus far), and the sound is pretty nice for the price. A good balanced sound, with enough bass, etc.<br/><br/>The 30-hour battery life is a great claim, we will have to see if it lives up to it before I can give a rating on that, since I just bought it.  But that would explain the 2-hour charging time.<br/><br/>Cons would be- it came with an extremely short charging cable- less than 2 inches long?  Fortunately I had a normal length charging cable with exactly the same end and a charger, so it wasn’t a big issue.<br/><br/>Another potential con is the swiveling hinges on the ear pieces- this seems like a weak point in the construction, and after owning them for a long period of time, I can see them falling apart at these particular points. I know I’ve owned enough bluetooth headphones that the joints where they either fold or swivel are ALWAYS the weakest points in the construction- and I know I have replaced two units that were still working great as far as the electronics- pairing, connecting, playing great sound, etc- because the joints fell apart and I couldn’t physically wear them anymore.<br/><br/>I hope this is not the case with these phones, because I like how they look, and how they sound, and I have bought a hardshell case to carry them in to prevent unnecessary wear and tear from dropping them, spilling something on them, etc, etc.<br/><br/>I have owned other Philips products, including a Professional Series home theatre amp that I’ve had for ten plus years which still puts out great sound- and I’m hoping my confidence in the brand will not be misplaced.
----
The sound quality of these headphones is solid--- crisp mids and defined bass, not too tinny highs. The controls are very intuitive and easy to get used to, and they're comfortable to wear. I really appreciate the overall design, which is minimalist and simple with no shiny bits or excessive branding. A lot of headphones in this price range try really hard to look futuristic or "industrial", which often just makes them look tacky and less comfortable to wear. I like that these are just simple and utilitarian. The one gripe I have is that the construction doesn't feel especially solid--- not cheap by any means, just rather plasticky. However, I would still recommend this to anyone as a solid pair of headphones on a budget.
----
I was looking for a pair of headphones and I wanted something lower priced to start out since I normally stick to my airpods. Overall these are pretty comfortable, I have a small head so they do slip around a little but they cover my ears rather than sitting on ear uncomfortably. Having an actual pair of headphones is great and the sound is ten times better than my airpods, however, the sound leakage is very bad. If I take them off and push them off to the side, even when the volume is very low I can still hear this music. This isn't great especially since I bought them to wear around campus. So these certainly won't be replacing my airpods, but they're a good addition.

Being a crazy avid user of over ear headphones i've used many of the top spec products out there before, I had both the Sony XM3 and the Bose QC 35II and they were amazing. In need of a new replacement for my worn out QC35IIs I wanted to try something new but not break the bank. That's where I literally stumbled across these as they looked really similar at first glance to my XM3's. I never heard of Philips making noise cancelling headphones before and through a quick youtube search it seems like no mainstream youtuber reviewed these pairs of headphones either. I tried my luck and decided to give these a go and im definitely pleased given its price. Ill go over its pros and cons below and since im no audiophile knowing what's the right mix of highs and lows I will give my unprofessional opinion. Note that I got these for under 100$ because of a holiday sale. Take that in mind when you read the review and for the price you currently have.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>~ Great battery life, advertised as 30 hours and I got around 25-27 hours on mid-high volume.<br/>~ Quality on the band and the ear pieces are great. Didn't notice any creaking of the plastic or flexing that caused any housing to pop out.<br/>~ Fairly comfortable. The ear cup design and cutout definitely mirrors the XM3's, while these are not as good as the QC35IIs (which imo are industry leading in comfort), I would say they are actually slightly better than the XM3's. I felt the XM3's were more stuffy on my ear and the clamping pressure of the band made it uncomfortable to wear after 4-5 hours. I've been wearing these Philips for 6-7 hours at a time and I didn't really notice any major discomfort. Of course, each person's head shape is different and comfort varies upon the individual.<br/>~ For those who love bass, I think these were amazing, even slightly overpowering for me. They are comparable to the XM3's.<br/>~ sound quality is great, it sounds just like the industry leading XM3's and better than the QC35II's. I have been using my Airpods pro a lot and these are miles better in sound quality.<br/>~ noise cancellation works well for its price range.<br/>~ carrying pouch it comes with is well made and compact enough to slide in your backpack.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>~ the ambient sound feature is absolutely horrible on these headphones. For those who don't know ambient it lets you hear your surroundings better without you needing to take of your headphones. Even with these on I can't really hear anything outside. For reference, my AirPods pro ambient feature uses the microphones to enhance the outside noise and it makes it feel like you're not wearing earphones at all. These Philips do not do that at all.<br/>~ the microphones on these headphones are not great. I would not recommend using these when calling.<br/>~ the OK google tap function can get very annoying. every time I accidentally brush across the ear cup I activate the OK google function. Furthermore, I couldn't find a way to activate siri instead of google. Other brands at this price point offer this feature.<br/>~ Touch controls to control volume were very difficult at first to get use to. You need to do more of a tap than a swipe. But once you master this, then the volume controls work great.<br/>~ on my second picture, you can see that the ring of plastic changes to a more piano black which picks up scratches and fingerprints like crazy. I wish they used a consistent design throughout the ear cup.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say at my purchase price these were definitely a bargain for its quality. While it's not as amazing with fancy features as the top Sony and Bose headphones, I received these at a fraction of their price. If you see a sale of these for under 100$ I would go for it for sure!

Really good sound and build quality for the $100 plus price point  Loved the sound. ANC was great. They fit snug. The rest of the build quality was solid. They looked and fit great too. Another plus is the hard shell case that they come in. I would have loved to use this for travel.<br/><br/>But I returned these day one. Here are my reasons. No app from Philips. Just used the built in Bluetooth which relies on Google Assistant (Android). The touch control gets stuck between failing to pause/play and launching the very annoying Google assistant. Touch failed to work well even after disabling Google Assistant. Given I did not feel I could even pause playback reliably, this was a deal breaker for $150 headphones.<br/>Minor complaints:<br/> Had an issue where the manual control button felt like it could break in a few weeks of use.<br/> The fake leather made my ears uncomfortably hot after twenty minutes or so.<br/> No USB-C butt instead micro USB.<br/> Weird 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm jack. Cheap cable included for both the power and audio jack.<br/> Microphone recorded my voice very sub par compared to higher end headphones.
----
They're almost perfect headphones, I just wish they let me connect the mic through the aux cable and they didn't block the music for so long to tell me when I switch modes
----
Highs:<br/>- Excellent noise canceling performance<br/>- Really nice fit and finish, comfortable to wear<br/>- Excellent build quality and durability (hinges seem very sturdy)<br/>- Easy to use, with very functional touch control<br/>- Good design, not intrusive or overly flashy (sophisticated in my eyes)<br/>- Easy to connect and Google Assistant functions are great (i am using a Pixel 3A XL)<br/>- Updated firmware (auto prompted me this) upon connecting the first time<br/>- Versatile folding positions<br/>- Awareness mode (so I can be aware of the surrounding without having to take these off)<br/>- Super fast charging times<br/><br/>Lows:<br/>- Not the lightest but understandable with the quality of materials they are using<br/>- MicroUSB and not USB-C<br/>- Power button sometimes take a bit longer to shut off (have to hold down more than 3 seconds)<br/>- 2.5mm jack in instead of 3.5mm<br/>- Not the most bass heavy (this is both a good and a bad, depending on taste)<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>These are surprisingly a great pair of ANC headphones that performs just as well as the Sony WH-1000XM3, the gold standard in ANC headphones, while costing almost $100 less than the Sony! It isn't as functional when it comes to tuning its audio profiles but in terms of everyday usability and its ANC performance, it gets a 9/10 from me.<br/><br/>Build quality is amazing for a sub $200 headphone, the leather, memory foam, hinges, and even the paint on the earcups are textured perfectly so that these should last a good few years of heavy usage with no worries.<br/><br/>Audio quality is above average but it does lack the smartphone software that allows you to adjust the EQ and such on the headphones but I think this can be compensated by adjusting the EQ on the music player you are using. I tried playing some FLAC on a non-amplified line using the 3.5mm to 2.5mm cable that is included, it does a great job of delivering clear highs and mids without muddles from the bass. It definitely excels at the trebles, an indication that this is great for clear conversations too. And yes, calls are extremely clear when I use this for regular phone and VOIP conversations on my phone.<br/><br/>Connecting to the phone is easy once it is paired, turning it on does the job automatically. Pairing is easy too, hallmarks of a good BT 5.0 implementation. It even show a picture of the PH805 on my phone after I click on its name in the Bluetooth devices.<br/><br/>There are 3 excellent party tricks that makes this an excellent steal at $180 or so.<br/>1. The 3 ways that it folds: flat fold, curl fold, and flat and curl fold (where it fits in the pouch)<br/>2. Awareness mode turns down the music and broadcasts the environmental noise so that you hear whats around you easily and can carry a conversation with the person in front of you while wearing it, which is quite fun/funny but useful on commutes<br/>3. Google Assistant: I actually started looking at my phone less and less now that I own this pair of headphones. Having Google Assistant able to read back any text messages, even messages in Line app because that function is enabled when wearing this headphone means that I can focus more on work and not get distracted by the many other things going on on my phone! And having the touch control on the earcup, without any additional markings, is a great design in nature.<br/>4th bonus party trick: its touch control is really useful for turning up and down the volume, no more trying to find the volume rocker or buttons, just swipe at the right ear-cup and it adjusts the volume, although slowly.

I normally tend to shop lower prices and tend to think higher prices aren't that much better quality, I was wrong. My wife likes to fall asleep with the tv on and I don't so I play white noise with headphones to drown out whatever TV show she has going on. These headphones are so sound proof I normally don't even need to play a sound to block outside noise. If I ever do play a noise I can't even hear what's happening right next to me. The comfort level is amazing and could even fall asleep with them on if I wanted

<span class="cr-original-review-content">No sabía de lo que me estaba perdiendo, siempre he escuchado música en audífonos normales y "gaming"<br/>Estos audífonos están a otro nivel, sonido impecable, se puede decir que se escucha cada instrumento por separado pero todo al mismo tiempo, sin que uno opaque al otro.<span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden">

great  sound and quite comfortable
----
I thought they were broken the first time I put them on and plugged them into my keyboard. I thought the sound was still coming out of the keyboard speakers. In fact, they were just so good that it fooled me. Great value and a name brand.
----
Have been in radio for several years, the Sennheiser headphones phones have been long part of my equipment. Now doing a podcast, the Sennheiser headphones continue to be impressive.
----
Good quality, inexpensive, good sounding headphones.
----
I bought these to replace an older pair of Sennheiser headphones. They are the most comfortable over ear headphones I have used so far with excellent sound quality. That's why I gave it five stars
----
You get what you pay for. Decent sound with good volume. Construction seems flimsy (plastic, no braided cables), so I wouldn't recommend traveling with it. Cups just fit my ears, band is tight on my head. They wish great to hold me over until I can get something a bit more comfy
----
I bought these headphones to replace a pair of broken AKG and ended up liking these more. Pro headphones at a low price.
----
These are probably the best value in headphones in this price range. I use these whilst processing backing music tracks for my solo performances. Sometimes I need the 1/4" adapter. It was NOT included, although the listing on Amazon said that it was. It also lists it as included on the box. Other than that, no complaints. It did look like a re-pack, but the phones work fine.
----
Dollar for dollar I don't think these headphones can be beat.
----
I got them for $20 and they do feel cheap but boy do they sound good. Especially if you have a little amp to give them some juice that can really get loud. Even just off of the phone that they sound pretty good. Unfortunately that's about where the good part ends though the build quality seems really cheap and they're not that comfortable. If you're looking to get your first pair of sennheisers I would say go for it but if you have had a pair of $100 headphones these are going to be very underwhelming for you. But if you're someone who always spends $20 on headphones then these are worth $20.

These headphones had great noise cancelling ability! BUT it created an unbearable cabin pressure feeling in my ears. I've had other brands of ANC headphones, and never felt it as extreme as these. It was super uncomfortable no matter what was playing, gave me a headache, and also made me nauseous. So I returned and decided to get the newest version of the brand I liked, Soundcore.<br/><br/>I heard this is common for people with sensitive ears, due to how ANC tech works - using "anti-noise waves" to cancel out low frequencies, which can trick your brain into thinking the air pressure has changed. If you're not sensitive to those sound waves, these headphones would be great for you!
----
The ONLY real gripe I have is that in the Gym the Headband part slips a lot as do the Ear Bud part.  Not sure what the material is, PU?, but it will slip when you get into your workout and start sweating.... Small Stuff.  Overall not the greatest battery life BUT very good sound quality and the features work as advertised.  JP
----
The first thing I noticed when I put on these headphones was how good the Active Noise Canceling is. I never realized how much I needed ANC until I put these on. My spouse and I are gamers and have a smallish office that we have both our computers in. We also don't have central air, so we have a small window AC unit in here. With all the PC equipment and the AC, there was a lot of background noise that I've just been filtering out with my brain or with high volume on the headphones.<br/><br/>When my Skullcandy Hesh headphones got to the point where the 3.55 jack could no longer connect properly with any cord, I finally switched to bluetooth headphones, using the ones I used with my phones at first—Skullcandy Push and some Vivitar over-the-ears I picked up from Target for $10. The Vivitars had good battery life, but the Pushes had good noise canceling from just being in-the-ear. After a month of this, I realized I needed something better, some ANC.<br/><br/>I looked around, looked at pricing, looked at reviews, looked at many other brands just to hopefully find a good deal. There was always some dealbreaker. Slow charge. Expensive. Good battery life as long as you don't use ANC. I held off on looking at any other Skullcandy because, as I'm sure you've guessed, I've been a bit of a brand loyalist and I wanted to make sure I wasn't favoring Skullcandy just because it was Skullcandy.<br/><br/>Let me tell you, I favor Skullcandy because they actually deliver. I started buying them decades ago, because their earbuds were cheap and reliable. I bought the Hesh because they were less expensive than the other headphones on display yet sounded better. I got the push because they actually fit my ears and don't feel like they're so heavy they'll fall out.<br/><br/>The Venues look and feel extremely comfortable. They stay on my head even with rapid movement and don't need to rest on the top of my head. My Vivitars had a small headband that would touch my scalp and, after shaving the sides of my head, I found had actually been giving me contact dermatitis (aka a rash). The Venue headband doesn't need to touch my scalp at all to stay on. My scalp and mohawk are safe.<br/><br/>I got the Venues because reviews said the ANC was great—and it is. I can game in the same room as my spouse and hear him clearly over the voice chat without hearing him in the same room. Even with no sound playing, the ANC still makes it calm and quiet in the room. I'm tempted to start wearing these while I'm out just to have the ANC on normal outside sounds.<br/><br/>I got the Venues because reviews said the battery life was great—and it is. They arrived with no charge, but got enough charge in 10 minutes for me to use them with ANC for the rest of the night, which was about 5-6 hours of gaming with ANC on. I was using two headphones previously when I switched to bluetooth because the Push battery life is only about 4 hours and I would use the Vivitar while waiting for them to recharge. The Venues hold enough battery life on a full charge for me to use them all day while working from home, and then gaming for the night, all with ANC on and not needing to plug them back in at all.<br/><br/>Let me repeat this important point: The Venues last ALL DAY with a full charge, and in the event that they do run out, they will charge sufficiently in TEN MINUTES. And if you can't charge, there's still a 3.55mm jack for your audio.<br/><br/>There are other features of the Venue that I have not tried because they are not of interest to me (such as Skullcandy's partnering with Tile for locating devices, the hands-free call &amp; assistant integration, etc). I use these headphones as my primary PC headphones, not with my smartphone, so I can't comment on any of the smartphone integration features.
----
I bought these for my 14 hour flight to Japan in 2020. Then COVID hit and that never happened, but I have used these in many situations since. They've held up very well and still work flawlessly. The noise cancelling isn't the greatest, but for this price is probably good. Worth picking up on sale for sure. The battery has never died on me, even through days of using these for my job mowing at a golf course with noise cancelling turned on. Audio quality is pretty good but noise cancelling emits a high pitched sound that can be annoying if you're not playing any music or podcasts. The music quality sounds better with ANC turned off, and still does a good job of blocking lesser noises. The feature that lets you listen to the outside world is really nice, I just wish it didn't make my music so quiet. Noise cancelling helps when flying but if you're expecting these to remove the sound of an airplane you will be sorely disappointed. It just makes it a little less loud and a bit more bearable. They can get tiring on the ears after a while, but as far as headphones go are pretty comfortable.
----
Excellent sound and noise cancellation. The disappointment is with the lack of durability in the ear pads and headband fabric. I don't use them daily and this breakdown is inexcusable, having purchased them Jan 2021.

First this is an honest review from a regular old everyday guy. No one paid me or gave me free headphones. Period.<br/>I tested the Skullcandy Venue headphones side by side against the Bose QuietComfort 35 II headphones. Here are my impressions:<br/>Sound Quality. Much to my surprise I actually found the Venue's to sound better than the Bose', at least to my ear. The Venue's have a much rounder and more full tone and comparatively the Bose sounded a little thin so I give the edge to Venue on this one.<br/>Noise Cancelling. This one was close, again much to my surprise. Both headsets were able to do a good job rejecting outside noise. Although the Venue's had a very slight white noise with ANC on and no music playing but not enough to put me off. However the Bose' have an additional feature of a high and low ANC setting which could be useful depending on the environment that you are using then in. Slight advantage Bose on this one.<br/>Comfort. The weight of both headphones are within 4/100 of a Lb. (yes I weighed them) so weight is not an issue. The Venue headphones fit a little tighter and snugger around the ear which makes for a good seal but might be a little less comfortable during periods of long use or if you have a large head. On the other hand the Bose are just the opposite they have more head strap room than anyone could ever use and the cans are much bigger than the average ear. This provides some short term comfort but if you move your head quickly they can actually move around on your head. I'm calling this one a tie because this is just personal preference.<br/>Build Quality. First Impression is that Bose has a higher quality. Theirs include some metal alloy where the Venue's are almost completely plastic. I found the Venue's to be sturdy feeling and was not put off by the look or feel. I have to give the advantage to Bose here.<br/>User Experience. Bose includes no user manual in the packaging and basically requires you to download and install their proprietary app in order to set up and learn how to use their headphones. This offers the benefit of assigning a virtual assistant to a button. This is helpful if you use Alexa or Google but not if you use Siri because it comes pre-assigned. I found the app an unnecessary hassle with little benefit. Venue's on the other hand come with easy instructions and clear easy to use function buttons. Advantage Venue on this one.<br/>Value. In the end, nether of these headphones blew the other away in anything but price. So this one was a no brainer for me. These are both high quality headphones. The differences are much less than I expected and many of them will come down to personal preference. If cost is not a number one concern and you listen more to podcasts than music I can see how you might choose the Bose. I have other Bose products currently and the quality is generally very good but I cannot say that I ever felt that the price point was commensurate with the value of the product. Considering the quality I am finding in the Venue's and at 1/2 the price of the Bose, for me it's an easy decision. I am picking the Venue's. Your mileage my vary.

I'm starting off with mostly comparing these with my Sony xm3's, as these are mainly just a secondary pair for back ups.<br/><br/>Personally from the reviews that I was reading in comparison to my sony's for myself personally I do feel that the base on these is a little overpowering for some song selections, as I've mostly been so far listening to chillhop, rock, alternative rock, hip-hop, I've gotten just about the same sound from songs that have a emphasis on base, however the cost is that the base on these can overpower other portions of the sound as a whole, mainly the vocals in certain beats. Some complains I do agree with are that it does have some murky sounds on the lower end of things, but in general I would say for at least the selection I've listen to so far, these are actually pretty decent headphones.<br/><br/>These are also great for watching movies/videos, due to the profile of the sound these actually in my opinion do a great job of being able to capture a show as if your watching it in a movie theatre.<br/><br/>I personally think the build quality of these FEELS extremely cheap, with all things considering these were on sale for $100 dollars, the regular price on these is around 170. These feel like they can snap at a moment's notice if your not delicate with the band at all, as most of the band on the top has a cheap plastic feel to it.<br/><br/>The cups on these as far as it goes for prolonged use, I personally find them to be alright. I have giant ears all day, so I'm always going to prefer larger ear cups for comfort purposes, and although these are smaller than the Sony's I'm not feeling personally that these make your ears feel cramped at all. I was having these on for several hours today's without feeling to much fatigue from wearing them<br/><br/>I think overall with the fact I got these on sale, these feel relatively decent considering the sound profile of what I personally listen to, however I have heard some tracks get extremely muddied by the profile of these headphones, so I don't believe that these are for everyone. I do feel that $100 should be the regular price of these headphones, anything above that I personally feel is a rip off with all things considered.
----
Honest review. I just got these headphones, and overall sound quality is great. They are comfortable, With good cushioning and they're breaking in nicely.<br/><br/>-I'm big on aesthetic. They look good all around, though, the 'crimson' ascents are more of a reddish plum color. Definitely looks better in the photos.<br/><br/>-Didn't realize this, but it comes with a 3 month subscription to YouTube Music (though my card was already expired. Sent an email). I also got an email from Amazon saying this purchase is eligible for 3 months of Amazon music. So if you don't mind switching up music providers for 6 months of free music, there's a plus.<br/><br/>-The bass is alright, could be a little more prominent for what skullcandy likes to deliver. I used the Crushers for years and it's not a competition.<br/><br/>-It seems slightly smaller than any of my other headphones but good adjustability. Earcups are also a little small but my ears still fit cause i got small ears. This does, however, make them pretty light, which is a nice switch from my Logitech gaming headset.<br/><br/>-The active noise canceling is alright. Got to crank the music louder to hear nothing besides the music. Though there is a difference when ANC is on/off. Past like, 70% volume they are great ANC.<br/><br/>-The carrying case is also really nice and the headphones feel well protected.<br/><br/>One small thing to note. I'm sure if you're buying these headphones you've YouTubed reviews. One thing that I saw in many of them was that they don't like that they 'creak.' When I first opened mine and tried opening them up they did give off a loud creak, assuming since they've been sitting in a box for a while, but after that, I haven't heard any more. I even went a little exaggerated in moving around the paur and there wasn't much creaking. What they do in the reviews is ridiculous. No ones going to be doing what they do in those videos...<br/><br/>I do like Skullcandy, and I'm glad I got them for $100. I don't think I would pay $180 for these.<br/><br/>If you find them on sale, go for it. Otherwise be sure to look around for what suits your needs!

Sound is great! I am still working on learning how to use the headphones to receive calls properly but other than that! Totally recommended

These were my first pair of high quality noise cancelling headphones. And wow they really make a difference. For those with a budget of ~$100 like me (when these are on sale) you cannot beat them. The one problem I ran into is I think the noise cancelling technology is too strong for calls, because even with it switched off people had a hard time hearing me.<br/>My pair unfortunately broke (heavy use) before a year was up and I was very upset because I loved them. But skullcandy takes their one year warranty seriously! Even if you get them on Amazon on sale. I was so worried they wouldn’t accept my return since I didn’t have all the pieces but they accepted everything and gave me credit for the full price of the headphones (which I didn’t even pay!) so now I’m getting newer nicer ones worth double the price! Overall really impressed with skullcandy products and customer service.

I'll start by stating that I am replacing an older pair of active noise canceling headphones that I used for 5-6 hours/day for the past four years in varying office environments.  The old pair had a plastic swivel attaching the ear cup to the head band which finally broke after about a thousand times (literally, do the math) placing them into and taking them out of the case.<br/><br/>As I mentioned I use these headphones primarily in an office environment to listen to music (I'm a software developer) and/or to just block out the constant hum of HVAC systems, etc.  I've been reading countless of reviews on numerous headphones looking for something that fits my needs and after much consideration I settled on the QC25's.<br/><br/>The main things I took into consideration when looking for my replacement headphones were:  comfort, sound quality, noise cancelation, noise leakage, craftsmanship/durability, battery life, case, style, features (wireless/playback control/etc), and price.  Here's how the QC25 rates:<br/><br/>Comfort - 5/5 - These are the most comfortable non-studio headphones I have ever worn.  They are fairly light weight and have a large over-ear design.  The ear cups are also fairly deep so there's no contact between my ears and the ear pieces at all.  The cups rotate to allow you to wear these comfortably on your head however you desire.  The material on the ear cups is a soft foam filled leather that doesn't apply too much pressure to the side of the head (I wear glasses so ear comfort is of utmost importance to me).  There is also a foam filled suede material on the top of the headband making the headphones rest comfortably on your head.<br/><br/>Sound Quality - 5/5 - Excellent and well balanced.  If you're looking for headphones that just amplify the lows and the highs, these are not for you.  If you want solid lows, crisp highs and a pronounced mid-range then look no further.  These headphones play the music as-is and let you control any equalization you feel is necessary for your best listening experience.  I suppose if you're just into thumping base and are listening from a mobile device that doesn't support custom equalization you may be better off with a different brand.<br/><br/>Noise Cancelation - 5/5 - The first thing I did when I got these is pop in the included battery and walk into my furnace room (the furnace was running) to see the impact and it was profound.  These far outperformed my previous noise canceling headphones (which weren't too shabby).  At work I sit near a call center where there are typically 4-6 people on the phone during busier times.  There are also heat pump units in the ceiling which hum and buzz throughout the day (especially since the temperatures have been in the single digits the past several weeks).  The second I flip the switch on all of the humming and buzzing is gone without a trace.  The call center noise is also greatly reduced (I'd say about 70% quieter than without the headphones on) to the point that I have a hard time focusing on any one conversation.  This is of course remedied when I turn on some music and the awesome sound quality completely drowns out any remaining distractions.  I frequently have colleagues walk up and do jumping jacks to get my attention as I don't even hear them knocking on my desk when I'm "in the zone".<br/><br/>Noise Leakage - 4/5 - One of my slight disappointments with the QC25 is the level of noise leakage (the amount of sound that can be heard by people nearby).  At a comfortable listening level the noise leakage can be heard from 4-5 feet away.  If you like to listen to your music loud, expect people up to 10 feet away (in quiet environments) to sing along with your tunes.  I'm currently in a cubicle environment so the closest person to me is about 5 feet away, however at my previous office I sat 3 feet from another guy with no divider so it definitely would have been an issue there (except he wore headphones all day as well ;).<br/><br/>Craftsmanship/Durability - 5/5 - I only have a couple pairs of headphones to compare these to but they look like they are made well.  The joints and swivels are made with metal parts and are fastened with screws.  The headband is made from a metal ribbon surrounded by plastic.  The cup internals are covered with a rugged cloth (as opposed to the foam covering which often disintegrates after extended use).  The ear cups are a foam filled leather material that seems durable (same style on my old headphones and those lasted 4+ years).  Even the cord is made with sturdy gold-plated ends.  They flex well and seem like they would last a long time even on larger heads. (I had a friend who ate through headphones due to his large head).<br/><br/>Battery Life - 4/5 - So far the battery life on these is acceptable.  The noise canceling feature is typically on for 6-8 hours a day and I find that so far I've gone 2-3 days before swapping batteries.  I am also using some older rechargeable batteries which probably don't have the same life that they once did.  I have not completely drained a standard AAA battery to see how much life you get out of those.  The battery life is comparable to my old headphones (which is where the batteries came from) and is sufficient for my needs.<br/><br/>Case - 4/5 - The carrying case included with the headphones is sturdy and has a nice look/feel to it.  The headphones fold up rather small and fit neatly into the case leaving just enough room for the included headphone cable and maybe an adapter or two.  There is an elastic pouch on the back side of the case but it is designed more for storing your instruction manual or thin items (perhaps an extra cable?).  Because of my obsessive use of the headphones I own a small USB powered AAA batter charger which fit perfectly into my old case...when my batteries were low I could pull out the charger and charge a battery while my backup was in the headphones...not so with this new case.  Fortunately I almost always use the headphones with my macbook pro so I can keep the battery charger in my laptop bag when I need it.  Aside from that, the case is very compact and does include a little slot for a spare battery (one AAA is included) as well as an airplane adapter.<br/><br/>Style - 5/5 - I own the black design and I like them.  I'm not a style buff when it comes to headphones but I certainly don't want some big ugly things on my head.  These are sleek with an undertone of teal on the cups and on the in-line playback controller.  The plastic is a brushed style and I am overall very pleased with how these look.<br/><br/>Features - 4/5 - The only feature I was passively looking for in headphones that these don't have is wireless capabilities.  This isn't a show stopper for me, of course, since I came from wired headphones and I am typically always at my desk when using them.  Again, I do not use these while walking about listening to music from my phone or music player so I can't speak to that experience.  There are inline playback controls which consists of a small (1.25" long) control with three buttons.  There is a volume up button, a volume down button and a center button to control playback.  A single press of the center button will play/pause your music, a double-tap of the button will skip to the next track and a triple-tap will skip to the previous track.  I already have keyboard controls for this functionality but I imagine if listening to a music device (that supports inline playback controls) this would be convenient.<br/><br/>Price - 4/5 - Who doesn't want more for less?  For the quality and package you get the price is fair.  If you're looking for an exceptional pair of headphones with great noise canceling, great sound and decent features this is a great option to consider.<br/><br/>Overall - 4.5/5 - I would recommend these to anyone that doesn't mind being wired to their audio source and who doesn't mind anyone within their reach being able to hear what they're listening to.  I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase and would buy them again.

As a frequent flier, I depend heavily on noise cancelling headphones to get me through long flights, and I purchased these Bose headphones to replace an older Sennheiser in-ear set.  I knew what I was getting, more or less, because I had purchased a pair of QC15s for my husband a few years ago, and I had used those.  With my own headphones on a couple of transatlantic flights, however, I fell in love with these.  The active noise cancellation cuts out what seems like 95% of engine whine -- the sound inside the airplane seems deafening when I take them off.  That said, there's a decided difference between choosing an over-ear set and an in-ear one -- and, as much as I love these, I'm not sure I made the right choice.  Scroll down for more on that topic.<br/><br/>If you've never used active noise cancelling headphones, then it helps to understand what you're getting.  Active noise cancelling technology uses an electronic hiss, powered by a battery, to cancel out a specific noise frequency, one that is created by engine whine or other mechanical sounds.  These are not soundproof headphones or ear protection.  You can hear the voices around you, albeit muffled.  For instance, when the pilot comes on over the PA system, I can hear it and might even be able to hear exactly what's being said, even if I'm listening to music or a movie.  (I don't use a high volume, though.)  The kicker, though, is how much engine whine is filtered out.  Most people aren't aware of just how loud the inside of a plane cabin is -- and you won't, probably, unless you use noise-cancelling headphones.  Bose is unparalleled in noise cancellation technology -- my Sennheisers were good, but not this effective -- and, as a result, I turned these on without sound for a couple of hours just to protect my ears.<br/><br/>Although the audio quality is very good, I prefer other headphones while on the ground, mostly because these aren't as precise as some others that I own.  They do reproduce a full range, from bass to treble, though, so if you can only afford one set and need noise cancellation features as well as excellent sound, then don't hesitate with the Bose.  You won't find another headphone with this quality of noise cancellation, period, so you'll end up disappointed by compromising.  Flicking the noise cancellation on improves the sound, even without engine whine, by giving it more depth, although, again, the sound is fine even in regular mode.  Still, at the price, I wouldn't recommend these unless you need the noise cancellation.<br/><br/>The build quality is good, with comfortable padding around the ears.  The ear cups float on articulated joints to adjust to a variety of head shapes.  That said, these headphones pose certain problems for women in particular.  I cannot wear earrings, even studs, without some discomfort, and the articulated part over the ear cups sometimes catches my hair and pulls out a few strands.  Those of us with smaller heads don't get the same contact of the headphones against the head.  My husband tried on mine, and the cups made full contact around his ears while I had a slight, almost impercepible gap.  The headpiece is adjustable for larger heads. I have to use mine on the smallest setting. The inside of the ear cups is blue with huge R and L on the fabric.  It looks tacky but it's extremely useful, and I see it only when I first take them out of the case.<br/><br/>For those who are contemplating whether to get over-the-head or in-ear headphones:  in-ear models tend to block out more ambient sound.  They plug your ears in ways an over-ear one will not.  Bose makes an in-ear noise cancelling set (QC20) that I was considering before I bought these, and I now wonder if they would have been better for me since in-ear doesn't bug me the way that it does other people.  My Ultimate Ears in-ear set blocks out sound better, although not engine noise.  I went for the known quantity, however, since I had tried my husband's.  As I said earlier, I'm not sure I made the right choice even though I'm extremely happy with the performance of the QC25.<br/><br/>The case for the QuietComfort 25 is more compact that the one for the QC15, and so takes up less room in my bag, something I was initially worried about since space is always at a premium.  It comes with one AAA battery, an airplane adapter, and the detachable cable with in-line mic and music controls.<br/><br/>-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

I balked at buying the Bose, because I thought it was overpriced, and that probably all the manufacturers used the same generic digital signal processing chip. I've had two other inexpensive NC headsets, and thought they worked alright.  The first non-Bose headset, I had two of, because the cables kept fraying and breaking.  Can't remember the brand name anymore, but they were only about $35, so I thought, well, just my bad luck.  Replaced them with inexpensive ($50) Sony headsets, and the Sony cables are durable, but the sound quality and cancellation wasn't quite as good, to my ears.  Nevertheless, I kept the Sonys (and still have them), thinking again that Bose was just too darned expensive.  Then I saw one day in the classroom that I work in, that there were several Bose QC25 headsets that the school had purchased, so I thought, hey, here's a chance to see if they're really worth all that money.  The teacher let me borrow a pair, and as I left the school, I parked on the street, with my windows down, to listen to the car traffic go by, and try these out in an A/B test with the Sony NC headsets.  Wow!  It took me all of about 30 seconds to decide that they were worth the money.  One of the reasons, perhaps, that they work so well, is that the headset completely covers my ear, and the Sony headsets did not have complete ear coverage.  I've worn them for long periods of time, without discomfort, although if I wear them on the treadmill in the gym, they need to be wiped off from the perspiration on my head.  My first A/B test with the Bose QC25 was to put it on, without plugging it into any device, and just switch the NC on and off, as cars and  trucks passed by on the street.  The results were simple:  switched off, there was car noise; switched on, there was silence.  I ordered a pair immediately, and have been happy with them ever since.  They are great at cancelling droning noises, such as cars, or airplane engines, but not so good at nearby conversations.  I do use them when working in a library, and they do a fair job of cancelling out the noisy kids at the next table, but not as profound as engine noise reduction.  The big advantage I see to this model is that they use a single AAA battery, which lasts me about a week of listening to audiobooks, and the case has a holder for a spare battery.  A rechargeable AAA battery works just fine, and the later model Bose headsets use some sort of proprietary non-replaceable battery, which in my view is a deal breaker.  Your views about the bluetooth feature may make you think that the later Bose model would be better, but in my mind it's not, due to the many documented problems with bluetooth.  These wired headsets just simply work, with anything that has a standard audio jack.  The cable is not an inconvenience for me, and the easily replaceable AAA battery is a big plus.  As for the cable, when I unpacked the box and saw it, my first thought was that if these expensive cables fray and break, I'm going to be out a bunch of money to replace them.  Not true, you can buy generic replacement cables on Amazon, I did buy a couple, tried them, out, and tossed them into the drawer as backups, after finding that they worked just fine.  I got two generic cables for less than the price of one Bose cable.  My only advice as to these cables is this: they come in two flavors; one works only with Android and generic devices, and the other flavor works with Apple.  Make sure you order the correct one for your device.  I have used the Bose QC25 in place of my Plantronics bluetooth on my phone (android), and they work just fine, although legally I can't use them if I am driving, and must use my little hands-free earbud instead.  They also work fine on my laptop, and a little generic MP3 player.  The sound level is about the same in these headsets, with the power on or off, but they do sound a lot better with the power on.  In short, spend the money, they're worth it.

Although these headphones are pricey, they are well worth it. They are a marked improvement in sound quality and design from the QC 15's. Prior to the QC 25's, my primary headphones were the Bose AE2 headphones, which I absolutely loved. They sounded great and they were very comfortable, however, when in a loud environment the sound quality diminished greatly. With the QC 25's. this simply is not so. The 25's provide excellent sound quality no matter how loud it is around you.<br/><br/>Design:<br/><br/>The design of these headphones is absolutely superb. They plastics feel very sturdy, and they have yet to be scratched. I never worry about these headphone getting damaged simply because of how solid they feel. The headphone cups rotate to lay flat when around your neck, but they only rotate about half that in the other direction. This has never been a problem in any way for me. One thing that I really like about these headphones is that when I use them just for the noise cancelling, there isn't a massive gap on the side of my headphones where the cable plugs in. It does not effect anything except for the aesthetics. The outside of the headphone (with the Bose label) is made of some sort of metal, presumably aluminum. This also adds to the overall aura of quality that surrounds these headphones. Another thing that I really like about these headphones is that the headband no longer has leather wrapped on the top. While it looks and feels great at first, after a few years this leather starts to break down and flake off. Again, it's not the end of the world, but it doesn't look the greatest when it happens. The cloth on headband of the 25's feels very high quality and seems like it would be very easy and simple to clean, if need be. Although these headphones are slightly heavier than my old AE2's, even after 6+ hours I can barely tell that they are there. As is with all Bose around-ear headphones, there cups feel heavenly, and are easily replaceable. These headphones definitely feel like they are designed to last.<br/><br/>Sound Quality:<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, these headphone are a marked improvement in terms of sound quality over its predecessor. They don't feel "closed off ", as the 15's do, and they are definitely louder. When the noise cancelling is off the sound  quality definitely drops, but it is still better than a lot of headphones on the market. The biggest difference between having the noise cancelling off and on was the volume of the music. I would definitely recommend listening to music with the noise cancelling on, otherwise, what's the point? Overall these headphones sounds great. I am not saying that they are the best sounding $300 on headphones are the market, but they are way up there. An important note is that while there are better sounding headphones out there, none of them can boast the level of noise cancelling that the 25's do, and that is a huge deal when yours on a bus or plane, or somewhere generally loud.<br/><br/>Noise Cancelling:<br/><br/>When compared to the 15's you would be hard pressed to notice a difference with the noise cancelling. Not to say that the noise cancelling needed improvement, but if you're buying these headphone just for the noise cancelling you might want to consider the 15's if the $300 price tag seems just a tad too high. That being said, I love the noise cancelling on these headphones. They block out all of the low frequencies, and drastically reduce the volume of higher frequencies. The result is that you will most likely be able to have a normal conversation with someone while wearing these (no music of course). I use these headphones at work when I am down in the shop, and I never cease to be impressed by these headphones. When I traveled to London a couple years ago my girlfriend and I could have a normal conversation while wearing these (she has the 15's), when no one else could hear us. I also wear these headphones a lot in the car (not when I'm driving, of course), and they make a long car ride a heck of a lot more bearable. Also, as I mentioned earlier, the greatest thing about the 25's is that your music always sounds great, no matter how loud it is around you. When is comes to noise cancelling, Bose is the best.<br/><br/>Battery and Case:<br/><br/>As for the battery, I seem to get right around 35 hours on a AAA. The case also has a very convenient spot for a spare battery. The case is the perfect size, and it fits almost anywhere just perfectly. It is much better than the QC 15 case. It is a semi-hard case, which is good for finding a place to put it, and since the headphones are so durable themselves, the case definitely does not need to be hard.<br/><br/>Overall these headphones are great. The design, sound quality, battery life, cable and case are all superb. I would definitely recommend these headphones for anyone who loves music, and ever has to be in a noisy environment (i.e. everyone). This is definitely one of the best purchases, and I look forward to using these headphones for years to come.

Allow me to start by saying I'm not a headphone connoisseur. I'm not necessarily an audiophile, but I do love music and I have synaesthesia for what that's worth. I can't really be biased towards or against them as such...<br/><br/>I've never owned anything Bose related, and my only experiences with Bose have been limited to store tests and my grandfather's sound system. I have upgraded to these headphones from a pair of Behringer HMP100s 
<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/BEHRINGER-HPM1000/dp/B00062PN6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">BEHRINGER HPM1000</a>
 that have served their purpose well. (Yes, it's a significant jump) I have worked with pretty nice headphones before, some mid-end Sennheisers and the like, but never Bose.<br/><br/>I work with video and audio mixing/editing, as well as manage a podcast, so all I really look for is clarity and comfort. Needless to say these are very comfortable. They're soft while tight enough for them to feel like they're not going to fly off, so that's a plus for me. (I do tend to go out for runs, and the haven't so much as shifted on my head.)<br/><br/>So, as far as sound quality goes, without the switch on, they sound as good (If not better) than the Behringers, while sounding massively better with the cancellation and amp on. I'm noticing little nuances in music I have never heard in music I've not noticed (or been able to hear) with my other headphones. Though if you have the amp on, there are occasional times where I can hear a slight ticking with bass, but it's not consistent with every kind of bass I've heard, it's rather hard to describe. A lower-quality song with a more direct bass will case a slight rattle, but a higher-quality version of the same song won't have the same rattling. Also there is a small amount of sound-bleeding at mildly high volumes, but it isn't loud enough to hear outside of arm's reach. I'd say at 3/4 volume, the radius of being able to hear sound leaking would be around 6', give or take.<br/><br/>The cancellation: Alright, I always like things that have noise isolation. Isolation is nice, but I've only owned one set of active noise cancelling headphones and they were 'meh' at best. They wouldn't quite filter out road noise, while these will block out things like a generator running, construction noise, dogs barking (Provided they aren't right in your ear), and so on. I'd definitely recommend them on that basis alone. There are a couple of little quirks I've noticed with the cancellation, nothing dealbreaking or anything... like for example, if you're sitting in a car, and someone opens and then closes the door, the resulting 'whoosh' does seem to confuse the cancellation a bit as whatever I'm listening to will stutter for a second.<br/><br/>Comfort: I haven't noticed any sort of fatigue or unwelcome pressure even with glasses on. They are also secure enough not to fly off, even with rapid head movements. They also feel rugged enough to take a drop or two without shattering, and that's always a plus for me.<br/><br/>So, all that to say: As a first time Bose owner, I'm satisfied. They deliver on everything advertised, and met my expectations.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I'd recommend them to someone that's just looking for a minimal good pair of headphones for the price, as they are to meet a specific criteria. If you can spare the cost, enjoy music, and also enjoy quiet to the extent of considering them, I'd say go for it. If you're just looking for something expensive for bragging rights... well, that's entirely up to you.<br/><br/>A couple of things to note: if you have lower quality MP3s, you will definitely notice. And these do NOT play well with any sort of bass boosting. They have a good amount of bass on their own, but if you add in extra bass they may very well start rattling like crazy.<br/>Oh, and if you're the kind of person that tends to shout when you wear headphones, I'd approach with caution. With the noise cancellation on, it's pretty hard to hear your own voice. I'm softspoken, and never really talk loud to begin with, but I let some relatives try it on and that resulted in yelling worthy of a sports stadium... Then again, that's not really Bose's fault, and just a bit of a personal note.<br/><br/>I hope this helps. (If I missed something, I'll try to answer questions as best I can)

I was a little reluctant to buy these based on some reports that they fail for a portion of owners after short use.  But I decided this failure is probably due to using the carry case which is provided by Bose, which requires quite a bit of twisting of the ear pieces to downsize them for storage, coupled with fairly frail wiring. I opted to buy another carry case that does not require any twisting for storage, thinking this might prevent that issue. I'll let you know if they fail anyway. So far I have been impressed with them in actual use. I've used them on city buses and in the car while traveling as a passenger. The music quality is fine for travel, and the noise reduction is substantial.  On the bus, if I'm listening to music at a low volume, I can't hear bus engine or braking noise, cell phone chatter, or misc noises, but I can still hear the bus stop announcements ( I usually sit near the front of the bus). In the car, even with no music on, engine and road noise completely disappear, nor can I hear my wife cursing at other drivers, unless she's really screaming. She has to signal me with her hands when she wants to talk to me.<br/>I haven't had a chance to use them yet on an aircraft, but we are headed to Europe this summer, so will get to test them on the way out and back. I also carry my earbuds with me, which themselves are pretty isolating (though not attenuating); this in case I have the misfortune of sitting near a screaming baby. I'm sure the buds, plus covering the ears with the Bose will cancel even that noise. I really feel for babies on planes, they don't know how to clear their ears, so probably are in terrible pan with the pressure changes, but I definitely do not want to share their pain on a long trip.<br/>My only issues with the headphones: 1) The plug going in to the headphones, tends to pull out rather easily part way, this leaves the right ear without any music. I resolved this by taking the shirt clip off an older pair of headphones and putting this on the cord. 2) I find it a little tricky to get the door open on the phones where the battery goes in. Fortunately, the battery seems to last a long time, so you shouldn't have to change it much. Its also a little hard to read the tiny + and - markings to place the battery in the slot in the correct direction. So note which way this goes while you are in bright light, and memorize it in case you have to do it in low light.<br/>I've been using the headphones with my Sansa Clip, so far this has had more than adequate power to drive the headphones with no issues at the volumes I listen, which is not usually very loud, without any noticeable distortion. Of course with the Sansa, I don't have control of volume with the switch on the Bose cord, since its not an Android device, but I don't find this to be a problem. Haven't gotten around to trying them on my Nexus 7.<br/>I'm actually not a fan of the Bose home systems that I have listened to, they all seem a bit bassy, muddy and unfocused, but one has to notice that one of Bose major production items, aside from home speakers, is headphones for professional pilots. I think its fair to say they know noise attenuation. So far I'm glad I got these, even if they do seem a bit pricey. Will write a follow up review if they don't hold up, in spite of the bigger carrying case.

I bought these headphones in 2019 before traveling internationally to ensure I had high quality headphones for my flights. Now, when a lot of people hear the phrase noise cancelling, I think an unrealistic expectation pops into their head. They imagine being able to put a pair of headphones in and immediately erase all external noise. Maybe there are headphones that can do that, but I think the average pair just dims the external noise and cuts out specific frequencies as best as they can which is what these do. For my 7 hour flights, they dulled the roar of the plane and didn't feel too tight or painful, so I think the name QuietComfort holds up.<br/><br/>Since then, I have been using these almost daily though mostly without the noise cancelling feature. The fidelity of the sound isn't perfect which I suspect has to do with part of the design being devoted to noise cancelling, but unless you are a devout audiophile, I would expect these would get the job done for most people. The actual construction of the headphone has generally held up really well with the cord and headphone itself still being original. The headphone speakers themselves haven't blown out and still sound relatively crisp. After about two years of regular use, the ear pieces did require replacement since they were breaking, but I think that is a reasonable lifespan for pieces of foam with faux-leather sewn over them.<br/><br/>Design-wise I believe there is one flaw worth mentioning which is if you have longer hair (more than a couple inches on the sides) the swivel of the headphone will sometimes snag on your hair when you try and take them off which is uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Overall, if you need noise cancelling headphones that you can wear for extend periods of time, I would recommend these. If you need headphones primarily for listening to music without noise cancelling, I might seek out other options.
----
I give these headphones five stars, but I will say the battery wears out VERY fast. I was going through way too many batteries, and they are bad for the environment. I invested in a rechargeable battery set-up and the problem is solved. These headphones are a must for noise cancellation, such as on flights, or just in your home.

I ordered a pair in Black but received a pair in White instead. These headphones are so good, that I decided to keep the White ones. I did not know if I returned them, asking for the color Black if they may just send the White ones again. I highly recommend them.
----
SUMMARY: I've had these for a year, buying them during a sale for $110 + tax. Overall I'm happy and they make a big difference in during my constant travels (see below), but the cord is way too long and doesn't connect well, has to be placed just so to keep the audio from going mono or out completely.<br/><br/>THE GOOD: Regarding noise cancellation and sound quality it's great for my needs, which is mostly to quiet out the drone of airplanes/trains/cars when traveling and allowing me to enjoy in-flight entertainment. Some hums disappear completely whereas others are greatly muted, and sometimes I use them without any music to just cancel noise while I read or try to nap. I can't believe I put up with long flights without these before! You can somewhat hear what people are saying depending on the pitch of their voice, but it's definitely quiet enough to concentrate and comfortable enough to wear for hours. I haven't yet had issues with the ear pads or other material degrading as others have noted. I like the compact case and the adapter for planes with the double-plug audio ports has come in use, as well as the space for an extra battery (though I've just thrown a pack of five in the case so I'm not worried). Music sounds better with noise cancellation on than off, it's pretty poor when off.<br/><br/>THE BAD: the cord is too long and in my case doesn't connect properly. First about the connection bit: I have to insert and twist it just so in order to get audio out of both sides, otherwise I get just one side or none at all. And then once I have it right, if I make any sudden movements or even twist my head too quickly it's enough for the audio to go out (even though the cable is plugged all the way in.) I could probably have gotten a replacement from Bose for this but it annoys me to go through that process and I feel that products of a company that claims such a focus on quality should just work well and go through rigorous quality control. Regarding the cord length, I can't fathom why they made it so long, perhaps so you can sit on a couch and plug in to a receiver a few feet away? But in a more typical modern situation of plugging into your phone to listen on the go, you end up having to wrap it around yourself or thread it through your belt loops just to try to keep it under control. It's so long it's sometimes even tough to store it comfortably in the case. I'd buy a shorter cord aftermarket cord to fix this but then wouldn't have the volume controls, so I'm just living with it, oh well. I guess all future models are bluetooth anyway.

Great for watching movies in full sound when everyone else has gone to bed. Also great for anyone with hearing loss. Gives them complete control of their necessary volume without blasting everyone else out of the room.
----
These were ordered for my daughter as a Christmas gift to replace her 3 year old ones.<br/>We are currently awaiting a  replacement pair because they broke within 2 weeks.
----
Bought These headphones when they first came out and I absolutely loved them! So ofcourse I had to get my hands on them again!!! I like to wear these while working out! They definitely cancel out noise especially a gym.
----
Great sound at a reasonable price
----
The sound is awesome
----
Like the volume button on these so I'm not always swiping
----
Amazon needs to have the seller take this product off the website. It has a serious design flaw. I have had two pairs break in exactly the same place after light use for less than a year. What a joke. So dissapointed in the poor quality and I won't buy another set.
----
The sound quality is really good as is the noise cancellation these are really good headphones
----
DON'T LIKE THE SOUND, NEED TO TURN THEM UP TO HEAR THE VOICE , THEN WHEN SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS THEY ABOUT BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF, ALSO AFTER WATCHING A MOVIE WITH THEM I WIND UP WITH A HEADACH..
----
Screws just fell out of the right side and wouldn't screw back in. The place where you screw it in was broken.  and the base was completely rattled and busted!!!

First let me tell you I am an audiophile to max, I am very picky about sound quality. That being said I wanted a pair of headphones that would deliver when I am at the gym so I didn't rish ruining my other high end headphones that are not made for that purpose. These Underarour Sports Headphones, endorsed by Dwayne Johnson, impressed me more than I thought they would. They are durable, offer great ventilation for over the ear headphones, and most importantly sound AMAZING! The controls are easy to use for volume control, skipping to next track, answering call and so forth. My gym has a lot of backgroud noise but the noise cancelling in these headphones takes care of that and puts me in my own audio bubble while I am working out. Can't recommend them enough.
----
These are without a doubt the best headphones I’ve ever had! The bass with some songs and JBL headphones app eq is insane! I’ll buy the white ones next just to mix up my style these are my new favorite purchase I’ve ever made!
----
When I run with these, there is a continuous ticking/clicking sound coming from either speaker at anytime. The sound quality is not what I expected. Switching from mid-priced/range earphones to these expensive headphones, I expected much more.<br/><br/>They are also top heavy. When doing slow and controlled sit-ups, these headphones flop back and forth.<br/><br/>They fall off. Not sure if it's due to the top heaviness or the loose swivel portion of the phones but when I bench-press or lay down, they slip off my ears.<br/><br/>The auto-stop feature works when it wants to.<br/><br/>Excessive wind noise when running.<br/><br/>Random speaker noise that sounds somewhere between white noise and a dial up internet connection that only goes away when your cycle the power.<br/><br/>When doing full extension chin ups/pull ups, my shoulders smack the oversized headphones.<br/><br/>When setting up or moving my head ever so slightly on the standing calf raise machine, the headphones bang on the should rest due to their large size.<br/><br/>Overall, they fit very loose.<br/><br/>The only think I like is the long battery life.<br/><br/>These certainly aren't worth the original retail price of $300 nor the half-off price.

I went from the XM3 to the upgraded XM5 and I’m very happy with the new look and fit of the XM5. A bit more sleek and the sound quality is a bit better. My favorite part is the user friendly interface, the headphones respond better when using the right cup to control the volume and pausing or playing content. Very happy with the XM5.
----
Best headphones ever!
----
The noise cancelation and sound quality are like no other. The touch controls are kind of tricky at first but easy enough after some practice.

I’ve been very impressed with my Beoplay H95 headphones, which I have been using for about 2 weeks. For context, I am a classical musician and record my own music. When researching BT ANC headphones, I sought out experiences by classical musicians, or people who listen to classical music, as the needs are different compared to other musical genres. Despite an extensive search I did not find much in this area so I am posting some of my experiences as they might be of interest to others.<br/><br/>I use several different pairs of headphones, some for monitoring use in recording and editing, and others for sound checks and pleasure listening. It is unusual for any one headphone to serve all purposes! During recording, I generally use the tried and true and surprisingly inexpensive ubiquitous Sony MDR-7506 headphones for monitoring. Most agree that these are very detailed and help reveal all the “warts” during the recording process, which is essential. However, I feel their sound signature is very bright and frankly unpleasantly harsh so they are not ideal for pleasure listening. I also use some excellent higher end headphones including the Sennheiser 800s, along with the companion Sennheiser headphone amp HDV 820, for critical and pleasure listening, as well as the Audeze LCD-X headphones which I use as a reality check during the recording process as well as for pleasure listening.<br/><br/>With that context, enter the Beoplay H95. I purchased these for pleasure and convenience listening – as opposed to critical listening or recording - in a sometimes noisy home environment (lots of nearby heavy construction noise and leaf blowers nearly every day). I was seeking a pair of Bluetooth headphones with ANC that approached the higher fidelity of my other cans. After extensive reading of reviews of popular Bluetooth ANC headphones, for example Sony WH-1000XM4, Bose 700 and Apple Air Pods Max I decided to trial the Beoplay H95. Note that I did not audition these other lower cost headphones so I can’t realistically compare them to the Beoplay H95. However, I can compare the H95 to my higher end headphones and this may be of interest to some.<br/><br/>Now, for additional important background, my use case is probably different than that of other headphone users. I don’t intend to use full size headphones walking about outdoors – I use Apple Airpod Pros for this. I also don’t intend to use full size headphones with ANC on commutes or on planes. Again, I would use the Airpod Pros or an older pair of Bose wired QC20 earbuds for this. So – my use case for a full size Bluetooth ANC headphone is for use indoors, freeing me from the cable tethering me to my good rig, listening for pleasure in a sometimes noisy environment. Other than ANC, sound quality is of paramount importance to me. Other features such as phone calls, apps, control gestures, voice control, are of secondary importance to me.<br/><br/>I’ve found the Beoplay H95 sound signature to be very neutral and transparent. While clearly not as fine as higher end - and more expensive - cabled headphones, the sound quality that the H95 offers is quite respectable. The soundstage is fairly expansive, and while it may not be as wide or deep as the Sennheiser 800s (which is unusually vast) – the H95 soundstage is quite generous. This makes spatial location of different instruments, for example in an orchestra, better than in lesser headphones. The mid-upper frequencies are transparent and airy, and vocals, such as in classical art songs (e.g. lieder) sound very true and engaging. Instrumentals (piano, strings, orchestra) seem pretty accurate as well. Bass is tight and certainly present in sufficient quantity for classical music. It is not boosted or exaggerated as some might prefer for other genres of music. Recordings I’ve made of myself (i.e. me as performer) also seem pretty accurate. Of course, when I compare the H95 sound to my good rig, the difference is readily apparent – for example the Sennheiser 800s has a great deal more body, heft, clarity, liquidity, dynamic range and nuance where the H95 is a bit lighter weight, somewhat veiled, slightly grainy and compressed by comparison - but I feel overall the H95 does quite a very respectable job representing reality for a BT headphone.  Again, it is unreasonable to expect a BT ANC device to perform at the same level as much more expensive corded audiophile equipment. The H95 does come surprisingly close however!<br/><br/>I have noticed what some others have called out, that to achieve decent listening volume, I need to dial the H95 up to &gt;70% volume, which I feel is less than ideal and shouldn’t be necessary. For some softer classical tracks I need to dial it up to 90-100%. This suggests to me that there isn’t adequate headroom in the amplifier. The supplied USB-C to USB-A cable, intended for recharging the H95 battery, can also be used as a wired connection to a computer. In this case, the achievable volume is much improved compared to BT. I estimate that at 50% volume level in this wired setup is similar to 70-80% level in the BT configuration. A similar “boost” in volume occurs when using the supplied 3.5mm cable to the source, be it my iPhone 11 (with a lighting to USB cameras adapter), or PC. I believe the sound quality is also improved using the USB-A to USB-C cable, perhaps because the digital signal from the PC is bypassing the DA conversion in the H95. Another factor in the low volume output of the H95 via Bluetooth from my iPhone is EQ. Usually I have this set on “Classical” as that is the majority of my listening. However, I found that the EQ setting “None” (or “Flat” which seems equivalent) is still excellent sonically for my needs, and the volume is noticeably louder.<br/><br/>I did have occasion to use the H95 in a phone call, and the sound was quite good at my end. At the other end, the sound quality was good enough for a hard of hearing elderly person to carry on a conversation better than when we use my land line.<br/><br/>Regarding ANC – I agree with some other reviewers that while the dial on the left earpiece is handy for immediate control of ANC vs transparency, it would be nice to have a physical “stop” where it is obvious where the dial is minimized and where it is maximized. The dial spins freely so you have to judge based on your hearing to detect and set the desired amount of ANC. To be fair, they do offer audible tones instead of a physical stop, but you need to learn to “decode” the different tones. I found the ANC effective enough to minimize noise from construction next door through open windows, nearby washer/dryer noises, and even our land line ringing 3 feet away from where I’m seated was barely audible. Standing outside in my yard, a wood chipper being used 2 doors down was fairly noisy as one would expect. With the H95 on full ANC but without music playing, the wood chipper was about 80+% dampened, still somewhat audible. With music at low-moderate volume (~40-50%), the wood chipper was not apparent.<br/><br/>Other Notes:<br/><br/>- The dial on the right earpiece for volume is a brilliant feature in my opinion. Might be easier than APM's small knob. Incidentally, the small knob on the Apple Watch does control H95 volume when listening to Apple Music in an iPhone.<br/><br/>- H95 has physical shut off switch, unlike APM, although the H95 has an ultra long battery life (38 hrs with ANC on and 50 hrs without ANC) making this less critical.<br/><br/>- H95 has multipoint connection, allowing maintain connections to two Bluetooth sources, which means for example you can listen on one and make calls on the other<br/><br/>- H95 has two corded options, both provided in the box: 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable (analog), and USB-C to USB-A (digital).<br/><br/>- H95 has a real case, unlike APM. However, I feel it is useful mainly as a protective case at home, not practical for travel.<br/><br/>- The Bang &amp; Olufsen app is nice but not essential. I did not find the EQ options to be as useful as expected. I’ve settled on “Optimal” and have not found a need to change it. The variable option didn’t seem helpful or practical. The battery level indicator is useful to a degree, but due to the very long battery life, it doesn’t come into play much. On my PC Bluetooth section, the battery level is also indicated. The volume level can be adjusted on the H95 with the dial on the right earcup so the app is not needed for this. The app is a little glitchy on the iPhone – more than once even though it was paired (appears in Settings&gt;Bluetooth and music plays through) the app sometimes paradoxically cannot detect the H95. I had to delete and reinstall the app more than once. There is no app for computers (just mobile devices) but sometimes the Bluetooth connection on my PC is glitchy with drop outs.<br/><br/>Summary<br/>While it is not fair to expect that Beoplay H95 would perform at the same level as corded audiophile headphones costing much more, I believe that B&amp;O did right by most things that count to optimize fine sound quality. The only significant downside for me is the relatively lower volume level, requiring cranking up the volume &gt;70%. Whatever this suggests about the amplifier design and relative lack of headroom, it is not a deal breaker in my mind. And even though the H95 is much more expensive than every other BT ANC headphone currently available, for me attaining this high level of sound quality was worthwhile. Of course, each person must make his/her own assessment and decision based on their sound goals and personal financial situation.

 Like most, the cost of the Bang &amp; Olufsen Beoplay H95 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones kept me from trying them. I first bought and loved the Beoplay HX headphones but kept feeling something was lacking. I had to adjust the EQ regularly to “fix” the sound as it would sometimes be too harsh in the high end or the bass might distort a bit at high volume. Also felt the round ear cups were not ideal for creating a seal to allow the noise cancellation to do what it is supposed to do. The H95’s were still the ones I wanted, ever since I saw them announced but the cost held me back. Finally I had to give in and ordered them and I can honestly say I do not regret it. They are without a doubt the best sounding wireless headphones I have tried and I have tried many, many wireless headphones over the last two years. I currently own the Bang &amp; Olufsen Beoplay HX, The Air Pods Max and the Technics A800 Headphones. The H95’s blow them all out of the water, at least for me.<br/>Sound is subjective, everyone hears things differently but for me these have the best sound out of the box of any I have tried. I also tried models from Sony, Bowers &amp; Wilkins, Master &amp; Dynamic, Sennheiser and more. These sound so good, with incredible depth, detail, and the soundstage is immersive and clear. Bass is strong but not overwhelming. Those seeking heavy bass might be disappointed but I think it sounds just right. Others have said they think they don’t get loud enough and I can hear that, definitely older tracks that have not been remastered will show off the weakness in the recording but for me most everything I have listened to sounds awesome and for me they are loud enough. The noise cancelling is surprisingly good, especially when music is playing it blocks a good amount of outside sounds. No doubt some are better (like Sony or Bose) but these are up there near the top of the list. Also the build quality is the best, really beautiful looking headphones, starting with the aluminum case they come in, the braided cords that fit into the compartment inside the case (with leather snap straps to hold them) and the headphones themselves are made of premium materials like aluminum and leather and fold up to fit inside the case. The ear cup pads are held with magnets and are easy to remove and replace (like the Air Pods Max do) and the oval shape lends to better sound isolation and comfort. These headphones just feel like something luxurious on your head. They have a little more clamping force than the HX which some might have issue with but I found it perfect as the HX’s felt more loose and like they might fall off my head at times (although they haven't as of yet). The Titanium drivers allow for better sound than is found on the HX (which are still good, just not as good, especially in direct comparison to the H95’s). Battery life is very good, as expected, but individual mileage varies on usage, volume and ANC settings and such. And i do love the dials on the ear cups for adjusting volume (right ear cup) and ANC/Transparency (left ear cup). It’s a nice touch. The only fault I can really find with these headphones is the touch control can be finicky for sure, but usually works, and there are no wear sensors to stop/start playback when you remove/replace the headphones but since this feature doesn’t always work properly on some headphones I have used I don’t really need it. If price is not an issue, I highly recommend the H95 headphones…If cost is an issue, I still love the HX and they do have wear sensors, and they are a slightly more reasonably priced alternative, especially when on sale. I cannot say enough good things about the H95’s and the Bang &amp; Olufsen brand! I am spoiled now and will be hard pressed to use any other headphone! I haven’t even tried them wired as of yet, I hear they are great wired too, but I really only want to be free of wires, otherwise why buy wireless headphones? As they say “you get what you pay for” and I think these headphones are well worth it!<br/>Update: decided to try the H95’s wired and they sound simply  incredible! I’m truly impressed. You do have to use power when wired so there is that to take into consideration and that may be why the wired sound is so awesome! I would not normally use them wired but it’s nice to have as an option, especially as good as they sound. And as mentioned above, the cords are durable braided cords for longevity and endurance. A really nice touch! One thing I discovered: the assistant button is supposed to be a long press to activate your assistant, in my case Siri, but it did not work at all. It’s supposed to be a long press to activate and a double press to cancel or deactivate, so I tried the double tap and it worked to activate Siri, at least on my unit. So if you find the long press not working, try the double tap. (I don’t really use it that much anyway but it’s good to know it does work after all). Update: a recent firmware update has improved the responsiveness of the touch control, it will pause/play quicker than before with less of a delay in the sound starting or stopping. Still my favorite wireless noise cancelling headphones!

These are pretty awesome.  I am a headphone nerd.  I currently enjoy the B&amp;O H9i.  I settled on those headphones after testing around 8 other headphones comparable in price.  The H9i beat them all except for noise cancelling, which they do not do especially well.  I use the B&amp;O app and run essentially a V-curve EQ, moving the ball all the way to the right in the app EQ.  This really shows off the highs and lows of the H9i and I personally love it.<br/><br/>NOW - moving on the H95.  To get similar EQ, I move the EQ ball all the way to the right and slightly up.  Anyway, noise cancellation is greatly improved.  Not as good as the Sony 1000XM - which defy science - but much better than the H9i.  In case you are wondering, when I listen to my wife’s 1000XM3, I am always disappointed in the plentiful but inarticulate bass, lack of separation and other issues.  The 1000XM line is great if you are not a critical listener.  The noise cancelling is creepy its so good.  But the audio itself is nothing special.<br/><br/>The H95 carries a little more volume than the H9i.  The lows are still punchy and articulate, and the highs are true and clear.  The mids are perfect.  However this is the case for the H9i, but the H95 is a little better overall.<br/><br/>But what strikes me more than anything is instrument separation.  I’ve never heard it done so well anywhere and they are much better than the H9i in this regard.  Such a treat to listen to.<br/><br/>Yes the build and case are first class.  Expected at this price. However I wish the case did not say “steal me!!!”<br/><br/>NOW THE BAD NEWS.  I knocked off 1 star due to the following issue.  With my EQ settings, the songs Dire Straits "Your Latest Trick” (1:07) and Pink Floyd “Mother” were an issue.  These are “test songs” for me.  The H95 has light popping and cracking in parts of these songs.  Every other song I listened to sounded superb.  But not these 2, and I will probably run across a few  others.  Ironically, the H9i does not struggle in the least with these songs. VERY disappointing.  The good news is that the other 30 songs I tested went superbly.

I was very excited to use these as i've owned my Bose QC2 since 2019 and it was time for an upgrade. These headphones were the top of my list because... well.. B&amp;O, who can resist this brand and it's quality? I mustered up about a grand for these beauties, but the excitement was short lived. I work from home and am constantly walking around from my bedroom office to kitchen, bathroom, etc. any time i would be further than 10 feet from my computer, the headphones would start distorting. i can overlook this, no big deal. my biggest hurdle was sound when i was simply walking with my phone on me, in a meeting. the sound would just disappear for several seconds at a time. i couldn't justify paying so much money for headphones that would drop connection like that as i've owned airpods, bose headphones and have never experienced it. i did research, tried to update firmware, etc., but nothing helped.<br/><br/>sound is 11/10<br/>physical quality is 10/10<br/>connection is 7/10

From everything I've listened to these have the best sound quality of any wireless headphone - easily.  Makes my Sony XM4 headphones seem dark and noticeably lacking detail.  Previously Sony XM4s were at the top of most people's list for wireless cans.  Comfort-wise, the Sony's win (light weight and plus ear pads) but the B&amp;O H95 are more luxurious and have a tighter seal.  ANC is similar - both top rate.<br/><br/>Compared to my collection of wired headphones, the B&amp;O H95 falls just below my lower tier audiophile headphones:  Sennheiser HD600 and HD650, HiFiMan Deva and Sony MDR-Z7M2.  And noticeably below my top-tier headphones Sony MDRZ1R, beyerdynamic T1 2nd Gen, HiFiMan HE6se and AKG K812 Pro.  I never expected this B&amp;O H95 to challenge my best, but I wanted to see how close they would come.  Bluetooth just can't compete in a wired segment yet.<br/><br/>The B&amp;O H95 is very, very clear, has lots of detail, strong tight bass and textured highs.  I would consider it a mild to moderate V-shape which appears more pronounced because of the remarkable clarity they produce.  Sound stage is very good compared to my wired cans but the best I've heard in the Bluetooth arena.<br/><br/>For portable listening I still prefer my wired in-ears: Sennheiser IE800 v2 and Westone W80 v2 and W60 v2.  Even with the larger drivers in the B&amp;O H95, the clarity and quality of the Westone is better.  I actually consider my Westone W80 just a hair below my AKG K812 Pro and Sony MDR-Z1R (which are considered some of the best open and closed cans available right now).
----
Comfort, looks, sound, ease of use, and any other factor that matters, you cannot do any better!<br/><br/>This head set is just over the top classy, solidly the best.  Bang and Olufsen outdid themselves.  I have checked out the rest and can comfortably attest, that these are the very best headphones ever made.  Hands down.
----
Great sound &amp; controls. A bit heavier than other brands, but still comfortable to wear for long periods.

I bought the Beoplay H95 for listening to music so that's what I will write about. I agree with many others that these sound better than most other wireless headsets currently available. There is always personal preference, but this set has solid performance that's hard to surpass. The sound is well rounded with sufficient depth and clarity and an appealing stage. Most people are particular about bass, and what this set delivers will appeal to accurate bass enthusiasts more than to those looking for bass boost. That said, there is plenty of bass for everyone.<br/><br/>The app has an option to change the sound profile which made a pleasant difference to me as I like my sound more on the "bright" side. Likewise you can use this setting to make them sound as "warm" as your standard plastic phones. The H95 also support aptX which is an enhanced Bluetooth codec that made some difference on my Android phone.<br/><br/>The noise cancellation on the H95 is not it's primary strength and not as good as on my Bose QC 35, but then again the sound is remarkably better. There seems to be some buzzing at whichever level you set it to, but it doesn't affect the listening experience. On the other hand, the transparency mode is a very useful feature, although these days fairly standard on noise cancelling phones. The controls make sense, less physical buttons and two integrated dials that are easy to operate.<br/><br/>The H95 can be used as a wired headset, but to my surprise I didn't find a difference in sound quality between wireless and wired mode. Not sure what that says about either one. I did notice the low volume others have described, but it is definitely high enough for harm free listening and maybe that's what the makers intended. In any way, there is plenty of detail to make up for sheer volume. Battery life is so generous that I yet have to charge the set for the first time.<br/><br/>In my opinion the H95 is a product with a purpose and the premium materials definitely help to set it apart. I would recommend it to anyone looking for cultivated listening, but the lingering question is whether it delivers what you expect for the price. At the end of the day, this set is in a class of its own.
----
Every audio company puts a priority on what matters to them the most in order to save cost. The B&amp;O design and materials spared no expense, but the volume and clarity at high levels took a hit. I agree with other reviewers, the sound is very low and I had to listen at 70 percent to hit the music at enjoyable levels, however the vocals and other Mids took a hit.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the XM5s look cheap and no where near pleasing to the eyes. However, they sound phenomenal over the H95s. If you want to flex on audiophiles or those in elites of society then they are for you. If you care about sound more, than I say get the XM5s.

Noise cancellation, awesome sound quality! Also great battery life as well. Happy I made the choice of bang Olufsen H95!!!!! Ooh La La!!!

TLDR:<br/>Acceptable audio playback quality after you play with the equalizer in Logi Tune for video and music. Multi-device connectivity seems to work well. Okay fitment for large heads and normal ears. Mic is decent but is not great (even comparing against other wireless headsets). The materials feel cheap, but it is inexpensive. They probably are a good purchase if you are going to be gentle with them and would like a good bang for the buck option for a multi-device connected headset that actually works. They are not a good fit for my needs.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/>+Sound Playback Quality+<br/>In conjunction with the Logi Tune software, which you can download from the Logitech website, the sound quality can be pretty good. I am not an audiophile by any stretch of the imagination, but I have rather sensitive ears (more on that under the mic section) and have used many sets of wireless headphones and headsets to compare against. The audio is quite good for a headset that comes in at almost a third of the cost of common "gold standard" wireless headphones like the QC45 and WH-1000XM4. It is important to note that these do not have active noise cancellation for the audio playback. This means that I can clearly hear my HVAC system on the other side of my basement if the volume isn't very high on the Zoom call or music that may be happening. I can also clearly hear the clicking of my mechanical (Gateron Browns) keyboard as I type this review, which isn't great. More outside noises can be heard through this headset than my current Corsair Void Pro Wireless (meaning the passive noise isolation is better on the Corsair).<br/><br/>+Comfort and Fitment+<br/>I have a big head and ears. The ear cups hug my ears fairly well without feeling like they are compressing them. I recently gave the Microsoft Surface Headphones 2 a go and while the ear cups were fine, I found the band to be uncomfortable on the top of the head, digging into my scalp. These were much more comfortable. They are very lightweight, and the band sits on the top of the head fairly comfortably, though I wish it had some padding. The padding on the band is nigh non-existent. It is more just a fabric wrap around the plastic band. Because of that, depending on how these end up lying on your head, your comfort may vary. The adjustability was also nice for the ear cups, though the is no tactile clicks between levels and I prefer that to the smooth adjustment action.<br/><br/>+Multi-Device and Other Features+<br/>It actually works. I was able to easily swap between my laptop which had the dongle plugged in and my Android phone which was connected via bluetooth. This is nice and one of the reasons I am in the market for a new headset for use when at home. It is nice to be able to switch between my work laptop with the dongle for Zoom and Teams calls and then seamlessly go back to my phone for Spotify. There is no perceptible audio latency with video via bluetooth or the dongle. Another huge plus (to me) is that the sidetone setting in the Logi Tune software persists through reboots. You don't have to go turn it on each time you reboot your laptop. This is my biggest gripe with Corsair iCue and the Corsair Void Pro Wireless. Every time I boot up, I have to open iCue and turn back on the sidetone, which is ridiculous.<br/><br/>+Packaging and Accessibility+<br/>I feel like companies should be doing more when it comes to sustainable materials and thinking about users that are often marginalized. Logitech definitely spent some time on this with the packaging being entirely paper based sourced from FSC-certified forests. They also have braille on the L and R designations, which is a little detail, but is a very thoughtful touch (pun intended).<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/>-Microphone Quality and Sidetone Hiss-<br/>The mic is not terrible, but it isn’t anything spectacular either. It is comparable to my current Corsair headset, but there are two shortcomings which are problematic to me. The algorithm being used by the active noise cancellation for the mic rolls off a bit more gradually than is desirable. This manifests when you first start talking and your voice "fades in" with the first couple words you say before being full volume and sounding normal. If you are just monologuing to a group of people, that wouldn't be problematic, but when starting and stopping speech often in a meeting, I feel that this makes it hard for people to understand because the first couple words are always way softer than the rest of what you say. It also makes it hard to get a word in when someone else may be speaking, as your attempt to interrupt is quite soft. The other thing I have found is the soft hissing that seems to be introduced when the sidetone is enabled. I love sidetone, as I am a very loud individual, and it helps me regulate how loudly I speak into the headset which reduces meeting fatigue and just makes me sound less like I am yelling to myself in my office. The subtle hiss is super harsh to my sensitive ears. The irony is that I typically associate that type of sound more to early implementations of ANC on audio playback (not mic pickup) and there is no ANC for audio playback on these headphones.<br/><br/>-Materials and Build-<br/>I like the fabric feel and it does not get quite as warm on the ears as leatherette type materials. I also like that the look is very understated with no flashy colors or lights on the device. The problem is the plastic frame of this headset. This is a plus due to the very light weight. What isn't a plus is that it feels fragile and cheap. There is a difference between cheap and quality plastics (ex. WH-1000XM4, which still have some material weaknesses which you can find in reviews). These are clearly in the cheap camp. I know that these are a third of the cost of the Sony headphones, but I firmly believe that I would break these if I was using them on a regular basis and this is not throwaway pricing. This is probably my perception due to my oversized head. I am stretching this frame a bit more than I feel is safe when putting them on and taking them off. Maybe a smaller head would result in fewer concerns? If you have huge ears, you should also note that there is no padding or covering on the inside of the ear cups, just straight plastic. I have somewhat big ears and don't touch the drivers directly, but it may be uncomfortable for someone with bigger ears that touch the bare plastic.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>Honestly, these seem like they would be a pretty good headset for folks with normal sized heads, that would result in less wear and tear when putting them on and taking them off. I really wish that these had ANC for the audio playback. That is probably one of the several sacrifices made to hit this aggressive price point. The hissing sound would probably not be noticeable or impactful to people with "normal" hearing. I am the kind of person that is bothered by the subtle coil whine from the regenerative breaking and/or electric motor(s) of the Pacifica Plug-in Hybrid which literally made me have a hard time focusing during a test drive. The Logi Tune software is simple, but effective. It also does not require some account with Logitech to function (bravo Logitech!). Perhaps Logitech will update the firmware (It updated when I first installed Logi Tune) on this headset and fix the hissing and the "fade in" effect with the ANC on the mic. That would definitely take this headset to the next level.

Tldr:<br/>Great sound quality, good retractable microphone quality, multi-device bluetooth connection, included RF dongle does not require extra set up, configuration, or pairing, just works like cable connection, all plastic build, neat bag to carry headphones and all extras.<br/><br/>Device has following claims listed on the box:<br/>* Dual mics with noise-canceling designed to suppress background sound<br/>Voice quality is good, it sounds natuaral. I recorded myself and verified with other people on few calls.<br/>My assumption is that constant buzzing sounds are eliminated with noise-canceling, something like a vacuum cleaner or AC working in the background. It is not working well for noises like typing on noisy keyboard or furniture squeaking.<br/><br/>* Generous 40 mm speaker drivers deliver deep bass and crisp high notes<br/>Device has Bluetooth 5.2 support and also can connect wirelessly to the included 2.4 GHz dongle. In both cases I was impressed by sound quality. I can’t find information on aptx support. I tried to play FLAC files while connected to the PC and tried streaming service on mobile. In both situations the sound was great.<br/><br/>I observed few unusual things (most likely this is specific to my computer):<br/>1. I plugged the included RF dongle to the usb-hub and the indicator light up red. Sound quality was terrible. I connected the dongle to the motherboard USB and the issue was fixed, sound was crystal clear. Indicator turned to white color. My assumption is that if it is red, it means something is not working properly with the USB port.<br/>2. When bluetooth connection was used my computer decided to use some default low-quality mono codec, the sound quality was bad. I fixed this by selecting high-quality AAC codec in the computer audio setting.<br/><br/>* Seamlessly switch between computer and smartphone via bluetooth or connect via 2.4 GHz included dongle<br/>I believe multi-device features are only supported when bluetooth connection is used. I didn't test it for all use cases, but I was able to connect to PC and smartphone simultaneously. It does not play both sound sources at same time, it plays one or another. If one device starts playing, it takes precedence and another device goes on pause. If a paused device start playing, it takes precedence and another one go on pause and so on.<br/><br/>* All media controls on earcups. Flip the mic boom to mute. Adjust EQ with Logi Tune<br/>Buttons are easy to use, there is no any type of touch controls. Mic can go up and down, it goes on mute automatically when in a folded position. Built-in voice inside a neadphones will tell you when you are on mute. There is also a small button on the retractable boom to go on mute manually. Logi Tune software available for Mac and Windows. I tried it on Windows 11, and it worked well. You can update firmware there, change mic volume, mic transparency (how much of mic signal would be mixed back to headphones), equalizer settings, and some other useful things. I would suggest downloading Logi Tune, at least you can update firmware there. Right now I am using headphones on a Linux computer and there is no need for extra software at all.<br/><br/>Some extra observations:<br/>* Build quality - good. It has cloth-covered ear cups and overhead band. Entirely build from plastic. There is very limited padding in the overhead band, but headphones are so light, I doubt it is necessary.<br/>* Logitech included a good quality cloth bag with a tiny pocket for wireless dongle. You can store charging cable and headphones in there. Very nice.<br/>* Wireless lag. Due to my previous bad experience with bluetooth devices, I was expecting terrible lag when connected via bluetooth and no lag when connected via RF dongle. It seems like the situation is different. There is lag when connected via bluetooth, and same or even more lag when connected via RF dongle. It is an acceptable amount of delay for conference-call conversations, and watching videos on mobile, but it is not good for fast-paced games and when you are watching videos on a big screen (you can clearly see lag when looking at the lips of the person talking).<br/>* There are no pads to cover the speakers inside the ear cup. Speakers are hidden behind a plastic wall with holes in it.<br/>* It seems like the overhead cloth band is non-removable. Earcups most likely can be removed, but I didn’t want to try to avoid damaging them in the first week of buying.<br/>* Compared to my wired headphones, I need to keep Zone 125 on higher levels of volume. For example wired headphones are set to about 40% on my computer, but for Zone I need to go all the way to 70%.

I bought this headset with the sole function of working from home and drowning out background noise while the kids where home for the summer.  This thing is really light weight, and works great with MS Teams -- I can mute and un-mute myself in meetings remotely by swinging the mic up or down.  The range of the device is a little iffy when using the USB dongle.  Sometimes i can be 15 feet away and it will say dongle disconnected and have to come back and turn the headset off then back on to reestablish connectivity.  Other times i can walk 30 feet away and still hear everything.  The light weight material is really comfortable for all day meetings and it doesn't make your ears hurt by having 'buds' in them all day.  The cons on the material is that it feels cheap and seems to be flimsy or easily torn.  Overall, this is my favorite headset for work and i do not game so I cannot attest to that.  I'm coming from the Logitech G933 Artemis Spectrum headset, and that headset was great other than it being a heavier headset and designed for gaming.<br/><br/>I would recommend this product for anyone who works from home and need something for meetings, but needs to walk away from the meeting and still be able to actively listen a few feet away.
----
I really like them. They are light and the sound are great. The only complaint that I have is if I listen my music really loud then people around me can listen to my music.
----
This is a good simple headset.  I wish it blocked out more noise, but it works. It is very comfortable though. I gave it a 4 because I had to return my initial one, it started to get a rattling in the left earphone, but it still worked.  Sound quality is good, and the flip to mute mic feature is good.
----
Sound quality: When the headset is connected without a microphone event, it plays nicely. When an app accesses the microphone (Zoom, Discord, etc), the headset swaps over to a handset profile and the quality of sound drops drastically. I was hoping the dongle would avoid that but it does not. Maybe it uses Bluetooth for the back end of the dongle and converts it to a generic sound device for the computer.<br/><br/>Quality: It is decently built. The plastic feels cheap but it also makes it really light. Moving parts feels fine so all the pressure feels even on your head. Earmuffs does press against the back of the ear if you have larger ears. It does feel uncomfortable. I had some leftover earmuffs from a HyperX Cloud headset that I put on these. It is loose but it makes it so much more comfortable.<br/><br/>Software: Logitech is kind of split-brained for their software. I have a c922, Litra Glow, this Zone Vibe 125, and an MX518. There is a strange vinn diagram of what the Logi Tunes and Logitech G HUB software controls.<br/>Tunes will see and support the c922, Litra and Vibe 125. G HUB will support the MX 518, c922 and Litra. I wish one software could support all of them.<br/><br/>I'll keep this headset and use it for my work computer. Sound quality isn't as important there and it is a lot more comfortable than my wired headset.

Somethings that the product says is true.  It has a decent microphone, though noise cancellation was hardly noticeable as background noise was still picked up.  It was only made better with adjustable voice pick-up setting and its comfortable to wear.  The microphone drop down is convenient as well.  I didn't test the Bluetooth as I had no need for it.  The wireless feature is nice, however, I've had issues with updating.  The headset couldn't update once and asked for me to check internet settings although my internet is working fine as I'm playing online games at the time.  I factory reset, as I thought maybe the first update went mostly through and failed and screwed something up, and after the reset I noticed occasional sound static through the headset and I can't update it to fix it.  I have to power cycle the headset to fix the static.  Any good points go out the window though as, when I had it working, the audio was crisp for media, but when I get in chat situations, whether it is an online service or even a call, the quality drops drastically, like I'm on a landline phone, even the background media.  My friends on discord think I'm talking from the year 2012 and it sounds the same back, which I didn't have this issue with my previous headset.  I tried using a different online voice chat and it helped my voice quality to my friends, but not the sound quality coming back.  I can't tell if it could be better with an update because, like I said before, it fails updates every time I try.

Could not be more impressed with this product! I hardly ever write reviews, but I figured this one was worth the time. Here's some of the things I really love:<br/>- this thing is INSANELY LIGHT<br/>- noise cancelling mic and audio drivers are incredible for under $200<br/>- Love the USB A dongle option<br/>- When you're on a call, the mics turn on and give you a "transparency mode" so you can actually hear yourself<br/>- A small thing, but the position of the ear cups are really easy to change<br/>- And lastly, of course: "Climate Pledge Friendly"<br/><br/>Just can't sing enough praises here. Logitech products never disappoint.
----
Very light weight and comfortable. Quality sound but it's not great. I like the convenient physical buttons. Neat mute feature with the mic. Perfect for an office environment so I'll keep them and use it there. Only downside is the pricing. At $130 I know I can find better sound quality, with more features and even get some noise canceling<br/><br/>I do get with it being fabric over traditional that something will be loss but these feel more $90 and under. But if lightweight in a wireless headset is what you're looking for. You can't beat it. This is the headset for you.
----
Lightweight, comfortable… can be worn for long periods of time. Excellent blue tooth pairing and ideal for those needing to use for phone and video meetings. Music and other sound do sound great. Very good headphones for the price.

I'll be comparing these to my experiences with mid-level Sennheiser headphones, which I replaced with the Sony this time because Sennheiser is bad about not supporting their products (which I have grown tired of). I did not get these for noise-cancellation, so I will not be reviewing based on that (however, they do mask background noise better than my 598s, including the sound of my Cherry MX Brown mechanical keyboard and my CPU fans, if that is a factor for you).<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- The bass response is exceptional. That's not necessarily a good thing for ear health, but if bass is important to you, the MDR1AM2s bring it.<br/>- The packaging is impressive, right down to the custom-fitted shrink wrap, but I had to damage the outer sleeve on the box to get it open, so it might make returns problematic.<br/>- The cans swivel flat, making them relatively easy to store and to pack in a laptop bag. They would make excellent headphones for a traveler.<br/>- They are lightweight. I'm not sure how that will bode for long-term durability. I'll have to get back to you in 5 years.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- The over-the-ear design is too tight for my liking.  With my Sennheisers (598 SE), I could forget I was wearing them. I can't with the MDR1AM2s. I find myself frequently adjusting the left can for proper fit. Nipponjin must have small ears compared to Germans.<br/>- The leather-style earpads make my ears sweat.<br/>- Although I expect the frequency response to improve once the drivers break-in, out of the box, the high frequency response is lackluster at best. By comparison with the Sn 598s, they sound more hollow. Note: I do expect this to improve over time, but as to how much it will improve, that has yet to be heard.<br/>- The included headphone jack does not fit correctly with my standard extension cable. I had to nudge the plug out just a bit to get the sound to come through correctly. I'm not sure at this point whether replacing the cable with a different one will alleviate that issue. So far, it hasn't been a major problem.<br/>- Any movement of the cable will carry through to the cans, interfering with the sound quality. So if you are working at your computer and have to move your head, even a centimeter, you will hear it.<br/><br/>Conclusions:<br/>- They're good, but I liked my $94.00 (on sale at the time) Sennheiser 598 SEs better (until the OEM earpads wore out and I couldn't get a comparable replacement because Sennheiser product support leaves something to be desired).

Had an old pair of Sony MDR-10R headphones for the last decade or so. I loved them, they still work and produce great sound. However, the cushions had long since worn out so I figured it was okay to replace your headphones once every 10 years or so, was just scared of getting something worse than what I was used to. Read the stats on this model and it had good reviews, so I said I'll chance it.<br/>HOLY COW these headphones put those old MDR-10R's to shame! Quite literally the best sounding headphones I have ever had, to include the 2 previous Sonys. I cannot believe how much better they sound. These have an oval, snug fit around the ears which I prefer, my son didn't like the fit as he is used to the completely round fit of his headphones. Quite honestly the fit is the only point I can imagine someone complaining because the sound is just phenomenal

cant beat this for hi-res music
----
I just might by a second pair. Seriously, they are that good....  I have been on a spree of buying headphone for awhile now trying to find a pair that aren't lacking. Proper bass response without destroying the mids and highs.... and then still having said mids and highs.... these fit the bill! I am blown away at the sound quality. For the money, they compare to headphones that cost twice as much. I had a pair of HifiMan Sundara's which are about the same price (50 bucks more) and these make the Hifiman headphones seem like a cheap gimmick.... The sound stage exists and yet they are closed back... but when you have media that is spacious (some songs, games, movies) you can feel the size. Its not AS LARGE of a sound space as open back headphones, but its not as tight and "close" as closed back usually are. These are seriously my favorite pair of headphones, ever.... Don't get me wrong, if I had the money, I would buy the Sennheiser HD800s Reference.... but those are like 1800 bucks.... these are a paltry 300 bucks and sound in my opinion almost as good, but not quite. As I said I have been all over the place headphone wise, beyerdynamics, other sony's, hifiman, audiotechnica, and these particular sonys put them all to shame....<br/><br/>I have the sound blaster AE-9 with upgraded OP-AMPS (which will soon yet again get updated this time with MUSES instead of burr browns), which I then use the RCA output into my headphone amplifier.... I have used both the sound cards headphone amplifier and my own via RCA, and I prefer the RCA, its more pure, better low end, better mids, and better highs.... I use the Schiit Magni Heresy, yeah the one that is driven by op-amps! The combo is insane. I can't wait to hear what MUSES do to the sound quality from top to bottom....<br/><br/>I want a second pair of these, so I can leave one at my desk, and have the other for bed. I'm too lazy to simply walk them from A to B over and over again. but they are so good in quality, its kinda worth having another pair....
----
Let's start with what I can say for sure: the are the best sounding and most comfortable headphones I've ever used, full stop. If you want the best possible sound quality and the most comfort these are the top of the heap. I'm using these with an Xperia 10 and FLAC music, HiRes end to end, and these headphones do the high quality audio justice. I've been a music fan all my life and have lived through record, tape, CD, compressed audio, etc and nothing has ever sounded as good as these with HiRes music. These headphones are also extremely comfortable. The pads are a super soft fake leather that is as soft as skin or a flower petal or velvet, it is extremely soft. The head piece is also coated in soft fabric. And the headphones are so light that it is shocking when you first hold them. You can listen to these for hours without fatigue.<br/><br/>Now, let's get to what only time can clarify: I don't know how durable these are. As I mentioned they are so light that it is shocking, but that lightness makes them feel cheap. On closer inspection they are made with high quality materials. What feels in places like an all 0lastic body is in fact metal in many places. The metal is simply so thin and light it feels lime plastic. That said coming from a pair of Master &amp; Dynamics these feel very light and brittle. Only time will tell. At first I thought they were cheaply made but like I said over time I've realized that they are actually very well made, just with an emphasis on lightness. That said, I know I'll have those master and dynamics in 10 or even 20 years. How these will fare we can only wait and see.<br/><br/>Ultimately I recommend these highly. My priorities are comfort and sound quality and these do the trick. These don't have features that reduce quality like Bluetooth or noise cancelation so what you are paying for here is premium audio quality, not xoensive extras that make your music sound worse. These paired with HiRes music and a player are as good as it gets and the first true improvement I've heard in audio quality I've heard in my adult life.

Incredible headphones. Probably my favorite closed back Headphones ever under $300. Better than the original MDR1A's, better than the ath-msr7, ath-m40x &amp; m50x, ws1100is, Beyerdynamic dt770, akg k361 &amp; k371, Samson z55, status Audio cb-1, Takstar pro 82, JVC harx700 &amp; harx900 and countless others I've owned and heard. Better than all. Comfort is amazing and their super light. The only con I can think of is their build quality. I wish they had slightly more metal in their construction but then again they wouldn't be as light. If you take care of your gear though these will last for a very long time. These are super stylish and sexy looking on top of their cloud like comfort. They come with a nice travel pouch although would have been appreciated if they came with a hard case instead. I purchased one seperately. For sound as I said they are the best I've heard under $300 and trust me when I say I've heard easily close to 100 if not more different models under $300. Bass is extremely detailed and impactful. Could be slightly faster and decay quicker but none the less it truly is incredible. It doesn't bleed into the mid-range like the original MDR1A's did. The mid-range is slightly recessed in the upper mid-range but the lower part is thick, lush and full. Very good. The upper mid-range as I said Is slightly recessed but still maintains nice detail and natural timber to it that is engaging and enchanting. Never harsh or sibilant. The treble brings nice sparkle the originals lacked severely. Great detail and a sense of air while maintaining some of the smoothest response you could ask for. It's extremely nice. Soundstage is not very wide or deep at all but brings a rather intimate presentation to it instead. Imaging is quite accurate but not the best In the price range I will say that but still very good. All in all these are the best in my opinion and you should have bought them yesterday.

After using these headphone for about 40 hours, they have become one of my favorites to use with the balanced cable attached to my Astell &amp; Kahn Alpha player streaming Tidal service. Very strong bass. Nice size soundstage. I have come to appreciate some albums even more just by the high quality sound these headphone produce. Personally, as good as the heavy Audeze LCD-XC, plus you can wear them for hours unlike the Audeze headphones. Worth the price. Nice to add to my small collection of headphones which well with the above player as well the Naim Untii-Star system. You will enjoy these headphones. I did find they sound much better using the Balance connection than the standard 3.5 mm.
----
I bought this head set after having lost my well used MDR7506. Seemed like a good upgrade, but I was quickly disappointed.<br/>I really liked the idea that the headset cable could be replaced if it was damaged. 3.5mm cables are cheap and so replacing a cable over a whole headset is ideal. While it never happened on my old 7506, it was a constant worry in my mind. Sony, however had a different idea. While the cable plug into the headset IS 3.5 mm... the back shell of the 3.5 mm is custom designed so that only SONY's 3.5 mm plugs will work. My 3.5 mm cable replacement went from $2 to $40.<br/>The jack on the headset to receive the 3.5 mm cable frequently hit my shoulder as I naturally looked around my work space. Not usually knocking off the headset, but for something that should help me work, I found the constant nudges distracting.<br/>While the sound quality seemed good and the headphone pads were comfortable, the headset jack and cable plug situation turned me off to paying $300 for the headset and I decided to return it. I have found the pair of the now discontinued 7506 and am very happy to have save $200 by buying the older (yet superior) headset.

Wow, that's all I will say.... ok well I will say a little about these. They are very light, so they can feel a bit cheap in hand. But they are constructed very well whith just all plastic parts but look very amazing and feel well made. Sound is simply stunning,  I have never listened to music that sounded that clear and balkanced. These do have low deep bass but does not overpower any of the other sounds like it can be hitting a very low sound and yet you can still hear the slightest highs crystal clear.  They are truly amazing,  and since they are so light they are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Ok so I will wrap this up with a ps4 note.... I have very high end 300 dollar gaming headphones that I tested side by side hooked up just to the ps4 controller, playing Call of Duty. And let's just say it went from playing a war game on the TV to being in the game in the TV. Completely blew my gaming headphones out of the water I am selling them know, no need fir them anymore I will use these for my gaming now and music. You will ve shocked at how fast these respond to explosions and bullets being fired it hits hard and deep punch bass but yet you will hear every shell cassing hit the floor! Sell your expensive gaming headphones and do yourself a huge upgrade to your gaming experience and buy these!!!

Very efficient, Clean sub bass, crystal highs. Light weight. My favorite part is these have a bit of a slow decay on some of the high frequencies, like cymbals. Once they crash you can hear them fade instead of just drop out. Deep bass is amazing for such lightweight phones. These are keepers for my collection. Really great with Rock and EDM. When I want to listen to older Rock like Bad Company, these are the go to Headphones.

I like that I can pretty much use these all day before I get a battery warning.  They are comfortable for the most part.  They don't fit over my ears quite as well as I had hoped to compete with a wired set of headphones I have, but they are far better than the other set of wireless that I have and there are no wires to get in the way after a while.  I would like the volume buttons to be a bit easier to find.  I keep mashing a sound button changing modes when I want to turn the volume up.  At the end of the day they do what they're supposed to, and they do it well.  The shipper wasted no time that I can recall getting the product out to me.

I use this headphone for listening to TV and movies via my Apple TV as well as through my iPhone via Bluetooth.  I haven't experienced any latency issues syncing with voice on the TV.  The sound quality is right in my wheelhouse, bright sound without being tiring, the bass is strong without being overpowering and it's able to reproduce seriously low frequencies.  Music, movies, games and TV are all really great through these cans.  I am a fan of Koss Porta-Pro and these cans have a similar sound to them, albeit without the wide open sound of the Porta-Pros.<br/>There is an issue I have experienced a couple of times with the headset appearing to be off, but it remains connected to the source device while appearing to be turned off.  The fix is quite easy, just plug them into the charger for a couple of seconds, which forces the headphones to power down completely, then I turn them back on and all is well.<br/>I have read a couple of reviews that complained about poor fitting, and I'm pretty sure I've figured out the issue... they're on backwards.  I had the same response initially, since all of my other Bluetooth cans have the controls on the left, I put them on that way and finally figured out the controls go on the right ear and the fit becomes perfect, no pressure points and very comfortable padding.<br/>These are not noise cancelling phones, but they do a little bit of sound isolation due to their closed-back nature, but don't expect a whole lot of isolation.<br/><br/>Money well spent.
----
Sound quality and noise cancelling are good especially considering the price.<br/>Battery life is great.<br/>Only downsides are the button placement and spacing is not ergonomic and the fake leather, or vinyl, coating started cracking and flaking after a couple days.<br/>Overall, I think great value for the price.
----
Honestly, this headphone aren’t bad but I wished I just made the investment in a better headphone…sound quality isn’t terrible…no noise cancellation available for this model…not foldable…sound options are trash…highs aren’t that good mids and lows are alright…headphone wouldn’t turn off on two occasions so I had to plug it in and for some reason it turned off by itself and all is well again…the system gets a little glitchy sometimes…nice cheap option but honestly an extra 20 could get u a better headphone with real noise cancellation from Sony and a better build quality…u won’t regret investing in a more premium headphone…fake leather is stripping already…I had these headphones for less that a month and it looks like I had them for like a 1 year+
----
Sound is decent for the cost.  Battery life is good.  But the soft leather-like covering is horrible!  Removing the headphones from the package tore the inner left and right padding because both sides were stuck to the molded plastic packaging. After using the headphones lightly, I noticed another rip on them.  I have other headphones from Panasonic and no problems with them at all.  May be a bad batch?
----
The sound quality is great but the material on the fabric isnt the best.
----
Sound is great but my product has started to show wear and tear after just a little use. I would like a refund please.
----
So, these headphones are extremely comfortable,<br/>(If you use them outside, I'd suggest you get mesh or fabric earpads because they get hot) heavy bass, not the best battery life but they come with a headphone jack so, I'm not complaining. There is a 30ms delay so they are great for videos and movies, don't Max out the volume because they get loud. Overall, these are good headphones on a budget.
----
Brand new right out of the box, and the material is literally falling apart. I haven't even set them up to test the sound! Yes, I know these are not supposed to be a high end product, but seriously, they should at the very minimum NOT be falling apart. I bought these headphones to listen to music while I bike on my exercise bike. I learned the hard way, that when you sweat, it will ruin the "cushions" that go over your ear. Sadly, that hard lesson involved a pair of high end very expensive Bose headphones. So, I bought a new pair, then I bought these to use while on my exercise bike. Yeah, I want expecting a solid high end pair of headphones, but I did expect them to be somewhat decent. I bought these about three months ago, when I was in the process of moving, so I never opened the box. Now of course, it's too late to return them. But hey, if the seller is reading this review, I would greatly appreciate it, if you would message me and allow me to get a refund.

These are great headphones for the price.  I wanted a cheap pair of headphones to watch/listen to movies on my laptop.  My laptop has great sound with great bass when listening to the built in speakers.  However, when listening with the ear buds I was using I lost virtually all the bass and even the sound volume was lacking on some movies. I don't care for earbuds but that's what I had.  I didn't want to get another cheap pair of the lightweight headphones as I've not found a pair of those that can deliver decent sound, last without breaking for any period of time or have the cord break off.  I decided to go with a cheaper pair of full size headphones.  Based on price and reviews, I decided to take a chance on these.  I was willing to spend a little more but after reading the reviews and looking at the features/details of the lower priced headphone options, I kept coming back to these.  So far I'm quite pleased with them.  They deliver an amount of bass I would not have expected from these headphones.  I think the key to these headphones for me (and maybe others) is to use them with a source where you can adjust the bass and treble.  The bass, while excellent, CAN be a bit "booming" (as stated by others) depending on the source.  It is times like that where having a source where you can  decrease the bass and/or increase the treble really helps.  Having an EQ of some sort on the sound source makes these headphones shine.  The build quality is "OK" I guess and on par with the cost.  I have some concerns on how the head-band will hold up over time.  It is somewhat thin (but flexible) plastic.  It's hard to say because there are some plastics that are so pliable that you couldn't break them if you tried.  But, there is really no way to know that ahead of time.  The other pieces of the headphones that concern me are the hard plastic pieces where the ear-cups attach to the head-band.  These are a hard plastic which I have concerns about breaking.  I've had full size, high quality, expensive gaming headphones break in this same spot before.  I'm always apprehensive about that spot breaking on full size headphones if made from hard plastic.  The headphones are comfortable even for long term use.  The cord is quite long but for laptop use I just keep it tied up with a twist tie.  A 1/4" adapter is included for use with a home stereo receiver or other devices having a 1/4" headphone jack.  One of the things I would have liked to have seen (as echoed by others) is an in-line volume control.  Being able to adjust the volume on the headphones or on the cord is a nice feature I wish they would have added.  The head-band is not padded and I thought I was going to have an issue with the comfort being it's just bare plastic.  However, I'm happy to say that after many uses, I don't even notice the hand band at all.  Some people may have an issue with it but for me the headphones are light enough in weight that they don't pull down on the headband enough to make it a comfort issue.<br/><br/>For the money I don't think you can go wrong with these headphones.  They provide very good sound quality and are a good choice if you don't want to spend a lot of money on headphones you're not sure if you will like.  I paid $13.xx for these which I think is a great price given that they are a full size headphone and given the great sound quality.  Pick up a set and give them a try.  The only people I see perhaps NOT liking these headphones would be those using them with a MP3 player or other device that doesn't have any bass/treble controls.  The bass might be a little much (booming) for those people but again, it depends on the sound source.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Very good sound quality.<br/>  The ear cups are deeply padded and comfortable even for long periods of time.<br/>  There is a single cord coming down from one side of the headphones instead of some models which have a cord from each side coming down.<br/>  There is enough adjustment to fit a larger size head.<br/>  Long cord.<br/>  1/4 inch adapter is included (for those that need it).<br/>  Look good.<br/>  Low cost.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Somewhat cheap materials (plastic head-band / hard plastic attaches ear-cups to head-band). Long term durability unknown.<br/>  No volume control on headphones or cord (you know this going in if you've read the reviews).<br/>  Bass is somewhat booming (can be mitigated using sound source with EQ or other controls).

I run a podcast and I was searching for an affordable solution that provided three key factors: Comfort, Clarity, and Compactness. The comfort factor was the most important because if you are going to have a few of your guests wearing these for an hour, they need to feel like nothing is there. Clarity for the quality of the sound and to make sure your guests hear themselves clearly. Compactness for a podcast that has to go to multiple places.<br/><br/>I tested these JVC HARX500 against the following: JVC HARX330, Monoprice Premium Hi-Fi Dj Style,<br/>Vogek On Ear Headphones with Mic, Tascam TH-02, Koss UR20, and Panasonic RP-HT161-K.<br/><br/>Here is how they stacked up:<br/>JVC HARX330: decent clarity and lower profile for over the ear headphones but they really hurt my ears because they didn't completely cover my ears<br/>Monoprice Premium Hi-Fi Dj Style: If this purchase was for just listening to music or doing something other than my needs, this would have been my choice. The set was comfortable, albeit a bit on the heavy side and the clarity was unsurpassed. By far the best of all. However, these headphones had a good seal around my ears and I was unable to hear ambient noise. As a podcaster, I need to be aware of A/C units running in the background and I was unable to hear mine when wearing this. For my purposes, I need to be able to hear things that the microphone may or may not pick up.<br/>Vogek On Ear Headphones with Mic: I tried these just to see if on-ear headphones would work. Not for the comfort factor. However, these won the compact prize. They could fold up to the size of my palm which was a bonus.<br/>Tascam TH-02: with all the great reviews, I thought this was going to be a winner. However, it was very bulky and didn't fit on my head properly. Good quality sound but still not great. So it didn't win the prize for comfort because of its weight. These however did fold so they could have gotten a bonus point for compactness.<br/>Koss UR20: These things were a beast. This means it didn't pass the compact test. However, the sound clarity was terrible. I was amazed at how distorted voices were. It sounded like every time I talked I could hear myself clipping and I didn't hear that with any other headphone.<br/>Panasonic RP-HT161-K: Decent slimmer profile but didn't pass the comfort test.<br/><br/>The JVC HARX500 met 2 of the 3 conditions I felt were the most important, comfort and clarity. After putting on these headphones, I just felt like I could easily have them on for hours without any worry of fatigue or my ears hurting. The sound coming from the speakers was true to self and was great for the price point. As mentioned above, it still allows some ambient noise to penetrate so you can hear background noise and isn't completely noise isolation which I needed. These fail the compact use case but they are still slimmer in profile compared to the Monoprice and Koss ones. I can overlook that for the top 2 needs
----
Excellent set of basic, no-frills, over the ear headphones.  Crank the volume because these things thump.  Good sound quality, no distortion even when the bass is blasting.  Cable is nice and long, making it easy to plug into a home stereo system.
----
Love these headphones. Really good sound. Fits nice over the ears and is comfortable over after long use.
----
they are great
----
These are not particularly great at anything, but for the price?  I'll take a dozen.

I purchased these because I wanted inexpensive knock around computer over-the-ear<br/>headphones.<br/><br/>I also own the JVC HA-RX700 o-t-e headphones as well and will include the specs and<br/>my observations.<br/><br/>The 500s definitely do not have the audio dynamics that the 700s present. The specs<br/>speak for themselves on these two models. Not as much bass and mid-range when<br/>compared to the RX700. The bass is okay for the price. You get what you pay for<br/>between the two.<br/><br/>The 500s are light weight and do not over burden the ears or the head. I have average<br/>size ears and they just fit into the ear pads. I have found the 700s, after an hour,<br/>to feel heavy on the head but still comfortable. The ear pads on the 700s are a bit<br/>bigger and fit around my ears very well.<br/><br/>The 500s does not keep out all the exterior noise as well as the 700s. Neither do a<br/>perfect job but the 700s due to having a better build and better audio dynamics keep<br/>out more extraneous noise.<br/><br/>I tried out the 500 and the 700 on my Blackstar HT-5R amp. Definitely much more dynamic<br/>audio with the 700. The 500 can't even keep up with the 700s ability to go deep into<br/>bass or reproduce the mids and highs.<br/><br/>Here are some specs to compare:<br/><br/>..... JVC .................. RX500 ............... RX700 ...........<br/>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>Driver Unit: .......... 1.57"/40mm ....... 1.95"/50mm<br/>Magnet Type: ...... Neodynmium ...... Neodynmium<br/>Freq. Resp.: ...... 10Hz-22,000Hz .... 8Hz-25,000Hz<br/>Sensitivity: ............. 105dB .............. 105dB<br/>Max. Input Cap: ..... 1200mW ........... 1500mW<br/>Ear Coupling: ....... Circumaural ....... Circumaural<br/>Ear Pad IS Dia.: ....... 1-3/4" .............. 2-1/8"<br/>Cord Length: ..... 11.48 ft./3.5m ... 11.48 ft./3.5m<br/>Weight: ............. 6.94oz./194g .... 11.64oz./330g<br/><br/>Accessories for both models include a 0.25"/6.33mm Gold plated Adapter<br/><br/>The RX500 are sturdy and well worth the $20 you might pay. I did notice that the 500<br/>has a thinner cord than the 700. What that means I am not sure.<br/><br/>I believe the 500s are discontinued so one can still shop  around and find a good<br/>closeout price. I paid about $20 American in January 2013. The RX700s, ran about<br/>$34.00 when purchased in June of 2012.<br/><br/>The RX700s are worth the extra $10 in terms of overall sound. If you feel you will be<br/>using the 700 for longer than an hour you may want to find some comparable phones that<br/>are lighter. Or you can do more neck exercises. Will more expensive headphones, $50-150,<br/>be more comfortable? I don't know. I would hope that would be the case.<br/><br/>I gave the RX500s four stars because of the price paid, relative comfort over an hour and<br/>the the sound delivered.<br/>------------------------------<br/>UPDATE 04/25/2014: The Rx500s are still going strong and still intact. No breakage or<br/>wearing on the cord. I use them exclusively inside the home on my computer.

I've had the JVC HARX500 -over ear- Headphones now for a week.<br/>What I wanted:<br/>1. Replace existing (in)ear-buds due to wear and poor sound quality.<br/>2. Be able to hear more bass, mids, treble...better sound quality.<br/>3. High comfort and stylish, as I commute on the train everyday to work &amp; school.<br/>4. Good price.<br/>5. Noise cancellation<br/><br/>I already own a pair of professional studio headphones (Sennheiser), which i've had for more than 5 years. But they are big and not for wear 'on the street' - I just use them for in the music studio.<br/>I've been drumming for 13 years -both in studios &amp; live on stage-, and I have high expectations when I listen to music, whether at home, in the car, or on my mp3 player (Phillips GoGear vibe). I need to hear it all &amp; it annoys me when the sound isn't right, like the basic EQ levels. I am always changing them to suit the song I'm listening to. I listen to a wide variety of music; from 90's grunge to temporary psychadelic trance to jazz and talk radio and everything in between.<br/><br/>That said though, I am a college student, so I didn't expect to be able to find something with high quality sound for what I was able/willing to spend.<br/><br/>I read pretty much all the reviews for the headphones in my price range and decided to get these JVC HARX500's. At first the 300's seemed enough but for $7 more you get the Neodymium Driver. JVC has always been a favorite of mine when choosing any music related electronics and I am, again, really happy with these headphones. The sound is well distributed between crispness and lower range. The structure is sturdy, yet flexible and not too heavy.<br/><br/>It meant all my expectations:<br/>1. Good replacement for my old in-ear plugs, and I will add that it probably will be a for any, as the over-the-ear provide so much more depth to the sound.<br/>2. I think the bass is really nice. Not too muddy or too much. The mid's are right on par, and the treble is cristal clear. If you have an equalizer, I suggest fooling around to find your own personal sound preferences.<br/>3. These headphones are really comfy. You can adjust them every which way and (like mentioned in other reviews) the 'muffs' can turn to fit your ears. They are not too big, so I can easily put them in my backpack, and on the train, or walking around they, don't say "look at me". The cord is too long for my comfort, but I just tie it up, and stick it in my pants/jacket pocket. The headphones also even keep my ears warm in the winter!<br/>4. The price is, for such a high quality product of its kind, really unbeatable.<br/>5. I can turn this bad boy up and not hear a thing when your talking to me, or other background noises like trains (stations), cars, buses. I just 'tune out' and enjoy the music!<br/><br/>In short, if your looking for these things I mentioned in new headphones...get this one and you wont be disappointed.

Wow!! Just received today. Don't know where to start. These are truly fantastic in every regard! I listen to all kinds of music and have owned expensive stereo systems in my car and home.  This review concerns using the HA-RX500's listening to music through my PC. I am very particular about quality.  I want to hear all the details in a piece of recorded music and want background parts at the right sound level in relation to the other instruments/vocals in a song. These headphones have AMAZING sound--not for $20--just amazing sound in their own right. I read a review that said they have better sound quality than a $120 pair of headphones, and I couldn't agree more. Sound is rich and full. Can hear all layers of all types of music.  Bass is very impressive as are the highs, but what truly impressed me, and which I have found lacking in two other sets of headphones I recently ordered, is the quality of the mid-range sounds.<br/><br/>The headphones are incredibly light-feeling on your head and the ear pads are soft and very, very comfortable.  The long cord is absolutely no problem and looks and feels substantive, unlike some other cheap, very thin cords. They are excellent at outside sound dampening.  I researched so many headphones for hours and bought a pair of JVC HAV-570 "Super Bass" headphones. Admittedly, they were only $13, but they had many of the same specs as the X500's, i.e., 40mm drivers, etc, but the sound on the X500'S is literally five times better, and this saying a lot, because I was mildly satisfied with the cheaper pair (which got four stars overall on Amazon).  However, wanting more, I purchased a pair of Audio-Technica ATH-M30 Professional Headphones through Amazon for $40. They lacked range and were tight and felt smothering when worn. They don't come close to the JVC X500 in sound quality. I returned them and was going to settle for the other JVC's until I saw these on Amazon).<br/><br/>I am not an expert at describing what makes for high sound quality but I know that when someone says, when describing headphones, that they hear parts of songs they couldn't previously hear well with other headphones, that means something, if accurate.  That description is absolutely true with these headphones.  It's not so much you will hear sounds that you never heard at all, it is that you will hear instrumental parts and vocals (such as some back up vocals), much clearer and stronger than you hear them with other headphones. I must re-emphasize that the sound from these headphones is incredibly rich and full, especially if your system has a graphic equalizer that you can admust to your particular likes.  You cannot go wrong with these headphones!!  I am almost in disbelief that they cost only $18, seem solidly made, are extremely comfortable and the sound will impress you to no end. They are heaven!

Tie up or hang up lose wireing as the spliter is a extra 5ish foot on top of the headsets wire.. not at all tough plastic joints are flimsy and if you have hair longer then few Centimeters it's gonna get pulled but of you can look past those downfall it has beautiful sound great noise canceling easy mute light weight works will with phones to and can be worn once you find a comfortable spot all day.... Just be aware of the downfalls
----
I use these for work. The sound quality is good and the noise cancelation is excellent. They are comfortable, though after an hour or two, my ears need a breather. The things I wish were different are the tangling cord and somehow the dial on the ear piece often lowers the sound to minimum volume between calls. I have to remember to manually increase the volume before answering or making the next call to avoid having to adjust it with the client on the phone.
----
I got these for my wife, but I tried them out, too. Keep in mind that they are not meant to compete with serious audiophile headphones, but in the $0-$100 range, they are top-notch. I have a pair of AT M40s and she has open-backed AKG K240s. These have a lot more bass and isolation than the open backs, but that's to be expected. I would put them on par with the AudioTechnicas. They have good clarity and are very comfortable to wear for long periods. Music is pleasant and offers the entire range of frequencies. I've listened to my wife talk through the mic and it is much, much better than most headphone mics, even beating much more expensive ones. The mic is clean and clear, and while it won't compete with a studio mic, would be perfectly acceptable for a live stream, or at the least, not annoying your friends in chat. We've noticed that the mic is very sensitive. If I try to listen to something on my phone while my wife is playing with her sister, and my phone is turned way down to the point I can barely hear it and is about 4 feet from her mic, her sister will say she can hear it. So I guess don't expect a directional mic if you have room noise.
----
Bought these as a quick replacement not expecting much but they are pretty decent for the price, sound range is impressive although the treble is a little harsh, great for gaming tho theyre comfortable enough to wear for a long time and make a good seal around the ear. mic quality is lacking somewhat.
----
Overall sound quality is pretty good and a big step up from my old headphones. Obviously, more expensive headphones could sound better, but at this price point, the Quantum 200s definitely deliver. These headphones are a huge step up from the old Sony studio headphones I was using before that had sound that was too flat for gaming. These headphones have really taken the fun up a notch, completely immersing me during thunderous gunfights, while also allowing me to pinpoint the softest of footsteps nearby. Despite not having active noise cancelation like some of the higher tier Quantums, these headphones are still extremely isolating, and drown out most exterior noise when sound is coming through. The flip up/down to mute and unmute the mic has also been great for multiplayer, though the foam windscreen comes off occasionally.<br/><br/>---------------------<br/><br/>Update: 2 years later the right ear speaker is having issues. It only produces sound if the volume knob is set to to a super specific level; otherwise it cuts out. The left ear speaker is fine. Probably a wiring issue, but disappointing since I was pretty gentle with the headphones and never even traveled with them. Anyway, overall value has definitely dropped, so updating my stars from 5 to 3. I enjoyed these headphones while they lasted, and maybe others will last a lot longer, but seeing as they had a 1-year warranty, I don't think I have any options left.
----
Terrible for gaming. I had a less expensive JBL headphone (not even meant for gaming) that was better than this. Cord is way too long, and the microphone feedback through my party is horrid. Adjusted mic monitoring but still need to lower the volume to a point where it’s uncomfortable to even play.
----
Sound quality is great clear and crisp, I love the mic up to mute feature. The only glaring issue is the cord is ridiculously short if your not using the splitter. I believe it less than three feet possibly only two and a half.
----
Easily in the top Headphones at and above this price range. Feels well built with attention to detail in design. Lightweight and extremely comfortable even if you wear glasses, which i do. The surround sound that JBL has created on their own is really amazing. I was able to orient myself with my eyes closed and just using game sounds. I tested them on Far Cry 5, Modern Warfare, and Hunt Showdown. Each of these games has a well crafted sound design perfect to showcase what these headphones can do and they DEFINITELY IMPRESS. These cans packing 50mm drivers do an amazing job of balancing everything from low lows to sharp highs. The flip up Mic allows me to easily mute myself in game and the volume control on the left ear is handy as well. The cord has a decent length but not so long that its a mess and it naturally stays untangled<br/><br/>Overall definitely 5 stars, love these headphones, definitely better than others in the same price range
----
These headphones did exactly what they said they were going to do and a little more. I have been using them for a while and they are not bad at all honestly perfect for what I use them for.
----
Loved the sound quality from the headphones. However, the mic picked up a lot of that sound so friends heard an echo.

I don't like earbuds and find most other headphones to be too large plus heavy. I love to listen to podcasts and these are ideal for that because they are comfortable. I wish they would make an upgraded version with a more accurate sound (for music), mic, remote, and detachable cable. I've gone through 3 of these because the cable sometimes get accidently snagged to things, messing it up. I would gladly pay double the price if they did this. Nevertheless, these are one of the best values out there.
----
I am hard of hearing and like that the "ears" on these swivel.  I just use for tv and youtube. I can put these on and flip the headphones out. This allows the sound to be directed to my ear but I can still hear the phone, doorbell, meowing cat or conversation in the room. Ear buds, over the ear phones or TV Ears block all that. They are cheap and don't last forever. I get six to twelve months out of them. Weakest point is where the wires enter the headphone.
----
I just bought a new set of these after about 5 years of using the last set. That's a lot longer then I expected these to last for the price. They aren't bad quality, and very comfortable. The noise quality isn't bad for the price, cancellation? Eh, it's okay. Again, for the price, these are great. Lasted many years and they do their job.
----
Bought this because Dad needed an over-the-ears headphone set that wouldn't interfere with hearing aids. He likes to walk and listen to music. He says it does the job but is "tinny", which sounds to me like it doesn't replicate the bass and is probably letting in too much outside noise. However I knew when I bought it that it was not a perfect solution, it was a low-cost option. He will probably replace it at some point but he's still using it so it can't be all bad.
----
My husband has hearing aids, and I didn’t know how he was going to be able to hear on our tour in Israel. Let me explain. The tour guide uses a ‘whisper’ microphone that the group participants hear by plugging earphones into their whisper device. How could my husband use earphones when he needed to have his hearing aids in place? Then I got this idea. He used these lightweight headphones with the whisper device, and he didn’t have any trouble or interference with his hearing aids! We had a great trip.
----
These headphones are quite a bargain for the price. Nothing fancy but lightweight and a really full sound with good bass. I've been using them for a week and already ordered a second pair for back up.
----
I purchased these headphones to use on an 11.5-hour overseas flight. They plugged into the plane's entertainment system just fine and I had two blissful flights. I'd always hated the cheap ear buds the airline handed out, and these headphones made my flights so much more pleasurable. The sound quality was great. For such a reasonable price, I was really impressed!
----
I only keep ordering these because I sit on them or step on them and break them. For my use, they have just the right EQ. Love that they are so light that I can fall asleep with them on in bed, even lying on my side with one ear piece pushing into the pillow.
----
I was not expecting these to be as good as they are at this price point. They have become my favorite headphones that I have owned. Exactly what I was looking for with the color scheme, sound quality, and minimalism.
----
These are great, very lightweight and pack easily.  Fit in my small carry on and work great they look pretty nice as well.

Updated Review #5 3/12/2022<br/><br/>Still great! No issues whatsoever. Price is currently $129, I'd do it at that price. No disconnections. Noise cancellation makes my window fan almost silent while not noticeably affecting sound quality. Can't hear the roommates. I'm in my own world with these on.<br/><br/>I use these for watching videos on a PC where I can EQ and raise the volume more than someone with a phone. I use them on my phone too, but my audio player has a way to boost the sound so that I can play them extra loud if I want to.<br/><br/>Updated Review #4 11/10/2021<br/><br/>Still working great after almost a year now, still comfortable. Still 5 stars. I use them every night for several hours. Still holds a long charge.<br/><br/>Updated Review #3 5/27/2021<br/><br/>Still working great, I love these things. Paid a little less than $100. Holds a charge great. Never drops the signal. Ever. I use them every night to watch movies and they're fantastic.<br/><br/>I am no longer bothered by the ear cups no matter how I wear them. Maybe they softened up a little. These are bad ass!<br/><br/>Updated Review #2 1/29/2021<br/><br/>Okay I got these headphones to fit comfortably. I hope I can explain this. Back to 5-stars.<br/><br/>I put the headphones on, then I swivel the cups forward, like putting more pressure near my temple (front of the ear), and less pressure on the back part of the ear (that sticks out from my head).<br/><br/>The mistake is trying to fit them evenly over my ear, or flat against my head. At least for me. The cups are simply too small (they should be bigger!). Making this adjustment makes them fine for hours. I have no discomfort and the sound quality is not changed at all.<br/><br/>I still think the narrow ear design is flawed (I believe I said "stupid" earlier), but the sound quality and price I paid keep these at 5 stars.<br/><br/>And I repeat, for better and louder sound on a PC, I recommend the FREE "Equalizer APO". It EQ's all sounds coming from your computer to the headphones and speakers. Also download another free program called "Peace" to control the EQ easier. Way easier.<br/><br/>Updated Review 1/19/2021<br/><br/>These are uncomfortable after prolonged use. I can watch a movie, but after that it is sometimes a bit painful. The ear pads are poorly designed and I am looking to replace them. They are too narrow, I really don't understand why they were designed this way.<br/><br/>Just looking at them tells you they are not made to fit over the ear of a human being. I just don't see how you can screw up that part of a headphone design. It's dumb.<br/><br/>I paid $99 for these less than two months ago, now they are $146. If I'd paid $146 I would definitely return them, but for the price I paid I'm hoping I can find better ear pads instead. They sound great and I like everything else about them.<br/><br/>I also may have found a way of positioning them so that they are more comfortable, but seriously why should I have to? I shouldn't even know I'm wearing them after a few minutes. What a stupid design.<br/><br/>-------------------------<br/><br/>This is my first pair of wireless headphones and I am very happy with them.<br/><br/>They sound so much better than the cheap wired ones I usually get, and I used to think they were pretty good! I didn't know what I was missing before. Now I can re-watch some movies with incredible sound!<br/><br/>I can see why some people will find the ear cup padding uncomfortable. I may end up replacing them, but if I adjust them over my ears right then I really don't have any problems. They could be a little wider though and I do have to move them a little sometimes. This is the only issue that could remove a star from my review, but like I said, so far I'm fine with it so all stars are intact.<br/><br/>The sound is very clear and they do a good job covering the entire frequency range. I use Equalizer APO for my Windows machine, so whatever I run through the speakers or headphones is custom EQd. That makes a giant difference!<br/><br/>The battery life kicks butt! They last so long I forget to recharge them. it's just not something I have to do very often :)<br/><br/>For the first few weeks I could hit the center of the volume "rocker" button and it would tell me how much battery life I had left. I can't get that to work anymore. No biggie though. It will warn me if there is less than 12 hours left anyways when I turn them on.<br/><br/>The noise cancellation works well. But really the full cup nature of these headphones deal with most noise without the need of electronics. If I wear these with no sound playing I can't hear much in the way of noise.<br/><br/>I could do without the button that handles the track skipping and pausing. I sometimes hit it instead of the volume by mistake and my movie starts over from the beginning. I use a mouse for that stuff so I don't need it. I just take an extra moment to make sure I don't do that. Maybe I can put some tape over it. A lot of people like this feature so I'm probably in the minority.<br/><br/>I paid about $99 for these and I am very happy. They could be louder on the phone though, but my music app has a volume boost that I can use. On the PC I can make them as loud as I want.<br/><br/>I love not tripping over the wire of my old headphones anymore, or rolling over the wire with my chair. Such an annoyance! Wireless is awesome!<br/><br/>The sound quality is very good. Wireless headphones downsample the audio before streaming to your ears, but with these I can't tell. They are also HD in that regard - they transmit a higher quality sound. And if you're really picky you can plug them in with the cord and get full sound. I can't tell the difference.<br/><br/>I had to buy a Bluetooth adapter so I got one here at Amazon. get Bluetooth 5! I had an issue getting all this to work, but once I figured it out they work great.<br/><br/>I did a ton of research before buying these. I look forward to watching movies and listening to music more now. I highly recommend them, they are awesome!

The sennheiser HD450 BT is the successor to the 4.50. it's an improvement in every way.<br/>Comfort.<br/>The 450 BT has a thin headband but it never dug into my head at all. This is all plastic but it's well constructed and folds to a very compact size. The one thing i wish is that the earcups were a smidge wider, but i can think of a number of people i know and who i had try these headphones on, of varrying builds and none of them felt comfort was an issue. Truthfully it isn't anything i can't live with and i am nitpicking, but also comparing to other headphones i own.<br/>The headphones charge via USB-C and also have an analog cable with a 2.5 MM plug for the headphones, and a 3.5 MM for your headphone jack.<br/>The codecs they support are SBC, AAC, APTX and APTX-LL. The latter is designed to sync the audio from a TV or movie with what you see on screen.<br/>Note; IPHONES AND IPADS DO NOT SUPPORT THIS FEATURE.<br/>noise canceling. The headphones do well illiminating the whirring from AC units, busses etc, but with Air Conditioners for example, you'll still hear the fan noise, though it will be reduced. These also don't block voices very well, though they passively block them out enough so that with music playing at low-medium volumes and higher of course, you likely won't hear any of these noises well. There are headphones that cost double who's ANC is not as good as the Sennheiser HD450 BT.<br/>Sound. You can customize the sound via the Sennheiser Smart Control app, available on IOS and Android, via a dot EQ. The eq implementation is 2 stars only because i am able to get a sound i enjoy with these and other Sennheiser products i have which also use the Smart Control app, but from a programming and customization standpoint, it earns a solid half a star.<br/>By default the sound has an emphasis on bass in all it's forms, but these are not muddy by any means. The mids are full and the treble is rolled off slightly, but fortunately all this can be refined to some degree with the eq. Theres still a veil to the sound if i compare them to higher priced models like the NAD Viso HP70 or Shure Aonic 50, but those cost twice as much as the $200 MSRP Sennheiser placed on these. that said, these have some real potential and if you use an app that has a multiband eq, you could really make these shine. AS is, they have a good sense of space for instruments to have separation and sounds in tv shows to have their place as well.<br/>Functionality.<br/>The Sennheiser 450 BT uses buttons for it's functions.<br/>on the underside of the left side of the headphone just above the earcup, there is a braille L to indicate left. The right earcup is where all the buttons and ports are.<br/>you have the analog adapter mentioned earlier, the USB-C port, on the bottom edge of the right earcup. The volume button has a dot on one end, that's volume up. the other side closest to you while wearing them is volume down. Details like this help when you want to use them without looking, especially because while the buttons aren't hard to use, they are a little cramped in some instances. Fortunately they're distinct enough that it shouldn't be hard memorizing each one and what it does. Back to the layout, the next button over from volume moving towards your ear while you're wearing them is a toggle which rewinds and fastforwards by flicking it it up for fast forward, and down for rewind. Fun fact, if you hold the toggle in either direction, you can scrub through the track bit by bit. perfect if you miss something while listening to a podcast or audiobook. some devices and apps don't support this functionality however. pressing inward on the toggle pauses or plays music and also answers and ends calls. next button up, right near where the headphone band connects to the earcup is an assistent button. This worked 100% of the time. I didn't need to set it up like i have to with some products. This is using google Assistent. on the opposite side of the right earcup from the assistent button is the power/noise cancelation button. You press and release to turn ANC on and off and hold for 2-3 seconds to power on and off. Hold for 5 seconds to place in pairing mode.<br/>These also support multipoint connection, so you can have them connected to a tablet for music and a phone for calls for example. If you have music playing on one device, and recieve a call on another device the headphones are paired to, the music will pause, and the call will come in. you can hold the function button for a couple of seconds to reject the call. IF you do, your audio from the previous device will start playing again.<br/>Call quality. While these headphones don't have a transparency mode available while listening to music etc, they do use it for phone calls. This is a wonderful feature because you can clearly hear yourself and your environment while on a call. Vital while you're walking or might otherwise be occupied. The callers i spoke with in most cases didn't know beforehand i was using headphones for the call. And they never ask me to repeat myself or if i were on bluetooth. while speaking with them i did every day tasks, washing dishes, talking with my birds, vacuuming etc. The people i did ask for feedback on how i sounded said they could hear these noises in the background, but the sounds didn't overpower my voice and they could always hear me clearly. I left my phone in a room most the time while i wandered through my apartment and it never cut out on the call or while listening to music.<br/>These are a fantastic buy. If you want a well built headphone that has a lot of features but doesn't have a premium price, this is the one to get right now.

This is my one day review of the 450s, I will update it one week, month, and possibly further.<br/><br/>One week review is in the middle, and the long term review is at the very bottom. \/  \/<br/><br/>Pros<br/><br/>*The biggest thing that these headphones have going for them is their sound. I am by no means an expert on audio equipment, but I know good sound when I hear it. These headphones are amazing in the sound department, now they're not the he1s, but if you buy them on sale, they're one of if not the best sounding headphones for the price that are Bluetooth. Heck, it even makes ads sound good.<br/><br/>*I believe there's an actual mini tweeter along with the main driver that helps with a bit of separation.<br/><br/>*The headset has active noise cancelation (anc). The anc could be a bit better, but it does an okay job.<br/><br/>*They come in white. XD<br/><br/>*They have the ability to be a hard wired headset, so if you wanted to, you could plug them directly in. They also automatically turn off when you plug the 3.5mm jack in. The 3.5 plug also locks in so you don't accidentally pull it out of the headphones.<br/><br/>*They use USB c to charge, this means one less cable to have just laying around.<br/><br/>*The entire headset is made out of plastic, but it's a very durable and good feeling plastic.<br/><br/>*I've seen some reviews about how the earpads heat up a lot for them, but these have stayed relatively cool, and haven't held a lot of heat.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>(Disclaimer: these may not apply to everyone that buys these.)<br/><br/>*The earpads are very cramped and not meant for people with medium to large ears. You can buy aftermarket earpads from brainwavez and some other brands that can fix this issue. I might order some in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>*The connection via aux is secondary and Sennheiser designed these headphones to be Bluetooth primarily. I was excited to see that they had an aux cord included, but it just seems like they added it as an afterthought. I haven't gotten the mic to work through the aux cord yet.<br/><br/>*The padding sucks everywhere, the headband that is on the headset only has minimal padding, and as mentioned before the earpads are also not the greatest for larger eared people. So these are borderline not wearable for the larger eared friends out there.<br/><br/>*The app. Sennheiser, what were you thinking? People want customization in their sound and all you can do is change the bass, mids, and treble. I'd love it if there was a bit more customization in the eq. That said, these sound decent enough without an eq, so I'm just nitpicking here, so don't let the app hold you back from getting these.<br/><br/>//Overall 1 Day Review\\<br/>They sound amazing, so get them if they are on sale, I wouldn't buy them if they go back up over $150. They have a lot of things that can be improved and I know they have the updated version (458s). If you're a smaller eared person, and/or are willing to deal with the little irritations here and there, these are an amazing set of headphones.<br/><br/>//Overall one week review\\<br/>After some more research, these headphones do not support using the mic through the 3.5 mm. If you want to use these as conference call headphones, you will need to pair them via Bluetooth to your computer. Another thing I have found out is that the audio quality drops down significantly when using the microphone IF you have sidetone monitoring on.<br/><br/>Another thing is that in my original review, I said the noise canceling wasn't that great, but I didn't really understand what the headphones, and the noise canceling were exactly doing. These headphones are great in the noise canceling department. SPECIFICALLY for listening to music. They won't drown out every single noise, but they get rid of quieter and more constant noises that would distract you from the music.<br/><br/>Battery life on this is amazing. Even with the active noise canceling on, I hardly needed to charge them through the week. And because because they are USBC, they charge extremely quick.<br/><br/>My biggest mark against these in my original review was the comfort. And I'm sad to say these still are not the most comfy headphones. They make my ears feel cramped and I can't spend a huge amount of time with these headphones on. They are bearable, but not the most comfy. Keep this in mind if you have medium to large ears.<br/><br/>//Overall Long-term Review\\<br/>These headphones are great, if you're worried about them being too small, you'll get used to it. Not a great thing to say about a pair of headphones that certainly aren't cheap persay. They're okay on comfort, but you'll find yourself adjusting the earcups regularly to prevent fatigue on your ears. Sometimes I even have to take them off completely for a bit while my ears readjust.<br/><br/>I'm willing to put up with the discomfort because of the sheer quality I get from these headphones. They're amazing for obviously being designed to be linked to mobile devices (phone, tablet, laptop, etc) they sound great over Bluetooth.<br/><br/>So if you find yourself spending money on new $20 headphones every two months, just get these. You'll be blown away by the quality and never want to go back. They're very well built and should never let you down.

Pros:<br/>-The sound quality is really excellent. these are some of the best sounding headphones I've ever had. I've heard the fancy Sony WH-1000XM4's and I like the sound on these much better.<br/>-The noise cancelation is also very good. Maybe not as good as the Sony or Bose but still quite good.<br/>-The build quality is also very good. It's mostly plastic, but it feels pretty solid and I'm not worried it's gonna break. The ear cops also have a nice soft faux leather on them.<br/>-I saw some reviews that said that the layout of the control buttons was confusing, but I did not find that to be the case. Once I acclimated to it, it was totally fine.<br/>-It paired to my phone and laptop very easily.<br/>-The battery also last a long time. I  use these everyday for my commute and I can go over a week between charges.<br/>-They fold up very nicely for storage.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-The ear cups are small and will not fit completely over your ears unless you have the smallest ears in the world. I've tried on other over the ear headphones that had alot more space for your ears. These will sit on your ears and that can be quite uncomfortable.<br/>-The headband has very little padding and it can hurt the top of your head .<br/>-The side tone(which pipes in ambient noise so you can hear your surroundings) is annoying. When you are listening on your phone, you can turn it off though the app. But I have not figured out how to turn it off when I pair with my laptop, so these headphones are super annoying to use for zoom meetings on my laptop for work.<br/>-When you are connected to two devices via Bluetooth and then turn one of them off or go out of range, you get an annoying "disconnected" message that repeats over and over until you turn them off and restart.<br/>-If you want to connect them to a device via a wire you need a specific cord, you can't just use any 3.5mm cord.<br/>-Although you can move the ear cups around a little bit, they cannot fol flat. This means that if you take the headphones off your head and are wearing them around your neck, the ear cups stick up and hit you in the chin, which is annoying.<br/><br/>Overall: These are my first over-ear headphones. I usually prefer on-ears, but it seems that many companies seem to be phasing out the on-ears in favor of over the ears so the on-ears are harder to find. Also the sound quality in over-ears is supposed to be better. But I have to say that after trying these for about 6 months I am giving up on them and am going to go back to on ears. I love the sound, but they are just too uncomfortable for me and hurt my ears and head after about an hour. Also, I wear glasses and the over-ears press against the ear pieces, which is very uncomfortabke. I really wanted to love these because they sound so good, but the discomfort is just not worth it.

The Headset HD 450 BT Holds well to the head without being too tight or loose. This headset has not fallen off of my head by sudden head movements.<br/><br/>I use this for my PC and when I'm gaming the multi directional sound allows for most games to be played comfortably and the sound quality plays well with music having decent base and a wide range of audio. When On PC Best used with a background filter such as Krisp or NVIDIA broadcaster. These headphones can cause you to hear yourself! Just turn input down. Can be used for gaming, calls and music comfortably<br/><br/>The casing  feels solid and is still bendable without straining it<br/><br/>The sound dampening is much better then expected whether from construction (we had some work done in our house) or from software it does a good job at blocking out background sounds.<br/><br/>Battery life is VERY GOOD and I really wish I can put that on bold letters! Holds charge for a long time and when depleted can recharge very quickly for use in just a few minutes.

First and foremost I want to start off by saying that I don't understand why so many people are saying that these headphones don't fit over the ears properly! I have fairly large ears and my ears fit inside the cups. These headphones are very comfortable and they sound fantastic. I have been using Sennheiser products for many many moons now and I was very skeptical about buying these headphones after reading some very odd reviews (none of which are true). Here's the long and skinny of these headphones. The build quility is VERY GOOD, The Sound is VERY GOOD, the Noise Cancellation is okay, but not great. Just to give you a reference to what I am comparing them to. Previously before these, I owned the Sony XB 900s and I absolutely LOVED those headphones. Unfortuanetely the movers who moved me into my new house loved them too and they stole them from me =(. The noise cancellation on the Sony's is definitely more noticable and just better, but I do think that these headphones have a more accurate sound. HENSE the word ACCURATE! The Sony's sounded Awesome, but Sennheiser is known for there awesome accurate sounding headphones and these have that sound.<br/><br/>Are they comfortable? Yes indeed they are. I can were these headphones for hours at a time and not get fatigued at all. I do think the Sony's were a little more comfortable and not as tight, but these aren't tight to the point where you have to take them off 10 minutes after putting them on.<br/><br/>Now for the CONS: When you have the headphones on an you open up a music player or open any app really, you get an annoying speaker pop/click. I don't understand why, I have never had a pair of headphones that popped everytime you opened up an app or turned on or off the headphones. It's not loud and I don't want you to think that you are going to go deaf from this little speaker pop, it's harmless, but nonetheless annoying and a bad defect from an awesome company like Sennheiser. Also when I first put these headphones on for the very first time the sound sounded very narrow, like the sorround sound was turned off. The Sony's definetly had a more spacious sound. The more you listen to the Sennheisers, the better they sound and you will fall in love with the Amazing Sound!<br/><br/>Bottom Line: These headphones are VERY GOOD Sounding headphones. If you just want awesome sound, these will not dissapoint! I have actually heard things in music that I have never heard before, that's how accurate they are. Commfort is like a 4 out of 5, maybe 3 1/2. I have never owned a pair of Bose headphones, so I am guessing that they are about as comfortable is they come. I don't want to mislead on comfortability, because I am sure there are headpones out there that feel like the "My Pillow" on your ears. Again nonetheless, these headphones are comfortable.
----
Great sounding over ear headphones. Light weight. Only thing that I was unable to use it for an extended amount of time was there is a part of the speaker in the headphones that protruded toward the ear that made it too uncomfortable to use for an ecmxtended amount of time.
----
Amazing sound quality, adequate noise cancellation, and you can even download an app to enhance your listening experience. My only issue is they start to slightly hurt your ears after a while, but I experience this with all headphones I've encountered. Overall, very worth the money.
----
Great sound, but you can get better noise cancellation for the price, and controls are not the most intuitive. When you are in calls, the microphone picks up your voice and plays it through the headphones so you can hear yourself talk. There is no option anywhere in hardware or the provided software to turn this off. Good clamping force for a snug fit on your head. Don’t recommend for people with larger ears, they will hurt after a while of wearing these. If you like that however, these may be for you.

I had been stalking a pair of Sony ANC headphones and "settled" on these; I'm glad I did though!<br/><br/>These are comfy, block out noise well passively without making me oblivious to my surroundings, and have really great ANC (I fly a lot). Great for travel or at home.<br/><br/>Sound quality is great! I've got a few pairs of Sennheiser and they never disappoint.<br/><br/>I like the controls on these a lot too; Solid and generously spaced buttons make knowing which does what simple after some quick practice. Volume up and down feels a bit backwards, but that's a minor gripe. The volume button is front to back, and front is vol down with back being vol up.<br/><br/>What I REALLY like about these is how easy it is to pair to different devices. Hold the power button down for an extended period puts them into pairing mode, making it easy to switch from iPhone to iPad to Switch, never having to go to the previous device to UNpair first. This is a little quality of life function that I love.<br/><br/>Bonus is that you can use the provided cable (which in Sennheiser fashion has a proprietary locking mechanism, which is a bit annoying) and use them like a normal wired pair, BUT ANC will not function this way.<br/><br/>Great headphones overall.

I am not an Avantree hype-man, but I will do everyone a favor here: The three 1 Star reviews are basically garbage. Let me scroll through some of the main issues that they bring up and then I will address a few problems. 1. Inferior sound quality and random switching between call quality and playback quality. - I have never had that happen once and the quality switching is most likely due to the sound card in their PC. 2. The latency is between 0.5-2.0 seconds. - I have never experienced this, and, again, this could be due to sub par computer innards. 3. They pale in comparison to the Beats Solo 3 headphones. - Okay, I am a music producer and mix with my headphones as well as monitors, and have had/used high-end headphones, and Beats being superior to the Avantree is true. The Avantree are not up to par with the Beats headphones...but they are also roughly $150-$200 cheaper. You do get what you pay for. I would like to say that they do not "pale in comparison," the merely aren't as good. 4. Claims that the range is minimal. - I haven't had any problems with the range as so long as I am not behind two, lead painted walls...and even then they only cut out a bit. (Yes, I have thick walls with lead paint in my house.) 5. The guy complaining about the lack of Windows 7 compatibility (MANY people have complained about this on a lot of online forums,) as well as other OS's. - Okay. I know computers (you'll have to take my word for it.) First: The headset does not have a firmware problem (someone mentioned cutting out due to the firmware, and not connecting;) second: It is not any one specific OS or a Mac or PC thing, though Win7 is the worst offender being sorely behind the times on some much needed upgrades. Now, let me say that I couldn't even detect them at first with my copy of Windows 7 Ultimate and when they were recognized, I paired them easily, but there was no sound or it kept telling me that there was an install issue with the firmware. Why? My drivers needed to be updated. That's all. You don't need Bluesoleil (a wireless control/bridge center,) or any other fancy crap (unless your computer doesn't have wireless capability, in which case, you need a wireless adapter,) all you have to do is what we all hate doing and update your drivers for whatever your running, and you're fine. It'll work...at least with Win7Ult., which is one of the worst with Bluetooth/firmware. (Side Note: If you do not update your drivers, purchasing Bluesoleil WILL bridge the connection gap in between the headphones and the computer, but why spend an extra $30?)<br/>So, all that being said and done with...There are some complaints that seem valid; a battery that won't keep charge, static, low sound, or syncing issues. All I can say is that these things happen. I have no doubt that these people have legitimately faulty headphones and are not just too stupid to figure out if it is some failing on their end; every brand churns out some duds. Also mentioned was the multi-pairing just grabbing the first Bluetooth signals it encounters with seemingly no proprietary options. This is true. I don't use it for multiple pairings, so it doesn't affect me, but it is a valid complaint and is a feature that should not have been overlooked. The microphone not being useable due to not picking up your voice well enough hasn't been a problem for me, but it was mentioned, so it might fall under the afore mentioned "You got a dud" category. As for the guy with the busted charging port, I would say that that sounds like a user error, but if not, it is another faulty set. (I actually just took my pair off while writing this review right now and tested the solidarity of the charging port and I have no idea how it could become dislodged into the casing like he did, but maybe he got a faulty press.)<br/>So Final Review? - I use these for movies and music, but, as I mentioned, I produce music, and I have a pretty good ear for sound; I have to, and they deliver. The sound quality of the 3.5 audio jack connection and the wireless connection are identical. Some people complain about any audio equipment that they purchase; everyone thinks that he or she is an aficionado, but these are better headphones than the Koss, Sony, and other name brands that I have owned for similar prices. As for comfort, the muffs are built to be firm, but not too firm so they don't become uncomfortable even after hours of use, and the headband sits well. The muffs also cancel out most sound when being worn and people can barely hear what you are listening to even when they are turned up. I have never found a pair of headphones of this quality for a price this low. Are they the last pair of headphones you will ever need to purchase? Nope, but for the price they deliver. Also? One of the 1 Star people gave a shout out to Avantree's Support, and I have to agree. They actually answer their phones and don't act like your an idiot, and the lady whom I emailed got back to me within twenty-four hours and was very helpful. I recommend giving these a try if you are on a budget and can't quite afford the Pioneer Air Studios. Plus, they come with a two-year warranty.<br/>I hope all this helps.

This works really well , good sound , comfortable on my head . My only complaint is that I have to turn my husbands on to turn my set on . If I am using mine and he wants to watch too I have to turn my set off so his will go on then turn my set back on .<br/>However they are worth it . Didn’t realize how much I was missing till I got them .

I am currently on my 3rd pair and absolutely love these headphones. Don't get me wrong, it is not because that these headphones have a small lifespan that I am on my 3rd pair, it's quite the opposite.<br/><br/>Too Long;Didn’t Read: Outstanding Battery Life, Manufactured to last, Great Bluetooth Range, Exceptional Headset, Phenomenal Customer Service, Great Quality for the Price. Only downside was it was hard to adjust the headband initially, but once you adjust them they stay put, which is a plus if you exercise with them.<br/><br/>I bought my first pair February 2016 as I was looking for some Bluetooth headphones to remove the inconvenience of wired earphones/headphones. After doing some research and looking at the reviews, I bought these headphones. The moment I turned them on and connected it to my phone, I fell in love. I wore them daily and listened to music &amp; audio books, with them, any chance I got. After a month, I was on spring break so I went home for a visit. During my visit I lent the headphones to my little sister. She also loved them and wanted them badly, so I gave them to her. She still has her pair and they still work well.<br/><br/>After giving her my headphones, I decided to cheat on Avantree, which I regret, and purchase another highly reviewed pair of bluetooth headphones, the August EP650s. These did not last as long as I thought they would. Comparing the August EP650s to the Avantree headphones, the Avantree headphones outperformed the EP650s in ergonomics, battery life, durability, and bluetooth range. I did like the ability to fold the EP650s though. I did purchase insurance for these headphones and was able to get a full refund when they finally gave out. I, however, did not plan on purchasing another pair of EP650s.<br/><br/>After the EP650s, I decided to go back to my roots and purchase some Symphonized wood wired earphones. Loved these earphones, the sound was rich, I could wear them for hours, and they looked really nice. The only downside was the wires, it felt like they were always in the way when I was on the move. After some good solid months of putting them in my pocket, tugging and bending the wires, the earphones finally gave out.<br/><br/>The Symphonized headphones gave out a few weeks before spring break 2017, so I decided to wait and take my time choosing my next pair of earphones/headphones. However, this year I didn’t make any plans and was dead from my finals so I just wanted to “relax” back home- or so I thought. It was when I was back home that my mom asked me if I could repaint my little brother’s room. I said sure why not, but for those who don’t know me, I need music to get through tedious tasks or else I get bored and stop working. I asked my sister if I could  borrow her, “my”, headphones. Honestly,  if I didn’t have music I probably wouldn’t have been able to finish, but that's not what this review is about. The headphones, my god, I have forgotten how awesome these headphones were. I was working on painting the room at least 8-10 hours a day for 3 days. Now it was just me doing this job. It included removing the furniture, removing posters, laying down the painters tarp, plastering up holes, putting painters tape, painting the room, and then putting everything back. These headphones lasted all 3 days without needing a recharge. I could hear my music clearly, the weight and padding made it comfortable to wear for long hours, and there were no wires to get in the way of work, overall great headphones.<br/><br/>It was May 2017 when I bought my second pair. These lasted me all till the end of January 2018, but in all fairness I was using them everyday for 8-12 hours. I used them while exercising, while walking through campus, while studying, while cleaning, anytime I wasn’t talking to someone I would put them on. The thing that gave out was the battery, the headphones could no longer hold a charge after so many charging cycles. I talked to customer service and received a new pair of headphones for free, as these were still covered by the warranty.<br/><br/>The customer service was in itself phenomenal. I was connected to an actual person within minutes, the problem  was explained and understood quickly, and the matter was taken care of almost instantly. I do not plan on buying other headphones as I think these are the best ones I have come across, especially for the price.

First pair lasted a little over a year and I was able to get a refund under warranty, repurchased and second pair only lasted less than 6 months, as now one side produces only static and the other is poor quality volume. It produces static noise even when not in use, unpaired, and shut down, which is unfortunate because I wanted to use the broken pair to muffle noise a bit.<br/><br/>I bet my first pair would have lasted longer than a year if I did not consistently sleep with them on, so there's that. My second pair I was more careful with.<br/><br/>For the second pair, part of me wonders if the poor lifespan was due to me having to use the cord, as my new phone no longer supported Bluetooth well and went in and out. (This is a common problem with my phone model, apparently, so I don't blame the headphones for the connection there.) I also speculate that not having it charged damaged it, or the fact that the cord had to be rotated in the socket to get both speakers to work on occasion. But I have no clue.<br/><br/>Volume/pause feature is convenient but does not work when connected by cord.<br/><br/>Does not have true "noise cancelling" technology, so if you have a need for good noise cancelling headphones look elsewhere.<br/><br/>Sound quality is amazing and was consistent quality until they died.

First off, I really like these headphones.  I bought them to replace a set of Idea V200 headphones, which were simply too heavy.  (Otherwise, they're pretty nice, and seem very well made.)<br/><br/>What really attracted me to this listing was the generally good reviews, and advertised weight of 180 grams!  I was getting tired of my old wireless headphones pressing on my head, or slipping off / around if I wasn't just sitting still.  These Avantree Audition headphones sound great (I'm far from being an audiophile, but I've had some decent sound systems, and like a pretty wide range of music.)  If anything, these headphones seem much bassier than my previous ones, but I can't really say which one was more accurate.  It isn't distracting, just something to be aware of.<br/><br/>They seem to be well made, and are generally pretty comfortable*.  I love the light weight, and the ear cups are actually big enough to go around my ears.  (My ears aren't huge, but probably on the larger side of "normal").  My one and only gripe so far is the the ear cups simply aren't deep enough to avoid having the tips of my ears press into the foam inner liner.  It isn't any big deal for an hour or so, but as time goes by, it gets more and more annoying, to the point where it's getting to be uncomfortable.  From some of the other reviews, this is a somewhat common problem, and Avantree apparently has deeper ear cups available. (Maybe -- see below).<br/><br/>I say "apparently", because I can't quite get through their email based customer service.  I thought I accurately explained that I wanted to buy a set of "deeper" ear pads, but have been playing email tag over about a week now where they reply with some canned response of how I can return the headphones, or how they're assigning me an RMA number, or are sending me a new set of pads. (Regular, deeper? who knows -- I certainly don't).  All without ever actually admitting whether these deeper pads even exist.  I can't really fault their attempted helpfulness, but it doesn't seem like anyone actually read my email, or my three responses so far.  It seems like rather than "waste" 10 seconds reading my email, they would rather string this out over days and multiple emails.  I don't know if they're just swamped from the holiday rush, or their CS folks aren't native English speakers?  Either way, despite their good attitude and apparent intentions, they aren't actually helping me at this point.  (I remain hopeful, but so far I'd have to give their service 2 stars just based on how much of a run-around this is causing me, and them, when a simple "yes, here is how to order them", or even a "sorry, those are the only size we have" would have avoided all this trouble.)<br/><br/>I the meantime, I just ripped the ~3/16" foam liner out of each ear cup, and put a loop of plastic tubing around the inside of each cup to space the pads out just a bit.  It's not *quite* perfect, but it's very close, and makes them comfortable for the 2-3 hours at a time I wear them.  If I do eventually get deeper pads from Avantree, I will update this review.  For now, these are 5 star headphones for folks with smaller or flatter ears, and maybe 3 stars for us Dumbos.<br/><br/>Update 12/6/2018:  I've received another 3-4 email flurry of copied messages from a back and forth between their customer service, and what I assume is their supplier back in China.  No one actually addressed my questions directly, but it appears they are sending me deeper pads at no charge.  (2-3 week est. delivery.)  I will try to update this once they come in.  Overall,  I'm not quite sure how to rate their customer service.  They have helped me, and at no charge on what is already a pretty low priced item.  On the negative side, it's been a bunch of run-around and until the 7th or 8th email, I never actually got what could be considered an answer to my initial inquiry.

Very comfy and could be alittle louder , but I'm hard of hearing need something for elderly with hearing problems.
----
The sounds quality is great and they're very comfortable.

This is my second pair of these.  My wife liked mine so much, she took them.  I liked them as well, so, I bought another pair.  The sound is fantastic, the bass is extremely good, and they stay charged for a long time.  Recharging is a little longer than I expected, but not enough to cramp my using them.  They are most comfortable and sit well on the head and ear.  Foam around the ear is soft out of the box, and forms a nice seal around the ear, lending to the very good bass rating.  Being that I have bought 2 pair of these, it’s obvious I love them.  The last reason is the cost.  Most times you get what you pay for, but dont let the cost of these sway you in thinking they can’t compete with headphones that cost well over $100.  These rock!  A great purchase, you wont be disappointed.

Great sound , comfortable and easy to connect with my ipad. Bluetooth
----
Used for PC audio while game playing and video.  Have two other headsets by Avantree that I use for watching TV.  Would recommend these to anyone that needs a moderately priced headset.

These headphones fit my child perfectly and are great for school use. Two thumbs up!
----
My 5 year old son got these for his tablet, he likes being able to use his tablet when his twin brothers are sleeping and he’s able to focus on school when they have NTI days as well. No problems with the function. I like that they have the wire.
----
We bought these for our sons (ages 2 &amp; 5) for a long international flight.<br/>I like that they can’t turn the volume up too loud. There’s a control so it is safe for kid’s ears.<br/>They are really good quality for the price you’re paying. They come with a drawstring bag for storage which is nice.<br/>They do not come with an adapter for Apple products, so we purchased one separately and it works great. Just keep that in mind if you’re buying to use with an iPhone or iPad!

Great headphones for kids on the move. We are on our second generation of lilgadgets headphones as our two boys grow (now 7 and 8).  Both have held up to flights, road trips, school and everything in between. For flights, the over the ear design works comfortably for hours, keeps the ambient noise under control and then fold up and tuck away when it is time to transit.<br/><br/>Also great customer service - they helped with a replacement pair even after the warranty had run.  For remote learning, these have been getting hours of use daily, and the quick service was a big help while we are all distanced. Thanks lilgadgets.

These headphones are a great value! We have several pairs of these headphones and one of the toddler sets. We love the way these headphones connect in series so only one headphone port is required but 3 sets can be connected together. The kids can hear their movie or game AND still hear me when I ask them a question. That’s also a good balance for school so we have sets at home and school for each kid! These are pretty durable and the kids are careful but we managed to break a set. I contacted customer service and they were VERY helpful and quickly sent a replacement. Very satisfied repeat customer!
----
I LOVE the look of these headphones and my son loves them - esp the volume control on the cord and the soft earpieces. That said, this is the second pair in a year we've gone through because they've broken. I debated ordering a third pair, but just figure it might be time to buy a different brand.<br/>All of that said, if you order them I'm sure you'll love them while they last!
----
We bought the smaller lil gadget headphone 2 years ago and they were amazing for our little guy. We did not have any issues and if they can get through 2 years with a little boy these are winners! They still work just a little to small for him now and They lasted through kindergarten and 1st grade. So this year since he is bigger we upgraded to this bigger pair and just like the last set these do not disappoint! You will have our business again and again for all the kids!

<span class="cr-original-review-content">El material es de buena calidad en general, el sonido muy controlable y las almohadillas son muy comodas para los niños, aun usando lentes.

First, these headphones are great.  We used the smaller size for Kindergarten and then got this bigger size for first grade and up.  When it "breaks", I've found it's the 3.5mm audio cable with MIC that needs replacing the most.  I've bought this replacement audio cable with MIC and it works great :<br/>Aux Cable, Tsumbay Audio Cable with Microphone and in-line Control, 3.5mm Male to Male Cable Headphone Cable Premium Nylon Auxiliary Cord for Headphones, PS4, Home/Car Stereos (1m)<br/>by ThorFire &amp; More<br/>Learn more: https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B06XXD5SKN/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_1K4GA4J7BA1N22AJV4CQ?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1

Ok so I ordered a total of 6 of these .. and everysingle one of these broke, or bent, or the sound went out. I loved the idea of the headphones how they all could connect to one device  ( we tried it out on a road trip and they worked perfectly). Besides those several days. They were used for distant learning, and they worked for several weeks and then one by one they started breaking, or not working. I thought at first my kids did something- so I replaced them. Got the other set worked just fine for a couple of months then again sounds not working this time - the ear part broke off and was dangling by the wire.  I don’t know- I loved the idea of them I just wish they were durable like they say they are.

I am updating after a couple of years of use as things have changed with firmware updates to warrant adding the last star to make it 5/5, but then having issues with lack of AptX support and limited control over being connected to two devices.  Something up front I think I should say about noise cancelling as there does seem to be a bit of a debate over it, is it does not block out all sounds and it does not muffle sounds equally, but for practical purposes it does do a very good job at noise cancelling striking a good balance of things and being most effective where it is needed the most to make an enjoyable listening experience.  At least this is my experience using this on a daily basis in many different environments.  I have noticed on airplanes I need to fine tune how the headset rests on my head for best results, but once finding the proper adjustment it is almost like I am in an isolation room.  Fantastic.<br/><br/>Overall I am seeing this as well worth the money, a big step up over a much older generation of this product line I had been using, and definitely a huge step up over what came with my phone.  I bought this right after upgrading my phone, so in the past week have found some issues were not the head phone's fault, but instead default sound settings I have since adjusted.  Also been getting more adjusted to the noise cancellation, which is really a great feature of this headset.<br/><br/>For some things I really like about this headset:<br/>1. I have a huge head and this fits nicely on it; even covers my large ears comfortably.  Almost no over the ear headphones do this and I have looked far and wide.  My head is just too big for pretty much all except this particular line of headphones / headsets.  In the ear headsets irritate my ears after a while, causing my ear canals to swell up.  So having something tolerable let alone comfortable to the point that I almost forget they are on is a huge plus.  They also fit on my wife's normal sized head just fine, so it covers a wide range of head sizes pretty well.<br/><br/>2. The sound quality and frequency range is great.  While I would like frequency sliders in their app, the hard coded balance across the range is pretty darn good.  Some reviews say there is a different headset that sounds better, but especially after this latest update, I am having trouble finding room for improvement; it sounds excellent across the range, even deep bass.  The main limit I hit is a streaming service I use defaulted back to low quality when I upgraded my phone, so deep bass was crushed a bit and overall was not sounding as good as my home computer which has been the same machine for a while now (where I got the quality options set right a while back), but resetting the values and clearing the cache has fixed this issue.  Really with noise cancelling mixed in I am hearing a lot more detail that would normally get washed out from background noise and my desire to keep volume levels down in order to preserve my hearing.  Have the best of both worlds now.<br/><br/>3. In call sound quality is reported to be good across a number of calls now, even from the datacenter floor.  Especially considering this does not have a boom mic, that is pretty good.  I remember in the past getting a call on the datacenter floor with a lesser headset and nobody could hear anybody.  Then again they have been moving servers to the cloud and the remaining servers are running cooler with the reduced heat load on the CRACs and thus their fans have slowed a bit, bit it is still really loud in there, so both parties hearing loud and clear is pretty amazing.<br/><br/>4. The battery really does go the distance and I would venture to say the 20 hour rating would be for harsh use cases where my main use case is mellow office building use.  I am thinking more like 25 hours in an office.  I just love how my newer devices can just go and go on batteries, at least initially where in the past battery life started off too short an then quickly became frustratingly way too short.  Starting off with plenty of time I have some room to do some battery life extension tricks like limiting the charge window manually.  Now if this was something built into the product like what you can do with a Tesla car, that would be really nice as changing out batteries every two years or so, especially with how devices are built these days is a bit of a PITA and too often goes badly.<br/><br/>5.  For sound cancellation, I have to say there is something to be said for pretty much all of the ambient noise just going away and it just being dead silent.  Seems to weird some people out, but I think it is great.  Can still hear people talk and other loud sounds, but I seems to be rather muffled.  Also it seems to be good at figuring out what is white noise and clearing that out completely where some other frequencies that are more useful get through better.  Also love being able to walk down a busy street and hear my music, especially without having to sacrifice my eardrums in the process, especially as a lot of really loud noise around freeways and such are really muffled down.  Found in a noisy data center that if I were to go to the barber, they would work better, but still work quite well with the hair I have, just little bit of bleed through sound from the excess hair around my ears.  Pressing the headphones down causes things to get a lot quieter.  Plenty good for easy on the ear drum music listening while in the data center.  Have used for other things like muffling noisy power tools and having my wife watch her TV next to me and not be distracted by anything at all.  Beginning to think this could be the beginnings of a great relationship... Oh wait a sec.<br/><br/>My complaints so far are:<br/>1. My #1 complaint is removed as it seems to have been fixed with the latest firmware update as I thought would be possible.  Star added back.  Thanks Bose!<br/><br/>2. I have noticed doors around the office that automatically slam shut while this headset muffles the higher frequencies, the lowest frequencies seem amplified and so it is like my head is getting hit with a sound pressure wave.  Been thinking about this more and I have been moving in the direction of what this does muffle, it does so well that what it does not effectively muffle seems quite loud as the ears adjust to the greatly reduced sound levels hitting them overall.<br/><br/>3. The radio antenna seems to be on the right side only.  Being a lefty I like putting my phone on the left side, but that just does not go well.  Have to use the right side when going for a walk.  People call me a 'giant', so there is a lot of body for the signal to go through, so most people will probably never notice this issue.<br/><br/>4. No AptX support.  When connected to TV bluetooth, lips are out of sync.  The delay is maybe 170ms, so the delay is in the realm of something I can accept.  For those who can't stand this kind of issue, then the Sony option is for you.<br/><br/>5. Not much control over which source plays when connected to two devices at the same time.  If two devices are playing at the same time it will just pick one it seems.  Doing things like connected to phone and TV at the same time, well TV will just cut out with the slightest sound from the phone.  Would be nice if the headset would mix the two sources or if I could set it to say prefer the TV and only switch to the phone when the TV stops.  Also use this with my laptop and see the same deal.  It is nice at least I have have a few different devices to connect to.  It is just if I really want to get serious with my laptop or desktop computer, I have to use the audio cable for the previous version of this headset for a combination of dedicated sound, low latency sound, and mic support, especially in COVID-19 days where I am on video conferences all the time and the webcam mic is not nearly as good as the mic on this headset at least in terms of eliminating various room scale artifacts that annoy the hell out of people in video conferences.  Would be nice if I could do this all from bluetooth, but sadly bluetooth is mainly for system sounds and music, which is still really handy when I am not on a conference call.

I left a lengthy review comparing the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. This is a shorter version of that review, mostly focusing on QC35II and E285. This was almost entirely written up during the week I had all four headsets for direct comparisons.<br/><br/>Microphone and Playback<br/>QC35II recordings were consistently louder than the E285. But the E285 did a far better job of removing background noise, as evidenced by my recordings while drumming. Muting can be done with the QC35II but it was much more difficult than just raising/lowering the boom arm of the E285.<br/><br/>Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophile<br/>E285 and SX4 audio sound better than the QC35II but primarily because I can use an equalizer and increase bass (obviously this is the most important factor). Even if the QC35II had better hardware, it’s not as accessible and therefore is a moot point. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Brand<br/>Bose: wanted my location and would ask for it every time I open the app (and wouldn’t allow usage without accepting beyond the standard Bluetooth connection process). These are headphones. You don’t need my location.<br/><br/>Jabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice! Win for Jabra. Runner up is Sony.<br/><br/>ANC<br/>When standing in front of running water, QC35II had slightly better cancellation, but not a noticeable difference without actively concentrating. When playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. During testing of the QC35II, whether ANC was on/off, there was a ceaseless light static (with no audio playing). I thought it quite odd and luckily, it didn’t happen again, but I suppose it could. With the QC35II, when the drum pad was hit, there was a tang sound, like the residual sound from tapping on a pan, as opposed to the muffled thumping the E285 gives. Perhaps with a constant noise the QC35II does a slightly better job filtering, but the E285 does a better job with impact noises (or maybe it’s just higher frequencies).<br/><br/>In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. With the QC35II ANC off, it sounds like the microphone is picking up sound and then replaying it in the speakers. In contrast, the E285 hear-through, which has adjustable levels, almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Connectivity<br/>The E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. QC35II, SX4, and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.<br/><br/>Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. The QC35II and SX4 are only Bluetooth, so you have to do the standard “add device”, etc. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.<br/><br/>Response time: the QC35II and B700 have a slightly faster response time when pausing media than the E285. The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 also have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Again, the E285 feel lack-luster in comparison because they take approximately 4 M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-I seconds to pause, whereas the SX4 is half that time. For the E285, I’ve noticed the ear detection only works properly when playing music from your phone and not the PC. When using it with the PC, if I remove the headphones, the music will pause as it should. But it doesn’t resume when I put them back on. If I pause the music with the button, then remove the headset, it resumes. Again, cool feature, but needs work, especially when using it with the PC.<br/><br/>App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. Some issues with QC35II (Bose Connect). LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Win for SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Voice Assistant<br/>Couldn’t even get B700 to work. First off, I have to change the “action” button from ANC control to activate voice assistant (so you can’t have both functionalities at the same time). However, once button mapping was adjusted accordingly, I click the button and it says “open your Google Assistant settings”, with no further instructions. I open the Home app, and once again, no further instructions, so I didn’t get it working. I didn’t spend anymore time on it because in contrast, the E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature (you can still press the action button with the boom arm up and have the assistant prompt, but because the arm is up, the microphone is off so it’s pointless). Perhaps Bose has better functionality when used with Alexa, but I use Google so I’m not bothering with testing that. Tie between E285 and SX4.<br/><br/>I know this is extremely nit-picky, but the Bose assistant’s voice is far more annoying than Jabra or Sony. She sounds like an actual robot as opposed to someone I wouldn't mind meeting.<br/><br/>Controls<br/>The QC35II and E285 have essentially the exact same button layout and functionality. The key difference is the action button on QC35II. It can be EITHER for voice assistant or cycling through ANC. On the other hand, you can access both functionalities on the E285, with the caveat of lowering the boom arm first for the voice assistant. The other difference is placement of the power button. On the QC35II, it’s a lateral switch on the side of the right ear cuff. On the E285, it’s a vertical switch on the bottom of the left ear. I literally don’t have a preference between the two. However, I do have a preference for the other buttons. While in the same place (the action button on the QC35II is in the same place as the ANC cycling button on the E285), the QC35II has a much more noticeable difference between the volume buttons and the play/pause, which I like better. All the buttons are bigger and more defined, plus the volume buttons are slightly raised, making it even easier to know what you’re pressing. On the E285, the buttons take up less surface area and are rather flat.<br/><br/>Muting is definitely easier with the E285 because you simply raise or lower the boom mic. Though it also  takes a little longer. The QC35II is more annoying because you have to press two buttons at the same time (the volume buttons). Win for SX4 (touchless controls are better). Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Comfort and Style<br/>I prefer the QC35II. Though I’ve been wearing the E285 for a little over an hour and was so comfortable, I had to look to my left to see which headset I wasn’t wearing. So both are very comfortable, but for comparison’s sake, it’s a win for QC35II. Runner up is E285/SX4 (just as comfortable).<br/><br/>Extra<br/>The E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.<br/><br/>Issues<br/>My biggest issue was trying to connect QC35II with my Google Assistant. Besides that, functionality of the QC35II was pretty much flawless. Speaking of Google Assistant, there’s some variability with functionality with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.<br/><br/>Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars while the QC35II I gave two. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. Even so, the E285 is better in just about every way. Stronger connection, more functionality, better app, better audio, better background noise removal (though the QC35II you could maybe argue is better at ANC, but not during a call). As far as functionally using the QC35II, I would give it three stars. But I give it two because the Bose app REQUIRES your location and that is absolutely ludicrous. It's a pair of headphones. You don't need my location. Note - if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.

I give it five stars. My wife hates them she would give it 1. I put them on and that’s it. I can’t hear her any more.

Around the holidays, I decided to treat myself to a pair of high quality headphones. I live in the central area of a major US city, and to be frank the noise pollution was driving me a little crazy. I was interested in a pair of headphones that would give me some peace and quiet, so I spent a lot of time looking at ANC (active noise-Cancelling) options and the Sony WH1000MX3 and Bose QuietComfort 35 II were easily the top picks among reviews.<br/><br/>However, there were a lot of different opinions about which was better. The split was about 50/50 between the Sony and Bose, so I was pretty torn. Even though they were heavily discounted for the holidays ($280 each), that's a lot of money considering I generally never spend more than $50 for headphones. So I bought them both as an experiment, with the plan to return one after I made a decision.<br/><br/>Let me get this out of the way now, because I'm going to get pretty detailed below. Ultimately, I understand why there's such a debate about whether the Sony or Bose is better. They are both fantastic headphones. I loved them so much that I made the probably financially irresponsible decision to keep them both! They were both so good, but better than the other in completely unique ways. For that reason, there was no dealbreaker for me that makes one superior than the other -- It really comes down completely to personal preference and that's why there is so much debate.<br/><br/>The TL;DR of this review is that you should buy the Sony if you value sound quality most, and don't plan to wear them for long periods of time (i.e. over 5-6 hours per session). You should buy the Bose if you value comfort the most, and if you're planning to use them for phone calls.<br/><br/>If you're interested in a bit more detail, I'll give my opinions on these aspects: ANC, Sound, Comfort, Versatility<br/><br/>ANC<br/><br/>The noise-cancelling on both of these is phenomenal. I had assumed Bose would do better at this since it's what they're known for, but I'm surprised to say the Sony's ANC is slightly better. It does a bit better blocking out non-drone sounds (i.e. people talking, sharp noises, etc) compared to the Bose. With that said, they both are practically equal and I don't think the Sony ANC is so much better than the Bose that it would justify buying them on that factor alone. When wearing either pair, I sometimes feel like a spaceman walking around my apartment because everything is so quiet.<br/><br/>SOUND<br/><br/>This is a clear winner for Sony. No questions asked, the sound is clearer, crisper, and deeper. This is especially noticeable when watching movies/TV shows or playing video games. With the Sony, I feel like I can hear each individual sound clearly, whereas with the Bose everything is a little more muddled together. With that being said, the Bose sound is perfectly acceptable and even 'good'. It's just that for a $300 pair of headphones I'd expect a more premium quality where I am amazed at how clear the sound is. The Sony does that; the Bose are a tier below.<br/><br/>COMFORT<br/><br/>Hands down, the Bose are better. I can literally wear them for 14 hours and they don't bother me except for needing to give my ears a little air every once in a while. I have never, ever worn a pair of headphones this comfortable before. I'm especially grateful for this comfort now that I'm working from home all day because of COVID-19. The Sony headphones are a bit heavier and clamp on your head a little bit more tightly. They also press down on your ears, whereas the Bose are deep enough that my ears don't even touch the inside of the cans. The Sony are still definitely comfortable, but a tier below the Bose. I can still wear them for about 6 hours before they bother me, so if you don't wear headphones that long it might not be a problem for you.<br/><br/>VERSATILITY<br/><br/>This is just a catch-all for all the other aspects of the headphones. Nothing here I would consider a selling point strong enough for most people to make a final decision, but if you have specific needs then this might be helpful.<br/>1. I like the physical buttons on the Bose more than the touch buttons on the Sony. They just work better, and I make mistakes with them less often.<br/>2. Sony has better technology. They use USB-C so the headphones charge faster than the Bose mini-hdmi. They also have better bluetooth connection technology, which lets a higher bitrate of audio transfer wirelessly. Without getting too technical, I think this is a major reason why the sound quality on the Sony is better.<br/>3.  Bose is better if you want to connect to multiple devices. Bose can connect to two devices simultaneously, but Sony can connect to only 1 device at a time. For example, if I am listening to music on my computer and I get a phone call, if I'm wearing the Bose, I can answer and talk on the call through my headset, and when I hang up music will resume. With the Sony, I'd either have to disconnect from my computer, then reconnect to my phone  before the call ended, or take off the headphones completely and answer the phone separately.<br/>4. Sony looks a little more stylish and futuristic. The Bose look like an ordinary pair of headphones. Build quality is identical though<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/><br/>5 months after buying these, do I regret keeping them both? NO! They are absolutely worth the money if you have it. Generally, I find that I wear the Bose throughout the day as I'm working from home. They're really comfortable to wear all day long, if I get a call from a co-worker I don't need to take them off, and I'm just listening to music as background noise while I work so sound quality isn't important. After dinner, it's always the Sony. When I'm focusing on a new album, watching a movie, or playing a video game, I really value how good the sound is. And generally I only wear them for 3-4 hours at this point so discomfort is never an issue.<br/><br/>If you twist my arm about it and made me pick only one pair to own the rest of my life? I'd probably take the Bose just because I wear them so much while working from home. But that's not a fair metric, and each individual will have a different primary purpose for these and that should be your guiding principal when making the choice.<br/><br/>Good luck!

I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:<br/><br/>i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very "clean" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as "calming". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.<br/><br/>ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don't expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.<br/><br/>iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.<br/><br/>iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.<br/><br/>v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn't play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows &amp; Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can't connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.<br/><br/>Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.<br/><br/>vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.<br/><br/>I hope this helps...

The Bose QC35 II is by far the best pair of headphones I’ve owned...and I have used quite a few...<br/><br/>I haven’t owned this long enough to give feedback on battery and interaction w/my Echo Show (Alexa) but I’m hoping those will be good experience.<br/><br/>I’m here mostly for those who are considering investing in these great headphones for the purpose of singing in Smule (the Sing app).<br/><br/>First of all, I think it’s pretty ridiculous that Bose would include an audio cable/wire without including a MIC audio wire!  But since it’s not a big deal and no big investment, this is resolved by purchasing a 3.5mm wire w/mic, right? WRONG!<br/>To make matters a bit more frustrating for consumers such as myself, not only Bose made the female input jack in these headphones smaller than 3.5mm but they also make no mention of it in the owner’s manual.  To say such thing is super lame on Bose’s part is gross understatement!<br/><br/>So...if you are indeed thinking of buying these to use with Smule app, you’ll need to invest in good audio wire with microphone (I invested in Beats mic wire...can be found at Walmart for $20) and had to purchase a 3.5mm female converter with a 2.5mm male plug in order to connect the Beats mic wire to my new QC35 II.  Now, what was BOSE thinking?  After all, they know about Smule and how the worldwide popular singing app has and is creating plenty market for the audio equipment industry...and Bose didn’t impress me when it comes to making it rather inconvenient to use these Bluetooth headphones work w/wired mics.<br/><br/>And no, I haven’t found any headphones with wired mics that supersede the sound quality that my Bose QC35 II headphones render.  So it’s something for Bose to improve...and their marketing folks ought to know better than omit important info from consumers.  While Bluetooth option is an awesome thing, there remains certain online activities that require wired mics...Smule being one...and trust me, I’ve tried using “state of the art” expensive audio equipment to sing in Smule and even the most advanced of audio equipments (such hand held microphones; stand mics (Yeti), mic filters, digital headphones, etc, etc) render poor audio result compared to using wired mics with a good set of headphones.  As far as Smule sing app goes, even cheap earbuds do far better (because it has wired mics!) than expensive audio equipment without wired mic!<br/><br/>So either Bose “forgot” that some of us need wired mics w/a 3.5mm male plug, and by the way, that’s SUPER USEFUL for when battery time is shorter than the consumer intends to use these headphones for, or Bose purposely made these nice headphones w/a 2.5mm female input to make us go out and spend more money just to plug into their nice Bluetooth headphones??<br/><br/>Whatever the reason, I expected a LOT BETTER from BOSE, especially while paying almost $400 (that price includes extra service protection warranty) for A PAIR OF HEADPHONES that don’t even come with a wired mic and HAVE NO input to connect a 3.5mm audio cable to the headphones! I feel that there’s always some type of sound quality loss when we have to use adaptor connectors so I truly don’t understand why Bose chose to make the QC35 II with a 2.5mm female input in the headset while providing a cable that has no mic in it!  Yes, some use these just to listen to music, videos, news, etc.  But what if I’m listening to something in my device while wearing these and using the audio wire and my mother or a friend calls me via FaceTime or Facebook messenger or whatever else?  I can easily accept the video call but must unplug the headphones, which usually causes an audio problem in the video conference app, because it doesn’t transfer audio, once the audio device first used is disconnected. Something Bose seems to have completely disregarded.  Obviously, the focus in these is the Bluetooth capabilities.  But I ask Bose this question: why would I buy a wired pair of Bose headphones that cost not a lot less than these while getting less quality sound?  So if these work with audio cable, which it does, why not include an audio cable with a mic???  Charge the extra $20 or so dollars for goodness sake but it’s pretty sad to make such great quality headphones without sending it with a wired mic while knowing that the microphones in our devices don’t handle all recordings and are not designed to work well with singing apps!  Headphones aren’t just for listening!  What do professional singers wear when recording their songs inside a studio?? HEADPHONES!  Is it important for them to hear their own voices through the headphones they wear? You bet!  This is why those headphones are well connected with whatever microphones professional singers and studios use.  The same is true for ordinary, amateur singers such as myself.  But unlike pro singers, all we ordinary singers need is a wired mic that connects directly to the fancy expensive Bose headphones we invest on!<br/><br/>It’s a BOSE so yes, they are awesome headphones.  But needless to say I’m rather disappointed.  I can’t use these until the extra pieces arrive and worse than that, I had to find out the hard way!  Nothing in the specs here or even in the Bose website or in the owner’s manual shows that these headphones have a 2.5mm female input to the audio cable.  I feel a wired mic w/the appropriate size plug should be something to expect in a pair of headphones that cost $350!!!! Most of all, I feel that any type of electronic should come with pictures of it indicating the physical parts inside and outside of it.<br/><br/>Bose mentions that they include the 3.5mm audio cable.  Unfortunately, they make NO mention that the end of the audio cable which plugs into the headphones is actually size 2.5mm!<br/><br/>REALLY, BOSE??  A $20 mic wire with the correct size male plug to fit into the headset unconventional female input size would’ve saved a lot of frustration here...not to count given you a perfect “5 stars” score...

I wanted a new headset for everyday activities. I work on the computer quite often editing videos so I needed something comfortable and cozy. I was initially very hesitant because the price tag was a bit hard to justify on a headset. Saw that the price was slashed during the holiday season and quickly pulled the trigger!<br/><br/>The build quality is very nice and strong. I am definitely a huge fan of how the headset is able to fold so that it makes carrying it very easy and portable. Also, it comes with a nice case to hold the headset as well!<br/><br/>After trying it on, my mind was blown! This is totally worth the money, just everything about it was pretty nice! The fit, sound, and build, I liked everything about it! I liked this headset so much that I bought additional wires to use them for gaming as well!

After doing a lot of research, it ultimately came down to the Bose QC 35 and Sony 1000XM2.  I tried them both for several days but in the end, the Bose QC 35 was my choice, which wasn't an easy one to make.  You can't go wrong with either pair as they are both very nice headphones.  The final decision for me was whether I wanted a little better quality (Sony) or better fit/comfort (Bose).  I chose comfort and the Bose 1000XM2.  Here are some other things I noticed...<br/><br/>SOUND QUALITY:<br/>No question at all, the Sony 1000Xm2 are better sounding headphones.  Don't get me wrong, the Bose are still very good.  However, I really liked and preferred the bass response of the Sony over the Bose.  Bose are the brighter sounding headphones but the biggest difference was how they sound with bass, which Sony does better.<br/><br/>FIT / COMFORT:<br/>The Bose gets the edge on fit/comfort.  They are VERY comfortable and light!  The Sony 1000xm2 are fine but they fit a bit more snug than Bose.  At first, I actually preferred the Sony fit.  However, after having them on for an hour or longer, that's where I noticed the biggest difference... ear fatigue.  Much less ear fatigue with the Bose.  That all being said, what is more comfortable to me might be less comfortable to you.  You just have to try them on, ideally for extended periods of time.  I bought these particularly when I fly where I plan to wear them for hours at a time.  Even though I prefer the sound quality of the Sony, I just couldn't get over the incredibly comfortable fit of the Bose.<br/><br/>BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY:<br/>Both do a fine job here but the Bose were the more reliable in establishing a connection without having to fiddle around with settings.  When comparing the Sony and the Bose, I often went back and forth trying when trying out the headphones.  Every time that I went back to the Bose, it was fast and easy.  With the Sony pair, I had to go into my Bluetooth settings a few times in order to get a connection.  It really wasn't a big deal but the Bose gets the edge here because it is painless and works more reliably.<br/><br/>DURABILITY:<br/>I won't give either pair the edge here because I only had them for a week BUT do keep in mind that the Sony 1000xm1 had issues with the headband cracking.  Because Sony hasn't clearly stated whether they resolved the issue with the xm2's, it's anyone's guess.  This alone probably wouldn't keep me from going with the XM2's but it is something to consider.<br/><br/>CONTROLS:<br/>I like them both and consider this a toss up.  With the Sony pair, you just swipe the headphones to control the music and volume while the Bose has hard buttons.  At first, I definitely preferred the hard buttons that are on the Bose.  However, after getting used to swiping on the Sony's, I found it easy enough to do.  Which do I prefer?  Probably the hard buttons because they are a bit more reliable than the swiping.  This is very subjective though and I could see some preferring the swiping while others preferring the hard buttons.  It just depends on what you like.  For me, I found both to work fine.  The Sony does have a feature where you can put you hand over the right headphone and it will allow you to hear outside noise without having to take them off.  Cool feature?  Maybe for some but for me, I didn't see any use for it.  If someone approaches me while wearing big headphones like these, I'm going to take them off my head rather than keeping them on with my hand cupping the right headphone.  It just seems a bit rude not to do so.<br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/>They both have their pluses and minuses here.  It really depends on what is most important to you.  I really like how the Sony 1000XM2 allows you to customize the sound (including equalizer).  It also has the ability to modify you settings depending on where you are listening to them by simply pressing a button.  I don't really no what impact that has though because I only tried this a couple of times.  The fact of the matter is that Sony provides a bit more customization which I like!  The Bose has google assistant which I found to be a cool feature.  I could live without this but it is a nice feature.  The feature that I found VERY useful on the Bose is the ability to play text messages through the headphones.  I was on a flight recently where we were waiting for our turn to take off.  While listening to my music, I was notified that I had a text message.  Instead of having to reach for my phone (Sony) the Bose pair allowed me to just push the action button to hear the text.  I found this awesome.  Sony does not have this feature.  What headphones gets the edge?  For me, it's another toss up.  I really like the customization of the Sony but the Bose are very cool with being able to read my text messages (and google assistant).<br/><br/>LOOKS:<br/>They both look great!  I had the gold/beige Sony's and the silver Bose.  I might give a slight edge to Bose as I like the silver look and the Bose logo on each headphone.  However, this is very subjective.<br/><br/>SUMMARY:<br/>This is one of those times where you just can't go wrong with either pair.  They both have their pros and cons but in the end, for me, I prefer the Bose QC 35 by a very small margin.

Really love these headphones. I am just a casual music listener, so I just wanted comfortable headphones with decent sound quality, and these are that! I didn't really care about noise cancellation but these are insanely noise cancelling. You can download the app and choose different levels of noise cancellation (high, low and off), I often opt for the low level. It blocks out quite a bit of noise around me while having these on even with the low level of noise cancellation. As for sound quality/volume, I think both are decent but the volume sometimes feels a bit low so i have to turn the volume up a bit to hear music. There is apparently a microphone and calling option but i never use that. I opted for the gray color as I saw a ton of reviews with the black ones coming damaged and I adore them! It comes in a case with a charging cord and a cord to make these into wired headphones. Also super comfortable, I often have issues with other headphones hurting my ears after a few hours but these don't hurt at all! Battery life is great, lasts for a good while without needing a charge. They feel hefty and good quality in your hands. Would def recommend! It seems like this listing and price is constantly changing but I got these new and for $289 (not including tax and such)

I bought these back in Nov 2020 and have been wearing them to bed almost every night drifting off to sleep watching/listening to youtube on a mounted tablet. I honestly have little or nothing negative to say about them.<br/><br/>10/10 Durability-<br/>I'm generally pretty careful with my stuff, but I roll around in bed a lot and can't count how many times I've woken up with these things wrapped around my neck in all sorts of orientations. I've woken up sleeping on top of them. Not any sign whatsoever of them breaking down or the material wearing out.<br/><br/>9/10 Comfort-<br/>It's the namesake of the product and it's no lie if you know how to use 'em. These are the most comfortable pair of headphones I have owned. At first it was painful because the cans, while comfortable, are rather large and press into your head when you're sleeping on your side. The trick is to tighten the headband all the way and turn them upside down so the headband is resting on your chin. This stops them from pressing into your skull when you're sleeping on your side. If I have one nitpick, it's that it SHOULD be possible to shape the cans so that that's not necessary. Very small gripe, though.<br/><br/>10/10 Quality of life-<br/>Until I put these on, I didn't realize how much ambient noise was in my apartment just from my AC/Heater/appliances etc. I also didn't realize how sensitive to noise I was and how much of a game-changer good noise cancelling is. They charge pretty quickly (as most headsets/headphones do) and the battery life is acceptable. They do charge via Micro USB which makes them feel kind of old because nearly everything I have charges via USB Type C. As a result, you have plug them in just right and that can be somewhat difficult to do in the dark. If I could change anything about these headphones it would probably be that.<br/><br/>9/10 Bluetooth Quality- I don't venture far from my connected devices so range hasn't been a problem. These don't get any interference from any other bluetooth devices and I don't think they have ever randomly disconnected or 'skipped' during playback. Any complaint I have would be about the format and not the product itself.<br/><br/>Affordability 7/10- These are expensive, but in my experience you get what you pay for. I live alone so I can happily wear these all day and they were worth every penny if just for the noise cancelling. I would absolutely buy a second set and rotate them out when charging, but the price is a little steep for that.<br/><br/>?/10 sound quality- I'm not an audiophile so I'm underqualified to go into depth about this. Sound quality is sufficient. I don't currently own any headphones that I would say are better on this front. No complaints here.<br/><br/>Overall it's a great product that I would absolutely recommend for daily and nighttime use. I'm surprised they've held up this long with me sleeping/rolling all over them and I would purchase another set in a heartbeat if they did break. I would recommend them for anyone who lives alone. I wish I could wear them all day just for the noise cancelling. It's so much more peaceful!

Solid construction and very comfortable (would add more stars for comfort if could).  I was pleased to hear how much more range of sound with a "fuller" sound I could hear over my "vintage" earlier headphones (not an audiophile and do not know the technical term for the fullness along the range).  You can remove the headphones safely by the metal clasps that connect to the cups, feels solid.<br/>I am using these with a Fiio K5 Pro ess and they easily handle sound at the mid setting with these 250 ohm headphones.  If there was any downside, there is a wire that connects to the headphones that may catch on something if you were careless and throwing them around, but the solid construction and metal clasp more than make up for that design (they will not break at any hinge).<br/>The hard shell case it came with is solid with velvet interior that fits like a glove with a large zipper.<br/>They fit solidly around the ear, but if someone has the TV on in same room, you will hear it when headphone sound goes down in volume.
----
Coming from a pair of Sony WH-1000XM3's, these sound amazing. I'm not an audiophile but I can tell that these have a much wider sound stage. I could hear much more than I ever could before. They sound great, look great, and are very comfortable.<br/><br/>Where these completely fall apart for me is the cable design. Right out of the box the cable immediately bunches up into a mess of spaghetti. For a while I just tolerated it, but then one day I decided to put it into a cable sleeve. That helped, but it would still curl around itself. So I went to the extreme and fed some shish kabob sticks into the sleeve in order to force it to stay straight. I should have done that in the first place because it worked great. Then one day one ear decided to stop working unless I contorted the cable in a random way. Being annoyed with this I took the cable sleeve off to see if there was any sort of damage I may have inadvertently caused. There was no damage, but now they didn't work at all. Even with contorting the cable, I was extremely lucky to get them to work in one ear. Needless to say I am done with these headphones. Only having them for around 5 months, I never dropped them, sat on them, traveled with them, spilled water on them, nothing. But due to the cable constantly being bunched up I came to the conclusion that the wires inside the cable itself must have have separated or become frayed. Just ordered a pair of Sennheiser HD 599 that come with a DETACHABLE cable. Hopefully these will last longer than the Beyers.<br/><br/>FYI these work great with this amp --&gt; https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VDQQY95/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>TLDR: Great sounding headphones as well as comfort and looks. F grade cable design took them out of service after 5 months of normal use.

I bought these to pair with an Antlion ModMic as my other headset had died. I knew I needed closed back since I share a space. Anyway, they are a tad treble heavy, especially in between the 9-10k range, so I dial that down a bit with Equalizer APO. Aside from that, they have an exciting bass response that is excellent for games.<br/>The headphones themselves are very well built and they rest very comfortably on my head, even after several hours of use. The soundstage of these headphones is surprisingly good for them being closed back.<br/>All-in-all, I don’t regret my purchase one bit. Just be sure that you do your research and know what it is you are looking for in whatever headphone that you are buying.

Best I have ever owned
----
I use these for studio monitoring of voice recordings for narration / voice over. They’re flat response is outstanding. It makes editing SO much easier. EXTREMELY comfortable with LARGE cups, and ‘felt/velvet’ covered ear up pads. I can wear these for 6-8 hours with no discomfort. Should’ve bought these years ago. Cord is long and allows plenty of room to move in the booth, and at my desk while editing. Best money I’ve spent in quite so e time. Made in GERMANY. GREAT QUALITY!! Can’t recommend these enough for voice editing. I haven’t pushed music through these and will not comment on that aspect. These are passive noise cancellation through ear cup padding and closed back design. Very good in that respect. I have larger ears and these fit me better than any closed headphones I’ve ever used.
----
These produce very clear and detailed frequency response for studio work.  The earpads could be a little comfier, but they do a decent job of outside noise isolation.
----
Super comfortable. Can’t say it enough. No ear fatigue with these.
----
After LONG in-depth research these are the headphones I chose. I'm OCD about researching anything electronic that costs over a few hundred dollars. I try and find the best performance/price ratio while not sacrificing quality. These headphones sound amazing and are heads and tails above any headphones I've owned before. I'm really glad I chose the 80 Ohm model as they still work really well with my phone and give more than enough volume. The build quality is great and they are very comfortable wearing for long periods of time even though they are over the ear and closed back. Very happy with this purchase.
----
Amazing build quality and very comfortable. I can wear it for hours before it starts to get a bit uncomfortable but they fit perfectly, can be adjusted, and sound great. Everything that the reviews from professional sound engineers and producers say.
----
I first tested them with my iPhone, listening to music. The volume had to be raised higher than I wanted but they sounded pretty solid. The Mids were solid, highs were solid, bass was decent. My second test was in live performance. I used them with my aviom and the kick drum was peaking at mid volume! Tones were low as well. I tried a direct plug, no adapter, same thing. I raised the volume, it was worse. Personal use, studio use, they probably work great. For drummers and live performance, you will need something better.

I've owned these about nine months now.  I'm a huge audio nerd, and I love these headphones!<br/>Quick points:<br/>-  frequency response is incredible.<br/>-  you won't need a DAC -- they're very sensitive (efficient).<br/>-  sub-bass is present, if a little quiet, but<br/>-  they can take MASSIVE amounts of sub-bass if EQ'd<br/>-  great for people who are sensitive to treble<br/>-  they're really comfortable -- I can wear them for hours, with glasses<br/>-  their floppiness takes some getting used to<br/>-  they isolate sound pretty well<br/>-  you'll want to buy a different cable (there's an awesome 1.2m braided one on Amazon for $12)<br/><br/>They sound /so/ flat.  ("flat" here refers to a graph of their frequency response, where a "flatter" graph gives a sound that's de-emphasized across the frequency spectrum -- it doesn't make some notes too loud and others too soft, just reproduces them exactly as they were recorded.)  They respond to EQ really well, but I don't feel the need to use EQ on any part of the range besides sub-bass (and only for trap, future bass, etc.).  Of course, their response isn't the most even and flat (according to professional measurements I've found), but it's really, really great.  What is emphasized makes detail (2kHz to 6kHz) just a little more present, without being harsh.  To my ears, a lot of headphones in this price range and higher sound too harsh because they emphasize treble too much.  I had that concern with these at first, but for my ears, they're right on the edge without going overboard -- just about perfect.<br/>You can practically use them as speakers with a mobile device -- they're that sensitive.  You definitely don't /need/ to use a DAC with these.<br/>I love sub-bass.  I listen to a lot of trap, future bass, and misc. edm where the subbass really needs to speak.  These headphones start to roll off around 70Hz, but not so drastically to where these styles aren't enjoyable without an EQ.  I could go without EQ on these headphones, but I don't.  What's great about these is that you can throw all the sub-bass boost you want at them and they still perform superbly.  I use as much as +25dB at 31Hz (on a 29-band EQ) and they handle it excellently.  In that regard, I give in before they do.  I recommend AIMP if you're on Android so you can dial in the bass just how you want it, if you're into that sort of thing.<br/>With other types of music and with podcasts, audiobooks, etc, I don't even think to use EQ with these headphones.  Acoustic instruments never sounded so good before, or so true-to-life.  And with podcasts, you can really hear the differences in the different microphones people use; it's incredible.<br/>They're really comfortable for me.  I have a large head and I wear glasses half the time, and even while wearing glasses, I can wear these headphones for hours at a time with minimal fatigue.  The earpads and headband are nice and soft, and the earpads reach all the way around large ears.  My partner has a small head and seems to find them comfortable, though they can slide around a bit on their head.  When I'm moving around a lot, I find I need to really tighten them up to get them to grip when I tilt my head down.  This became a non-issue for me as I got accustomed to them.<br/>Due to the flexible nature of the design, they are especially floppy.  You really can't pick them up quite like normal headphones, and putting them on is necessarily a two-handed affair.  The first time I picked these up at a demo, they seemed to abandon my hands.  You can't pick them up by one earcup and slip them on one-handed.  I find I have to grab both cups or both ends of the headband and then put them on.  But that's intentional.  Sometimes you want to just pick up one ear and listen for just a second, like when you're trying to dial in something in a recording.  For that purpose, the rest of the headphones fall to the side out of the way, and it's very convenient.  I was actually frustrated by this at first, but after using them for some time in several different scenarios, I'm glad for the flexibility.<br/>Other design notes: they seem durable and they've never appeared to even start breaking.  I am gentle with my equipment, and I kept from forcing the hinges when the headphones would flop out of my hands for the first week I used them.  I absolutely love that they fold up.  This is eminently convenient for putting them in bags and taking them places.<br/>The sound isolation is pretty good.  Even on airplanes I've found that I don't have to turn the volume up too much.  They easily block out conversations and even that one guy who doesn't know he talks too loudly.  Adding bass seems to help this.<br/>The cable situation is pretty bad.  It's kind of weird to include two giant studio-length cables with headphones that will also be bought by average consumers.  That being said, I bought a compatible braided cable on Amazon for $12, and it's awesome.  It locks into the headphones, it's just the right length for everyday use, and it seems really durable.  You'll probably want to buy one if you ever move your headphones from your desk.<br/><br/>I really love these headphones, and I highly recommend them for all purposes.

I know the frequency response is TECHNICALLY better on the M50x, but for me I just like the sound of the M40x way more. I would definitely recommend trying to find some place to listen to both of them in person and making your decision, but for the price difference I would recommend these over the M50x especially to someone on a tighter budget. I've been using these for well over a year now and I love them, never had a single issue. The locking headphone cable is a nice touch, and I appreciate how long the cable is and that you also get a telephone-style coiled cable as well if you need a shorter one.<br/><br/>The only thing that is annoying about them is that you can't just use any standard 3.5mm cable, it seems like it HAS to be the ones that come with these. IF you're someone who gets cables shredded for one reason or another frequently, you may want to either stay away from these and go with something that can be replaced more easily, or buy a bunch of extras if AT sells them individually (I honestly haven't checked). If you take care of your gear though, I really don't think you'll have an issues.

I bought these 4 maybe 5 years ago, its my first time investing in a pair of Audio Technica's but i used to own a pair of Sony MDR750's which at the time for the price i did not believe you could get a better pair of headphones for the price range, however after 5 years of use i'm here to tell you that so these have been the best pair of headphones i've ever owned, i use them for everything, in music production, balancing and mixing / mastering, casual listening, and i take them on my 8 mile runs and get them dirty ... Never once have they failed on me, nothing has broken off, and they sound as good as they day i got them, they fit snug over my ears like a glove and they don't abuse my ears after long sessions and honestly if you want even better ear support you can buy custom earcups that'll really bring the experience of owning these ten fold but the standard ones are well built, the sound is leveled and there's not much coloration going on giving you a crystal clear yet loud full surround sound, the clarity is honestly really impressive, in most cases headphones that are acoustically flat that deliver an honest clear sound tend to lack in the low end but these are the exception to the rule, honestly i'm actually thinking of buying a second pair just to stash away just in case but to be honest i don't know when that day will come because no matter the time of day, no matter where i am, no matter what i ask of it ... it steps up to the plate and continues to deliver a quality sound that just blows my mind, i cannot believe the price on these pair of headphones ... I feel like the only person who got cheated here was Audio Technica for the price lol.

There are more expensive and better monitoring headphones out there but this has a nice balance of frequencies, is comfortable and affordable.  I tried the Sony but the highs were too sibilant and painful after a time.  I could wear these for hours.  The variety of cords and the pouch are nice features.  The detachable cords mean that a fault in the cord doesn't mean you have to buy new headphones, just the cord.  I use them for practice with my keyboards, harmonicas and vocals.  I even used them in a performance and they blocked out the stage sounds nicely.  The sound on stage was very loud and these helped. Highly recommended.
----
I've used the M50Xs for the past 6 years and they've been incredible, but they're now super glued in 3 spots due to heavy use. It was time for a new pair, and I've read and heard that the M40Xs are better, if not on par with the M50Xs. It's only been a few days with them, but I have to say, it's all true. All the sound quality, comfortability, and closed-back noise isolation is here for $50 less. I'm not really an audiophile, but I like music and I feel like I'm actually able to pick up more detail on these than my M50Xs. My main use for these is gaming, and they have great directional imaging for footsteps and gunshots and whatnot. If you're on the fence between the 40s and the 50s, save the money! Get these, you won't be disappointed.
----
I use these with my digital piano.  They are comfortable and the sound is accurate and without any change.  The over-the-ear style keeps out sufficient household noise and there isn't much bleed of the piano to others in the next room.  I like the straight cord which I can tuck behind me.  The curled was a bit too heavy for me.
----
Love these! If I wear them for a few hours on end, they do get a little sweaty on the cups. They are also a little heavy compared to other headphones I've tried, but comfortable still. The two cables are great, and I love the sound quality for gaming, video editing, listening to music, watching movies, etc.
----
I've purchased 2 pairs of these so far and they both broke in exactly the same place and both just a few months after the 2-year warranty expired.<br/><br/>Sound quality is great, they felt really "tinny" when I first started using them, but that had more to do with me being used to really bass boosted headphones before.<br/><br/>They're pretty comfortable for extended use, although I did replace the ear cups with velvet ones because plastic ear cups have never been my thing.<br/><br/>I'd say it's a good purchase, if you don't mind replacing them every 2 years.
----
The clamping force is a bit too much and squeezes your head. That gets tiring after 2-3 hours. The supplied cables are way too long, but you can get a shorter cable here on Amazon.
----
the sound is great, but it isn't "professional"

I have found these headphones to be great personally and I am unsure why others have said they are poor. The sound quality is good and they have bass which is nice. The fact they are deep in the ear means they are good at blocking out the sound around you which means you can enjoy your music more
----
Nice little product, use them on my Walkman, but also plug them into my phone, excellent sound quality, and light and easy to use, comes highly recommended, if you like me love to listen to music out and about, really good value for money

Comfortable fit that is flexible enough for sudden movements, good quality sound - i would buy again

It seems like as technology advances these hook earphones get worse, I had to get these since Philips no longer sell their SHS8100 model &amp; my last pair are showing signs of dying (low static in the left ear).<br/><br/>I listen to ASMR for relaxation so being able to hear clear directional sound is important to me, the JVC HA-EC10-B-E Sports In-Ear Earphones have a muffled sound to them &amp; aren't very good at seperating sounds.<br/>Maybe they have too much bass or too few channels? I don't know, either way the search for a replacement of my old Philips continues.<br/><br/>Update: I've tried to get used to them but they have absolutely terrible audio quality, it's a shame budget options are so bad these days.

I’ve been looking for a pair of noise-cancelling headphones and came across these by the recommendation of a friend. I bought these headphones for the purpsoe of studying, productivity, and traveling. I’m not super tech savvy, but I really enjoyed using it for the past few months.<br/><br/>Perfect for maintaining focus &amp; personal quiet time: Like I said, I’m not super tech savvy. These headphones are super easy to use. I just turn it on and I feel like I can tackle on any assignment, essay, or research project. With so many things going on at a university setting, it helps me focus on the task at hand. I think that the ANC tap feature is pretty cool. It’s really convenient when I’m at a study group. Whenever someone needs to say something to me, I just tap the sides and I can hear what they have to say without having to take off my headphones constantly. I also really like taking these headphones with me for road trips. When I’m not driving, I like to take a nap while my friend/boyfriend drives. The headphones cancel out the loud road and air vents. It makes falling asleep a lot much easier because I’m so sensitive to sound.<br/><br/>Comfort: The memory foam padding makes it super comfy to wear even after long periods of time. Other headphones I used to wear would start hurting after 2-3 hours due to the headband and the ear cups. Most headphones tend to have smaller ear cups and it can get pretty painful if you have lots of ear piercings like me. These headphones have large ear cups and encompass my whole ear, perfect for my pierced ears.<br/><br/>Superb Sound Quality: I like to listen to music while I study or when I go on walks. I love how dynamic it sounds, especially the bass. I’m not sure how to explain it, but the music sounds more detailed? In comparison to other headphones and earbuds I’ve tried. Podcasts also sound amazing as well. It makes voices super clear, almost as if the podcast person is in the same person as you.<br/><br/>Long Battery life: These headphones have a surprisingly long battery life. I use the headphones for about 1-2 hours a day and I could go up to 3 weeks without needing to charge.<br/><br/>Pairing Issues: The only issue that I’m currently having is pairing the headphones with my 2013 MacBook air via Bluetooth. Not sure if it’s a software problem or my MacBook is too old (it’s pretty ancient), but it doesn’t seem to show up on my devices. However, it’s not a big problem because I use the cable that it comes with.

Have been looking for a good quality ANC headphone for noisy environment for a while. I need an extra pair when working in server room which the fan noise is quite loud. After some research, this Philips H9505 came across and I really like the design. Hence decided to give it a try. Here are some Pros and Cons:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>1.Really good noise cancelling effect, the Hybrid ANC feature works really well on cancelling fan noise.<br/>2.Awaressness mode has the right amount of ambient sound balance, not overly amplifying whispers as some other expensive ANC headphones tends to.<br/>3.Very comfortable headphone padding. A good whole-day listening companion.<br/>4.Touch pad works! I'm not a touch pad fan generally but the one on this headphone works as a charm!<br/>5.For the sound, the tune skewed heavily towards Bass. I'm impressed by the extension of the low end, probably contributed by the 40mm driver. Maybe a bit too heavy from my taste but this works well in noisy environment.<br/>6.Solid construction and great design, built with premium materials. Head band, padding, driver housing, hinge...etc. I also like the how it looks but this might be subjective. :P<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>1.The headphone buttons has that cheap plastic look. Although the buttons are small and low profile, but I mean come on, it's like a Maserati with Chrysler parts on console.<br/>2.The App doesn't really do anything, hence lack of ability to personalize frequency response. A multiband EQ would be nice. Hope Philips will update the app in the future to support this feature.<br/><br/>Overall a solid headphone, some details could have been better but I'm satisfied as is. This will be my working horse for office use.<br/><br/>Edit 6/29/2021<br/><br/>Philips headphone app now works with my H9505. Now I can toggle different level of ANC. Also got the EQ adjustment feature which is the most important to me. For some reason the custom EQ setting reset itself on the APP. Setting seems to be preserved in the headphone but not quite sure. Hope this could be fix soon.

I wear these when I cut grass so I can listen to music and not hear the roar of my mower

Honestly, these things are terrific.  I don't say that lightly.  I bought the Hesh ANC, Bose, Soundcore, you name it.<br/><br/>These have the best features, the best sound, and the best noise cancelling (Hesh is #2 for NC).<br/><br/>In terms of features, I love the touch control right headset.  Tap to play/pause, swipe up for volume up, down for volume  down, and to the right to skip.  Great feature that makes using them soooo much easier.<br/><br/>But these truly shine in the noise cancellation.  You can barely hear any ambient sounds with it on (don't worry, there is an ambient sound feature too).  I was really impressed compared to the other headsets I tried.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you have a fairly big/long head, these are the headphones for you.  They "extend" more than any other I tried, so the top of your head does not end up in pain from the headband after an hour.  They are way more comfortable in that regard than any other set.  And overall, the comfort level on the actual ears is great too -- because your ears will fit fully inside the foam.<br/><br/>Everyone has an opinion, but I find it hard to believe that anyone would rate these anything but 5.
----
I know this sounds strange, having owned the best in the market, sony XM3 and XM4, to say that I prefer the H9505's ANC performance over Sony's, so bear with me while I explain.<br/><br/>Sony's ANC offers top of the line performance but it is so aggressive that it makes me feel like I'm in a vacuum, with my eardrums feeling hollow or air being sucked out at the same time, that sensation is strange to describe but present after using for about 3 hours straight<br/>there is definitely some fatigue factor there<br/><br/>With Philips H9505's ANC, it feels a bit more natural, not as powerful but enough so the background noise isn't disturbing me<br/>I feel that this does it just right<br/>the app also offers 2 levels of ANC control + adaptive ANC so essentially 3 levels<br/><br/>despite not having aptx HD and such codecs, i still find the audio quality above average. they must have done a good job with the drivers and chip tuning<br/>app does give you some more controls on the equalizers but I'm having problems saving the settings<br/><br/>this headset feels premium, build and finish is top notch, comparable to my sonys<br/><br/>over, for $100+ less than sony, this is the best bang for the buck for premium ANC headset that you can purchase!!!
----
This review is for the Philips H9505. I really thought these would be good considering they came out at almost $300. When they went down to $250 I was tempted but at the current price of $148 I went for it and they are not even worth this price. The noise cancellation is actually very good but it changes the sound quite a bit when on and switching to off. On the sound is neutral but a little shouty. With the ANC off the sound better but too bassy and muffled. They are also uncomfortable. My ears hurt after about 30 minutes. They are a small over ear. The biggest problem was the Bluetooth connection cuts out for about 1-2 seconds every 3-4 songs, sometimes more frequently. I exchanged them and the problem exist with the new set. Wired they sound decent but I will be sending these back. So far the best BT headphones I have tried are the Jabra Elite 85H. They are a little bright sounding but are punchy and sound great but no connectivity issues. I am happy with those. I have tried many BT headphones and the Jabra's so far are the best.
----
What I don't like is the left side has some weird clicking sound. But I can't hear it when I'm listening to music,therefore doesn't interrupt the sound quality.
----
I bought the headphones almost a year ago and in the beginning they worked ok. After around 3 months they randomly stopped pairing with devices. At this point they only sometimes connect to my phone, but never to my computer or tablet (even though they did so before). Quite disappointing.
----
head phones are ok for the price.  does ok with noise canceling unless it's real noisy out.  tried use when riding tractor, but was to noisy to hear. ok around house or others.
----
Maybe I just have a big head, but these (even with the over-the-ear design) feel like a vice grip on my head. What makes them even worse is that I wear glasses, and get a headache after wearing these for more than 30 minutes. I was hoping for a cloth-like fabric for the cushions, but they're not. So again around that 20- 30 minute mark my ears and the skin around my ears begin to just sweat profusely. Everything else (battery life, sound quality, and the noise cancellation) so far are fantastic. These are just really small for me, and for the price tag I feel a bit ripped off.

I got these so that my small ears would be completely engulfed in the headphones, and they are, but my thin wired frame glasses don't sit normally on my face when I wear the headphones. The foam cups don't adjust like you'd think foam would, but instead push the arms of my glasses into my head, making the bridge of my glasses float on my face instead of resting on my nose.It uncomfortable &amp; not grate for seeing. The sound is fine, but I'm not really picky about it, just wanted basic headphones &amp; these seem pretty basic. The thin flexible plastic "skin" on the ear cups is really very very thin &amp; I imagine that it will not last long but will see. I have a small head for an adult &amp; these fit well without uncomfortable pressure (unless I wear my glasses!) I Am satisfied overall, just wish they worked better with my glasses.<br/>Update : I replaced the ear covers with thick angled velour covers  &amp; they are much cooler than the plethor &amp; work better with glasses, still not perfect, but better. these headphones are lighter than most over the ear headphones that I've tried, though others have better sound, these are what i use all the time because of the comfort. After 2 years of everyday use use they are holding up fine
----
I am accustomed to audiophile level sound,  and these headphones do not deliver in that haughty realm of pipe smoking, 'golden eared,' pretense. However, as everyday headphones they serve admirably. The sound seems a bit compressed and lacking at both ends of the audible spectrum, but I have found no headphones in this price range to offer the full range and dynamics of ostensibly better models.<br/><br/>There are lots of headphones in this price range that I have found to be really harsh with glaring faults in some or all part of what us humans can hear. These headphones do not suffer from this sin.<br/><br/>The quality seems pretty good save for the cord, which my young cat(he'd kill me if I called him a kitten) found delightfully chewable. Voodoo(the cat) chewed through the casing in a week. The headphones failed due to cord issue not much later, so I soldered up the break in the wire.  That's the reason for the one star knock-off. I have other headphones here and their cords are undeniably more robust.<br/><br/>If you have critters that chew, there may be better options in this price range. If not, then I have no reservations about recommending this set.
----
These are the best budget headphones I've ever used.  Better than expected sound quality and bass and they don't get uncomfortable when worn for extended periods. I bought these cause I wanted something cheap but kinda decent after losing my Sony headphones. These aren't my sonys, but for $10 I'd definitely recommend these if you're on a budget.
----
For the price these are much better than I expected. Yes, they are made of relatively inexpensive materials, however I get really good sound from them. I only just started using them so I am unable to speak to their durability. They do fit my ears comfortably even after semi-prolonged usage. The longest I've worn them was about three plus hours. Other earphones I've had actually hurt, these my only substantive complaint is I got sweaty behind my ears, but that is not unexpected.
----
After 2.5 years, I decided to write a review for these headphones. I have a much better pair of closed-back headphones that sound much better. Compared to my more expensive Tascam headphones these sound just average. Thing is, these headphones weigh next to nothing and they are comfortable. I've been using them for more than 2 years, so the quality is good enough. I wear them off and on all day long.<br/><br/>The weight and the comfort are the reason I wear them. I think of them as being a good value.
----
If you have an equalizer in windows, you can certainly tweak this.. But standalone, they sound slightly muffled like it's completely missing tweeter<br/><br/>* Update: After 4 months still working good, though one cushion has slipped off.  I was able to slide it back on, but this is annoying.  I really wish a headphone manufacturer would design a more reliable way of attaching cushions more securely than a tiny clip that breaks off, or an elastic band that tucks into a crevice.  Still pretty happy with my purchase, but I think I would gladly pay double for a headphones I knew were built right.
----
Decent low quality, not built to last. Yet pretty decent for a spare set or a “starter set”.
----
I’ve brought these headphones three times. I record music, edit music and love listening to music. I’ve used many headphones throughout my years. These are great for the price but DON’T LAST . If you take good care of them and are very careful, they might last a year. They are NOT DURABLE or built to last. After a few months with moderate use, you have to hold the cord and jack a certain way for them to work. Very frustrating.<br/><br/>positives: Good sound quality for the price. Very comfortable.<br/><br/>Negatives: You will not have working headphones for long. It begins with having to hold the cord a certain way and ends with only working on one ear.
----
Best budget headphones. The amazon product detail does not show the entire spec. It has only 35mm driver but sound pretty decent. The earpads are comfortable for short usage.
----
These things are great. I use them every week for our livestream at church so that I can listen to the mix in the stream and make sure that we don’t have too much vocals or piano or anything like that. They usually stay comfortable right up to the end. The cord is a great length and the quality is awesome. I’m sure that you could find better ones that cost more but I love these and the price was great.<br/>If you use headphones all day everyday you may want to look for a different pair but I think these are great.

Had a very nice pair of Bose that got "borrowed" from me on an international flight, decided I wasn't going to spend that much on another temporary set of NC earphones, I found this model by Sony.  It was about $50 at the time, which was only a quarter of my first (now traveling somewhere without me) NC headset.  I really like the simplicity and affordability of them, haven't lost these because they look so plain :-)<br/><br/>Sound is clear, sound reduction is decent, have recommended them to several cabin crew and fellow passengers, even bought a couple sets to give my parents when they retired and took the 'round the world' dream trip they'd been saving and planning for, having NC headsets was equally appreciated by them!<br/><br/>They do not come with any sort of stowage bag included, so recommend you grab something appropriate to keep the kit (headset and cord, it's included legacy airline twin-plug adapter, and a spare battery) neatly contained, rather than tossed loosely in your carry-on bag.  I found a very simple cloth "cosmetic brush" bag that fits the bill perfectly, YMMV.<br/><br/>I mention these have a couple minor drawbacks...<br/><br/>First, if you're looking for Bluetooth or wireless, these are wired use only.  On the other hand, their cord and simple appearance also makes these look to be an ordinary set of headphones and not a desired theft item.<br/><br/>Second, these are not rechargeable, and it is easy to forget about powering down after a flight, so good idea to carry an extra AAA battery in your kit.  On the other hand, the power switch is not easily bumped, so you won't accidentally turn them on in your bag, and the battery drain is rather low so that even after a couple days sitting "ON" in my bag, they were still working.<br/><br/>Overall, a very worthy purchase, and an item I recommend to others, though I think Sony could have stepped them up a notch by giving them rechargeable capability, via USB cable or such, and knock off a star for that reason in hopes they consider this feedback as a suggestion of how to improve an already decent product -- sometimes the little bits of customer input is all it takes to effect change, right?  This whole BT trend, not a huge fan myself, but point it out for those that want BT connectivity on everything.
----
I was pleasantly surprised by this headset. I usually use Bose's $300+ noise cancelling headphones, but wanted something smaller and lighter. These headphones muffle noise, but don't entirely cancel it. They are on the ear, which is new to me, and I like it very much. Good enough sound quality, light weight, stays on my head while I move around with an MP3 player in my pocket. I am so glad I bought these, and got a very good price that day. A very happy music lover and audio book lover. Thanks, Bose. But they aren't noise cancelling, so I took off a couple of stars for the misleading description.

Love these things. I use them all the time.
----
I bought these back in 2016 and have used them on and off since then. Most recently as a college student, driving my need for wireless option.<br/><br/>SOUND QUALITY: While the sound quality is adequate, I am a person who loves heavy bass, which this does not give, but the sound quality overall is pretty good.<br/><br/>NOISE CANCELLATION: It also does not completely cancel out noice, but does muffle/buffer it. In Starbucks, I had to turn up the volume on my computer to 75% to drown out talking. Likewise, poolside at the YMCA, I also have to amp up the volume to get any true buffering from the high sound. I am easily distractible so these are not ideal for noise distractions.  Even at home with dogs and kids, I find that, no matter what, I have to amp up the volume for buffering, otherwise I hear quite a bit.  I don't notice a significant difference in turning off the ANC. The same goes for vacuuming, yard work (such as using a blower) and mowing the lawn.<br/><br/>COMFORT: The headphones are over ear and pretty comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. I have yet to experience significant fatigue from it.  I don't notice any extensive sweating while wearing them, either, which some have said is an issue with over the ear headphones. Granted, I'm not sleeping in them, either.<br/><br/>DURABILITY: Over the several affordable on/over ear headphones I purchased for my daughters' use with online work, these were the ones she kept coming to and the only ones that have held up over the years. The cord is pretty durable, especially since I don't have a case for it and it often gets tossed into a drawer or backpack willy-nilly (yes, an outdated term, I know).<br/><br/>COMPARABILITY: I have tried the Bose SoundLink II and Beats Solo3, both wireless headphones. If you are looking for comparable sound, you won't find it. Both Bose and Beats have these headphones beat, as would be expected based on price! However, I see quite a few complaints regarding durability of the material over time. I have no experience with comparison of Bose or Beats as these are recent purchases from family members. I can attest to the durability of my Sony headphones.<br/><br/>CONVENIENCE: I like that my Sony headphones can work well with my 2018 MacBook Pro, as Apple didn't see fit to change the headphone jack for any of their computers from the 3.5mm jack to a lightning jack. I use the adapter on my iPhone and it works fine. I've used these headphones to run on a treadmill several times and they stay put. I'm not running sprints or marathons, though. However, they are wired, and wired ONLY. Meaning I can't be wireless, and they don't connect to my iWatch.<br/><br/>For convenience due to connectivity with all of my devices, I would say that Beats Solo3 Wireless has everything I need, since I have all Apple devices and I really like having everything working together. Even my Alexa devices and Alexa Compatible plugs work harmoniously together and with my Apple devices. As a result, I will be looking for a wireless option that offers good durability and superior noise cancelling capabilities, though I won't be getting rid of these, as they really are great quality headphones, as expected with Sony (considering I grew up in a time where Sony was considered right up there, before Bose became a more well-known entity in the market).

I'm a  classical musician that listens to everything. I own the $15 Koss UR 18 ( comfy and with decent bass for the price) which are good at their price range. I also own $75  Senheisser HD 280. They are bulky with very good passive isolation, and more natural sound.<br/>I had the $450 Beats Pro for a while, and they were great for popular music , with control talk, great bass, and superior to all other beats.<br/>Now about these pair or Sonys:<br/>Sound: they have more bass and treble than the Senheisser 280, but these Sonys sound a bit hollow. For the price range it is Pretty good, I guess. Nothing impressive.  I like their boomy bass for some styles of music.<br/><br/>Isolation: They reduced the bathroom fan and the bus ramble very noticeably. Voices are softer but at the same time you can hear words more clearly. So keep those differences in mind.<br/>(** update: two days later, it's been a few times that people talked to me in the house while listening to angry rock at 40% of volume and I did not hear them at all).<br/>Having said that, they're not as good as the Bose QC 25, but they are exactly  ten times cheaper.<br/><br/>Portability: They fold flat and small in a way that is super compact. No bag included.<br/>It uses a AAA battery , easy to use, and it comes with one.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>No control to pick up calls.<br/>Trebles get harsh after an hour or so, and it hurts a bit, unless you can equalize it well. Sound can be a bit hollow in the middle.<br/><br/>Comfort:<br/>They are very comfortable even with glasses on. My head is small though.<br/><br/>I paid $30 for them, and sometimes I prefer them over the Senhheisser hd 280 to listen to music on the go, specially bass oriented music.<br/>The Senheisser are better at blocking higher pitch sounds ( ppl , tv, etc) bc they are big and press against your head, so I kept them for those situations.<br/>These Sonys have the *active* noise canceling , which improves their sound. &gt;&gt;&gt;They still work without it, though. So you can listen even without batteries. Sound loses boom and volume, but they work.<br/>I'm pretty happy with them for the price.<br/> Note:<br/>When  I tried the $300 Bose Quiet comfort 20 the store went silent. Bass was not impressive. These under $50 Sony pair are probably not as good at isolating ( a 25% less, maybe?) but they are so much  cheaper at Best Buy or here,  and smaller. The bass is sweet, too.<br/>For a cheap option in casual portable listening with isolation, I'd give them a try. If you're an audiophile, or listen to classical exclusively, keep looking.<br/>I hope it helps!

Wear them at the gym. Can not hear people next to me talking for an hour. Can not hear the loud music over the sound system. Can not hear the guy vacuuming all around me. CAN hear the music from my I-Phone loud and clear!
----
Bought these for lawn mowing. Best pair I've found for under $50 that will actually keep the mower sound to a minimum. Would buy again
----
can enjoy using laptop without having to put loud
----
All features work well. Will buy again.

This is exactly what I was looking for! It has a great sound. I take them everywhere. They fold nicely into my bag and perfect for studying, cleaning, and traveling. AND they have a wireless option. The battery life is AMAZING!
----
It's bigger than I expected but, they're pretty good.
----
There is a bass button on the thing. It makes no difference in any bass boost of any kind. You press it, nothing changes. I wonder if it works at all.<br/><br/>The headset is nice and loud thats for sure. It gives bass but not heavy bass like when i bought these AWIA classic headset noise cancellation headphones. They were great. They had loud bass, and the noise you cant hear it bleed out of the headset. RIP AWIA.<br/><br/>As for noise cancellation, its not. Its better than other chinese made headsets but even those give out better bass.<br/><br/>The headset is better than my others as far as being more clean and loud, and gives (some) bass but nothing you would expect from other better and more expensive brands.<br/><br/>So i gave an honest rating. Buy it if you are on a budget and if you dont care for bass too much. It gives bass but not that button and the bass is not nice and bassy.<br/><br/>Even tried to tweak the EQ on the computer, it did nothing to the headphones.<br/><br/>One star for bass because it sounds no different than a cheap chinese headset but the loud clear quality makes it up.
----
I used it to listen to my lectures while my family were doing other activities, great sound, noise cancellation. I didn’t have an opportunity to test the bass.

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Se escucha muy bien, buena calidad.<span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden">
----
Poor mic quality. Most people had to have me repeat things several time to hear me even when talking loudly.<br/>Decently comfortable to wear.<br/>Sound is average at best.<br/>Bass function? It has a button but I can’t notice any difference.
----
<span class="cr-original-review-content">La batería dura muchísimo, con un uso cotidiano, me refiero a usarlos aproximadamente unas 5 horas diarias que es en el trabajo, la batería me duro más de dos semanas, el sonido lo escucho bien con iPhone, pero los probé con un Xiaomi y se escucha mejor, con cable se escucha muy bien también, el bass me hubiera gustado más potente pero son muy buenos audífonos sin duda<span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden">

Pretty good for VR, be mindful that some head straps won’t work for these. The cords are also at different lengths
----
These work great with either In-the-ear or in-the-canal hearing aids!  No feedback and for the price, pretty amazing sound quality.  They look like they’re made somewhat cheaply and I expect a wire to short out eventually, but what do you expect for 12 bucks?  So small and portable, great to carry on commercial airplanes or to use for zoom meetings on the go with portable laptop and decent sound for music.  Won’t work with behind-the-ear hearing aids though.

 I bought these to replace ones that Walmart stopped carrying. Panasonic has discontinued this item. These came from Korea.<br/>Earbuds hurt my ears, so these are a great lightweight option, especially if wearing for long lengths of time.<br/>Very inconspicuous for live streaming or video calls.
----
They come in a small beautiful plastic packaging with instructions in Japanese. It turns out they are tiny - foam has less than 1.5 inches in diameter. Actually I have pretty small ears and still not covering much with them. Also, they look pretty fragile. It seems one has to be super careful to avoid damage. They are cheap in the end...<br/>I find the sound is not good, specifically for a region in the high frequencies that is overboosted. This brings a harsh sound and makes the S's of human voice sound too accentuated. It causes listening fatigue. Often it forces me to lower the volume, like these headphones are shouting to you.<br/>You wouldn't like to listen to music that already features some kind of distortion with these headphones. It's annoying.<br/>I've had clip headphones in the past which are more comforable and deliver a better sound than these ones. Unfortunately they are not very easy to find in the market.
----
These are the headphones I use at work. they have fantastic sound and are very comfortable. If you don't like ear buds then you'll like these. My only complaint is the phone cushions fall apart after a while and it doesn't seem replacements are available. But for the price and quality they're a good buy.
----
I would invest in the KOSS brand over this and pay the extra few dollars for comfort and sound quality,<br/>but these are good for something cheap and easy.

 Great for 6 and 8 year olds during Google meets and homework. We had an older version where the foam came off but was still usable... for years. This new version the foam is almost tucked and glued into the bud so its looking like the foam will not be coming off. Needed a new pair with a straight plug because the old pair had a right angle for the plug and did not fit the kids tablets. When I plug into my phone to hear music, it isn't the best quality I admit but we didn't purchase these for that reason. Prefect for ears that buds fall out of, especially for kids since these go around the top of their ear. Also, not too oooooh loud with is a plus for kids.  Also, they're not expensive so if the kids sit on them, I can afford to simply get a new pair. But the old pair/version has seriously lasted for over 10 years.
----
at this price cannot beat the quality
----
These are similar to the original black version but for storing the right side is longer and gets tangled when wrapped with cable tie compared to original version with same length wires. Once you learn how to fit them on your ears they are very comfortable. Great sound especially good for podcasts and voice. I use these with smartphone radio that requires wire antenna. I also like that they don't irritate the inside of my ears like ear buds. Can also hear traffic etc.when walking.<br/>Ear piece covers wear out that's why I bought this new pair. All in all a very worthwhile purchase.

Good enough.
