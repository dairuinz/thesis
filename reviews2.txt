They are great for the price and fit perfectly for a guy with a small head
Wife loves these for plugging into Roku remote to watch TV when I have to be asleep early.  Very comfortable. Good sound quality for the price.
Excellent quality, sound, and yet, they are not over the ear.  Maybe for a child or chimpanzee, but not for me.
A very short review: These are wonderful headphones if you are not looking for sophisticated headphones. These headphones are straightforward just perfect for my goal: Being able to listen audio files on my computer.
Buenos!!!
My only problem is the 'left' and 'right' indicating lables are too small and dark and hard to read. My meditation cd's require left/right so it is important to me that it is placed correcly. It is hard to tell which way it is supposed to fit. But, once I am wearing them, they are comfortable and have good sound.
GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY, CORD IS BULKY
These are so nice to listen to music with!  You can hear so much bass and so many more midtones.  They don't cancel noise as well as I'd like, though.  All in all, a great set of headphones for the price.
I like the way they fold up to take up less room. Would be nice if it had a volume control but you can do that from the device.
My son is autistic and is rough on headphones. His last pair made it through his entire school year last year and mostly through the summer.  Because he is so rough, this is pretty impressive. Just bought our second pair for this school year. Highly recommend.

They seem really clear and when in restaurant blocked out surrounding noise when listening to sound on YouTube vid my kiddo was showing me. I had to shift off ear to hear him across the table as well.I don't often buy a second something of items, but this I did for another of my kids when he was impressed by sound.  He listens to music and gaming and casts. He is adult kid...quite large...a melon head...I can say that being his mom. So fits many a size head.Tbh...I  will have to pay more attention to bass.These are a nice for those not fond of ear buds nor wanting huge cups on their ears.
I don't like earbuds and find most other headphones to be too large plus heavy. I love to listen to podcasts and these are ideal for that because they are comfortable. I wish they would make an upgraded version with a more accurate sound (for music), mic, remote, and detachable cable. I've gone through 3 of these because the cable sometimes get accidently snagged to things, messing it up. I would gladly pay double the price if they did this. Nevertheless, these are one of the best values out there.
I am hard of hearing and like that the "ears" on these swivel.  I just use for tv and youtube. I can put these on and flip the headphones out. This allows the sound to be directed to my ear but I can still hear the phone, doorbell, meowing cat or conversation in the room. Ear buds, over the ear phones or TV Ears block all that. They are cheap and don't last forever. I get six to twelve months out of them. Weakest point is where the wires enter the headphone.
The sound quality is better than I expected for the price. The bass is very good and the sound is crisp and clear. They fit perfectly over my ears and are comfortable to wear. They're even comfortable to wear with glasses.
Bought this because Dad needed an over-the-ears headphone set that wouldn't interfere with hearing aids. He likes to walk and listen to music. He says it does the job but is "tinny", which sounds to me like it doesn't replicate the bass and is probably letting in too much outside noise. However I knew when I bought it that it was not a perfect solution, it was a low-cost option. He will probably replace it at some point but he's still using it so it can't be all bad.
I just bought a new set of these after about 5 years of using the last set. That's a lot longer then I expected these to last for the price. They aren't bad quality, and very comfortable. The noise quality isn't bad for the price, cancellation? Eh, it's okay. Again, for the price, these are great. Lasted many years and they do their job.
These headphones are quite a bargain for the price. Nothing fancy but lightweight and a really full sound with good bass. I've been using them for a week and already ordered a second pair for back up.
My husband has hearing aids, and I didn‚Äôt know how he was going to be able to hear on our tour in Israel. Let me explain. The tour guide uses a ‚Äòwhisper‚Äô microphone that the group participants hear by plugging earphones into their whisper device. How could my husband use earphones when he needed to have his hearing aids in place? Then I got this idea. He used these lightweight headphones with the whisper device, and he didn‚Äôt have any trouble or interference with his hearing aids! We had a great trip.
I only keep ordering these because I sit on them or step on them and break them. For my use, they have just the right EQ. Love that they are so light that I can fall asleep with them on in bed, even lying on my side with one ear piece pushing into the pillow.
I purchased these headphones to use on an 11.5-hour overseas flight. They plugged into the plane's entertainment system just fine and I had two blissful flights. I'd always hated the cheap ear buds the airline handed out, and these headphones made my flights so much more pleasurable. The sound quality was great. For such a reasonable price, I was really impressed!

Oh boy are these cheap, and that is not a bad thing.I've been using these a couple of weeks now and it's incredible. Now I'm sure what I'm getting out of this is what people call the "v sound" with boosted top and bottom end, but it's some of the most incredible sound I've gotten from a pair of headphones. I'm not an audiophile. As long as what I'm using isn't bluetooth I'm generally fine, but I'm still going to love a real good sound.I've had headphones more expensive than these that both fit and sounded worse than these.The main things I'm worried about are the wire and how strong the headphones themselves are. I'll have to be careful with the wire for sure, but these aren't going anywhere that anything could possible snap them.Noise cancelling? Nah man. They don't let everything in by any means, they're not open back. It's not letting everything in and it's not letting everything out. But I hear more things through these than I have in like the last 5 pairs of headphones I've owned. This isn't a bad thing. I would often be hard to get the attention of because of it. I can hear what's going on around me but it's not going to ruin my experience with anything.You can do a lot worse than these for 30 bucks. You can do worse than these for 100 bucks. These are cheap headphones that don't sound like garbage and fit *comfortably* for cheap. Yeah I can safely recommend these.
I needed a pair of headphones for gaming, MacBook and TV. I am so pleased with these. I like a tight fit ‚úîÔ∏è, I like clear sound ‚úîÔ∏è, I like a longer cord ‚úîÔ∏è, Over ear ‚úîÔ∏è. Works well on all devices, even fits my phone and controller. Dropped my laptop and broke off the plug inüòûGot a new pair plus 1 more. My only issue is I wish they were a little louder sounding but that can be changed. Not fancy, quality headphones that work well.
These headphones were the first pair I bought for my PC setup and have been great. I use them for gaming primarily and music/video streaming. The sound quality is definitely great for its price and I have not had any issues with it since I bought it. The extra long cord is a huge plus as it allows me to move around my room without needing to take off my headphones. I would highly recommend this for people who need a cheap yet good set of headphones for gaming or music!
excellent for the price.  moderately comfortable,lightweight.  Slightly muffled hi end, solid bass,, good midrange.  Really long cable
I thought they were broken the first time I put them on and plugged them into my keyboard. I thought the sound was still coming out of the keyboard speakers. In fact, they were just so good that it fooled me. Great value and a name brand.
great  sound and quite comfortable
Good quality, inexpensive, good sounding headphones.
Have been in radio for several years, the Sennheiser headphones phones have been long part of my equipment. Now doing a podcast, the Sennheiser headphones continue to be impressive.
You get what you pay for. Decent sound with good volume. Construction seems flimsy (plastic, no braided cables), so I wouldn't recommend traveling with it. Cups just fit my ears, band is tight on my head. They wish great to hold me over until I can get something a bit more comfy
I bought these to replace an older pair of Sennheiser headphones. They are the most comfortable over ear headphones I have used so far with excellent sound quality. That's why I gave it five stars

Preface: I am teaching virtually from home, and I am on Zoom/Google Meet calls for 6 out of 8 hours every work day. I have a MacBook Air and a Pixel 3a. I listen to Spotify on my phone as well as through the app on my computer. I show YouTube videos during class as well and watch Netflix or Hulu while lesson planning. I also have a puppy that is very vocal (barkity bark bark), and I live in an apartment complex with normal-to-thin walls (hello, neighbors' dogs). Recently, my lovely pup, Sir Barks-a-lot (not his real name), ate my headphones, so I decided to buy these because they're massive and the likelihood of me losing these is minimal.Pros:- Very comfortable and lighter than I thought they'd be.- Easy to store, but big enough that I can't lose them.- Sounds good for a someone who just wants to hear stuff (read as: not super judgmental about sounds)- Battery life is dope (Charged it on Monday, and it is currently Wednesday, and I used them for 8 hours yesterday and most of today)- Sound range is fantastic. I can listen to my computer from the other side of my apartment (1700 sq ft. - I have roommates and live in Michigan. I'm not rich).- ANC and Hear-Through are neat features! Again, I'm not fancy, so I don't know if they're GREAT for ANC, but I think it's pretty cool that you can switch between modes! I CAN hear my doggo through them with ANC, but I cannot hear anything from any other room in the apt or my neighbors' apts.- Connected almost immediately to my phone (again, Pixel 3a), and some set up was required for my computer (MacBook Air)- When connected to Zoom on my computer, works very well!- When connected to Google Meet on my computer, works very well!- When connected to Spotify on my computer, works very well!- When connected to Spotify on my phone, works very well!- When calling on my phone, audio and mic sounded great!- I asked my students if I looked cool yet, and they didn't say no... but then again, they didn't say anything because they were all muted with their cameras off. So I'm taking that as a win.Cons (some of this might be user error):- Switching between apps/devices is not seamless. Examples:---- While I was on a Zoom and students were in breakout rooms, I received a call on my phone. When I tried to answer, the microphone and audio on both devices stopped working. I took the call with speaker phone, but when I went back to my Zoom, I couldn't hear my students, and they couldn't hear me. I turned off Bluetooth on both devices and taught the rest of class without headphones.---- While I was on a Google Meet, the Google Meet window was sending and receiving from my headphones, but when I opened Youtube in another tab, the audio was coming from my computer and not going to my headphones. When I hung up the Google Meet, I thought it would autocorrect, but I had to go into my System Preferences and change output to these headphones.---- When my computer is open and a Zoom meeting is happening, Spotify does not work on my phone. It will work from my computer, but I cannot control it from my phone.---- When I am listening to something in a Chrome tab (let's say, hypothetically, Bones on Hulu), and I go into a Zoom meeting, the audio changes (I don't know what happens, but the hypothetical show sounds fuzzier).---- I was on a Zoom, hung up, watched a few Youtube videos, went to the bathroom, and then hopped on another Zoom call, and the person on the other end said that there was loud buzzing and static that sounded like I was trying to blow out his eardrum.---- When switching audio from my computer to my phone, the volume went to max for Spotify, and when I turned it down, it would automatically go to max volume. I had to restart all devices because it was blowing out my eardrums.- My students tell me I sound fuzzy.- Setting up audio and microphone from my computer was a little cumbersome and required some trial and error.NOTE ONE: There was a software update that seemed to fix SOME (not all) of the issues!Overall, I really like these headphones. They can be frustrating sometimes, but overall, I am glad I got them. I can wrestle my dog while listening to my computer without fear of dragging my computer to the ground. They're big enough that I can find them, and my dog won't eat them... hopefully.WARNING (& UPDATE): if you have long hair, be careful! My hair got caught in the joint of the headphones and got pulled out :( I still like them though. Hair grows back.
Easy set up and great sound.  Loose fit on my head takes away the pluses here.  I do like them, but for the cost I would like a more snug fitting over the ear pair of headphones.
Sound is great.  Easy connection
Works as advertised
Was excited to get these based on independent reviews.  Cost not on the cheap side so expectations were set.  Not terrible, but on a lot of rock songs with any kind of bass it seems to just bottom out and you get a clunk sound... instead of a bump or booom with some tone its just flat and thunk/clunk. It can be distracting on songs that have a lot of range and emotion (Tool).  Would not really recommend. Or maybe my expectations were  a little high.
Good:- Best call quality overcall, you will be heard even better than regular headset- Battery life, you can use them around 3-4 days in the 8hours shift, it won't be a problem- Multipairing connection is good, I have my galaxy s20 connected and the laptop, I receive a call answering it directly from the headphones without disconnecting the laptop.- General good sound quality, it's not the wh-xm3-4 from sony, the Sony's would be a 9 and the Jabras are a 8-8.5- App from Jabra es very useful and you can adjust everything there.Things to improve:- The lack deep bass, and highs being wheezing, it's possible to change it in the app, but it doesn't 'fix' completely, it's not a bad experience but in the next version.-Weight distribution could be better, comparing to the Bose 700 or Wh-xm4 or xm3 the weight could be the same but the Jabras feels a little bit heavy in the cups.- Noise cancelling, the noise cancelling works and you can feel it, but maybe the voices still passes through the filters, comparing to the xm4/Bose 700, Jabras are a 7.5 and the Bose/Sony are a 9.If you are looking for a pair of headphones to use them working from home/remote but also want then to hear music or watch  a movie with good sound quality in your free time, this is the best option under 200 USD. They are not perfect, but for the price I got them (186 use) it's the best option, they are going to disappoint at all.
The sound quality, versatility and noise cancelation are easily the best you can get for this price. That being said, the software for this device is easily the worst Ive ever experienced. Be prepared to have to troubleshoot and find work arounds for some bugs.
Excellent sound fidelity. User friendly controls. Plenty of noise cancellation for airplane flights or mowing the lawn. Best headphones I‚Äôve ever owned.
These are great. I live in an apartment and got them so I wouldn‚Äôt bother my neighbors with loud tv. They work great and have insane battery life. So far I‚Äôve had them for about a month and only had to charge them once. Haven‚Äôt tried them for work on teams yet, will get back to you on that. Very comfy and easy to pair. So far so great.
I don't think you will find performance here with these headphones. Sure it can block out most noise, but any sound that is higher than a baby crying next room will not get blocked entirely. I doubt you can block much sound if you take these on airplanes. Otherwise, it got  a neutral sound, and bass. You can use the app to made adjustment to the bass, and tremble level. However, if you want to use these with computer, look elsewhere. These works only with smartphones, and tablets. These will crash if you listen with the provided AUX cable, which is short, and low quality, while having any ANC on. I have not tested if these will work with PC's bluetooth, but make sure your bluetooth is the fifth generation. If you going to use these with computer, you might want to try the Sony wh-1000xm4, instead.Update: I used these via an external bluetooth 5.0 adapter. Even though, I can listen normally with ANC on, the pitch is distorted on. You should buy these if you solely listening to music via your smartphone. Also it will not hurt to check to make sure the headphones are not damaged. My headphones was damaged, or possible a defect from manufacturing. I only discovered it when I extended the the arms out, and it came without an airplane adapter. Check thoroughly.

I‚Äôve been very impressed with my Beoplay H95 headphones, which I have been using for about 2 weeks. For context, I am a classical musician and record my own music. When researching BT ANC headphones, I sought out experiences by classical musicians, or people who listen to classical music, as the needs are different compared to other musical genres. Despite an extensive search I did not find much in this area so I am posting some of my experiences as they might be of interest to others.I use several different pairs of headphones, some for monitoring use in recording and editing, and others for sound checks and pleasure listening. It is unusual for any one headphone to serve all purposes! During recording, I generally use the tried and true and surprisingly inexpensive ubiquitous Sony MDR-7506 headphones for monitoring. Most agree that these are very detailed and help reveal all the ‚Äúwarts‚Äù during the recording process, which is essential. However, I feel their sound signature is very bright and frankly unpleasantly harsh so they are not ideal for pleasure listening. I also use some excellent higher end headphones including the Sennheiser 800s, along with the companion Sennheiser headphone amp HDV 820, for critical and pleasure listening, as well as the Audeze LCD-X headphones which I use as a reality check during the recording process as well as for pleasure listening.With that context, enter the Beoplay H95. I purchased these for pleasure and convenience listening ‚Äì as opposed to critical listening or recording - in a sometimes noisy home environment (lots of nearby heavy construction noise and leaf blowers nearly every day). I was seeking a pair of Bluetooth headphones with ANC that approached the higher fidelity of my other cans. After extensive reading of reviews of popular Bluetooth ANC headphones, for example Sony WH-1000XM4, Bose 700 and Apple Air Pods Max I decided to trial the Beoplay H95. Note that I did not audition these other lower cost headphones so I can‚Äôt realistically compare them to the Beoplay H95. However, I can compare the H95 to my higher end headphones and this may be of interest to some.Now, for additional important background, my use case is probably different than that of other headphone users. I don‚Äôt intend to use full size headphones walking about outdoors ‚Äì I use Apple Airpod Pros for this. I also don‚Äôt intend to use full size headphones with ANC on commutes or on planes. Again, I would use the Airpod Pros or an older pair of Bose wired QC20 earbuds for this. So ‚Äì my use case for a full size Bluetooth ANC headphone is for use indoors, freeing me from the cable tethering me to my good rig, listening for pleasure in a sometimes noisy environment. Other than ANC, sound quality is of paramount importance to me. Other features such as phone calls, apps, control gestures, voice control, are of secondary importance to me.I‚Äôve found the Beoplay H95 sound signature to be very neutral and transparent. While clearly not as fine as higher end - and more expensive - cabled headphones, the sound quality that the H95 offers is quite respectable. The soundstage is fairly expansive, and while it may not be as wide or deep as the Sennheiser 800s (which is unusually vast) ‚Äì the H95 soundstage is quite generous. This makes spatial location of different instruments, for example in an orchestra, better than in lesser headphones. The mid-upper frequencies are transparent and airy, and vocals, such as in classical art songs (e.g. lieder) sound very true and engaging. Instrumentals (piano, strings, orchestra) seem pretty accurate as well. Bass is tight and certainly present in sufficient quantity for classical music. It is not boosted or exaggerated as some might prefer for other genres of music. Recordings I‚Äôve made of myself (i.e. me as performer) also seem pretty accurate. Of course, when I compare the H95 sound to my good rig, the difference is readily apparent ‚Äì for example the Sennheiser 800s has a great deal more body, heft, clarity, liquidity, dynamic range and nuance where the H95 is a bit lighter weight, somewhat veiled, slightly grainy and compressed by comparison - but I feel overall the H95 does quite a very respectable job representing reality for a BT headphone.  Again, it is unreasonable to expect a BT ANC device to perform at the same level as much more expensive corded audiophile equipment. The H95 does come surprisingly close however!I have noticed what some others have called out, that to achieve decent listening volume, I need to dial the H95 up to >70% volume, which I feel is less than ideal and shouldn‚Äôt be necessary. For some softer classical tracks I need to dial it up to 90-100%. This suggests to me that there isn‚Äôt adequate headroom in the amplifier. The supplied USB-C to USB-A cable, intended for recharging the H95 battery, can also be used as a wired connection to a computer. In this case, the achievable volume is much improved compared to BT. I estimate that at 50% volume level in this wired setup is similar to 70-80% level in the BT configuration. A similar ‚Äúboost‚Äù in volume occurs when using the supplied 3.5mm cable to the source, be it my iPhone 11 (with a lighting to USB cameras adapter), or PC. I believe the sound quality is also improved using the USB-A to USB-C cable, perhaps because the digital signal from the PC is bypassing the DA conversion in the H95. Another factor in the low volume output of the H95 via Bluetooth from my iPhone is EQ. Usually I have this set on ‚ÄúClassical‚Äù as that is the majority of my listening. However, I found that the EQ setting ‚ÄúNone‚Äù (or ‚ÄúFlat‚Äù which seems equivalent) is still excellent sonically for my needs, and the volume is noticeably louder.I did have occasion to use the H95 in a phone call, and the sound was quite good at my end. At the other end, the sound quality was good enough for a hard of hearing elderly person to carry on a conversation better than when we use my land line.Regarding ANC ‚Äì I agree with some other reviewers that while the dial on the left earpiece is handy for immediate control of ANC vs transparency, it would be nice to have a physical ‚Äústop‚Äù where it is obvious where the dial is minimized and where it is maximized. The dial spins freely so you have to judge based on your hearing to detect and set the desired amount of ANC. To be fair, they do offer audible tones instead of a physical stop, but you need to learn to ‚Äúdecode‚Äù the different tones. I found the ANC effective enough to minimize noise from construction next door through open windows, nearby washer/dryer noises, and even our land line ringing 3 feet away from where I‚Äôm seated was barely audible. Standing outside in my yard, a wood chipper being used 2 doors down was fairly noisy as one would expect. With the H95 on full ANC but without music playing, the wood chipper was about 80+% dampened, still somewhat audible. With music at low-moderate volume (~40-50%), the wood chipper was not apparent.Other Notes:- The dial on the right earpiece for volume is a brilliant feature in my opinion. Might be easier than APM's small knob. Incidentally, the small knob on the Apple Watch does control H95 volume when listening to Apple Music in an iPhone.- H95 has physical shut off switch, unlike APM, although the H95 has an ultra long battery life (38 hrs with ANC on and 50 hrs without ANC) making this less critical.- H95 has multipoint connection, allowing maintain connections to two Bluetooth sources, which means for example you can listen on one and make calls on the other- H95 has two corded options, both provided in the box: 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable (analog), and USB-C to USB-A (digital).- H95 has a real case, unlike APM. However, I feel it is useful mainly as a protective case at home, not practical for travel.- The Bang & Olufsen app is nice but not essential. I did not find the EQ options to be as useful as expected. I‚Äôve settled on ‚ÄúOptimal‚Äù and have not found a need to change it. The variable option didn‚Äôt seem helpful or practical. The battery level indicator is useful to a degree, but due to the very long battery life, it doesn‚Äôt come into play much. On my PC Bluetooth section, the battery level is also indicated. The volume level can be adjusted on the H95 with the dial on the right earcup so the app is not needed for this. The app is a little glitchy on the iPhone ‚Äì more than once even though it was paired (appears in Settings>Bluetooth and music plays through) the app sometimes paradoxically cannot detect the H95. I had to delete and reinstall the app more than once. There is no app for computers (just mobile devices) but sometimes the Bluetooth connection on my PC is glitchy with drop outs.SummaryWhile it is not fair to expect that Beoplay H95 would perform at the same level as corded audiophile headphones costing much more, I believe that B&O did right by most things that count to optimize fine sound quality. The only significant downside for me is the relatively lower volume level, requiring cranking up the volume >70%. Whatever this suggests about the amplifier design and relative lack of headroom, it is not a deal breaker in my mind. And even though the H95 is much more expensive than every other BT ANC headphone currently available, for me attaining this high level of sound quality was worthwhile. Of course, each person must make his/her own assessment and decision based on their sound goals and personal financial situation.
My LOVE for the H95's runs deep!!!  But!  The first week was very scary.  Let me explain.BUT FIRST, a painful warning!  BEWARE of counterfeits being sold on Amazon.  If the specified seller is not "Amazon", DO NOT buy them, they will be counterfeit!!  They will usually be on sell too, be VERY careful!  (More about my counterfeit nightmare at the bottom)Ok, enough of my hellscape PSA...So, you may be asking, why was the first week very scary?When I first got my (real) H95's (day one hour one), after all of the video and article reviews, I found myself anticipating a transformative experience in listening to music, as if I've never listened to music before, ever.  To my immediate dismay, far from the profound sonic awaking I was ready for, I found myself was depressingly underwhelmed by what I was hearing from the H95's.  I questioned if it was only hype which I'd bought into (at great expense).  I didn't know what to make of my predicament, who knows maybe I was missing something fundamental, an aural puzzle demanding to be solved.Don't get me wrong, these headphones sounded great, but it wasn't the transcendental experience I was anticipating from all the reviews (Some people said they almost cried!)You see, I have a pair of B&O Beoplay EQ's and words cannot describe how incredible those tiny wireless Bluetooth earbuds sound.  As fundamentally blown away by the Beoplay EQs as I was immediately, I expected at least 5x the auditory sensory savoryness from the H95's.I had to be missing something in what it takes to get the sonic experience proclaimed by others for these headphones.So... thus began a journey of settings and component comprehension, a trek of almost two weeks full of doubt, trial, and error, before the pieces beginning to take sine wave shape, ultimately providing results fundamentally worth the whole effort.Yes, dear reader, I did perform the cardinal sin of setting my standards higher than my ability to comprehend what I was getting into.  I wasn't only facing EQ optimization within the B&O app, oh no, my dragon of complexity included a mini dac for phones (which I had no experience with previously), unexplainable settings only an audiophile could love, and every combination of wires, cables, and wireless weirdness with sparsely piecemeal disparate documentation.But then...It happened...There was a final a-ha moment with the final revelation of the final untried combination of settings...... Charge mode off ...In my pitch-black room, with a very soft pillow, I laid in my bed, H95s wired into my Fiio BTR5 DAC, a 24bit 96kHz album loaded on Qobuz, and within the first 15 seconds I left my body and entered a dream-like soundscape; an experience I've never had and one more than I could have expected.There were soooooo many unknowable details about setup steps I had to cobble together from disparate online sources.  In the end, it ends up making a lot of sense.  Having gained what I've learned, I've since had the pleasure of knowing how to configure different levels of sonic quality with different types of inputs for the headphones, and I've learned how to appreciate a whole new resolution and range of fidelity in music.  I've learned to appreciate styles and genres of music I've never been able to enjoy before when in the presence of very high res/quality examples and the H95s properly set up.  There are entire swaths of music I have always disliked I suddenly find a way to get lost beautifully within, this is so massive when you think about it, at a human experience level.Can I give all the credit to the B&O H95s?  No, but the H95s are undeniably a perfect catalyst for anyone new to what is possible at the level of very very high-quality sonic experiences.The worst experience you are going to have with the H95s is for them to be connected to your phone via Bluetooth and listening to Spotify, YouTube, or <=320mbps MP3s.  But, even then, with a properly set in-app equalizer, your sonic experience will be at least a league above the vast majority of other headphones <=$850 USD.  The H95s provide fantastic separation of sounds, deep and rich bass, and extremely clean highs and mids.While the beginning of my journey with the H95s was tentative and concerning, I could not be happier that this is only the very beginning of an audiophilic adventure which I know deepens and enriches more from here.I know that the B&O H95s can at most be considered the lowest entry level for audiophilia in headphones, and some purists might disagree with a "not true audiophile" association, I believe they fit this role like no other, and no one choosing the H95s as a starting point will very quickly come to perceive a whole new world without dipping your toes in too deep with headphones at the next level where the price doubles and it starts getting real crazy.So, that's my story, I hope it helps.Who knows, maybe I'll create some content showing what I learned with all the stupid weird settings I had to figure out painfully.  What do you think?  Do you think this would be valuable to others?
These are pretty awesome.  I am a headphone nerd.  I currently enjoy the B&O H9i.  I settled on those headphones after testing around 8 other headphones comparable in price.  The H9i beat them all except for noise cancelling, which they do not do especially well.  I use the B&O app and run essentially a V-curve EQ, moving the ball all the way to the right in the app EQ.  This really shows off the highs and lows of the H9i and I personally love it.NOW - moving on the H95.  To get similar EQ, I move the EQ ball all the way to the right and slightly up.  Anyway, noise cancellation is greatly improved.  Not as good as the Sony 1000XM - which defy science - but much better than the H9i.  In case you are wondering, when I listen to my wife‚Äôs 1000XM3, I am always disappointed in the plentiful but inarticulate bass, lack of separation and other issues.  The 1000XM line is great if you are not a critical listener.  The noise cancelling is creepy its so good.  But the audio itself is nothing special.The H95 carries a little more volume than the H9i.  The lows are still punchy and articulate, and the highs are true and clear.  The mids are perfect.  However this is the case for the H9i, but the H95 is a little better overall.But what strikes me more than anything is instrument separation.  I‚Äôve never heard it done so well anywhere and they are much better than the H9i in this regard.  Such a treat to listen to.Yes the build and case are first class.  Expected at this price. However I wish the case did not say ‚Äústeal me!!!‚ÄùNOW THE BAD NEWS.  I knocked off 1 star due to the following issue.  With my EQ settings, the songs Dire Straits "Your Latest Trick‚Äù (1:07) and Pink Floyd ‚ÄúMother‚Äù were an issue.  These are ‚Äútest songs‚Äù for me.  The H95 has light popping and cracking in parts of these songs.  Every other song I listened to sounded superb.  But not these 2, and I will probably run across a few  others.  Ironically, the H9i does not struggle in the least with these songs. VERY disappointing.  The good news is that the other 30 songs I tested went superbly.
I was very excited to use these as i've owned my Bose QC2 since 2019 and it was time for an upgrade. These headphones were the top of my list because... well.. B&O, who can resist this brand and it's quality? I mustered up about a grand for these beauties, but the excitement was short lived. I work from home and am constantly walking around from my bedroom office to kitchen, bathroom, etc. any time i would be further than 10 feet from my computer, the headphones would start distorting. i can overlook this, no big deal. my biggest hurdle was sound when i was simply walking with my phone on me, in a meeting. the sound would just disappear for several seconds at a time. i couldn't justify paying so much money for headphones that would drop connection like that as i've owned airpods, bose headphones and have never experienced it. i did research, tried to update firmware, etc., but nothing helped.sound is 11/10physical quality is 10/10connection is 7/10
From everything I've listened to these have the best sound quality of any wireless headphone - easily.  Makes my Sony XM4 headphones seem dark and noticeably lacking detail.  Previously Sony XM4s were at the top of most people's list for wireless cans.  Comfort-wise, the Sony's win (light weight and plus ear pads) but the B&O H95 are more luxurious and have a tighter seal.  ANC is similar - both top rate.Compared to my collection of wired headphones, the B&O H95 falls just below my lower tier audiophile headphones:  Sennheiser HD600 and HD650, HiFiMan Deva and Sony MDR-Z7M2.  And noticeably below my top-tier headphones Sony MDRZ1R, beyerdynamic T1 2nd Gen, HiFiMan HE6se and AKG K812 Pro.  I never expected this B&O H95 to challenge my best, but I wanted to see how close they would come.  Bluetooth just can't compete in a wired segment yet.The B&O H95 is very, very clear, has lots of detail, strong tight bass and textured highs.  I would consider it a mild to moderate V-shape which appears more pronounced because of the remarkable clarity they produce.  Sound stage is very good compared to my wired cans but the best I've heard in the Bluetooth arena.For portable listening I still prefer my wired in-ears: Sennheiser IE800 v2 and Westone W80 v2 and W60 v2.  Even with the larger drivers in the B&O H95, the clarity and quality of the Westone is better.  I actually consider my Westone W80 just a hair below my AKG K812 Pro and Sony MDR-Z1R (which are considered some of the best open and closed cans available right now).
I bought the Beoplay H95 for listening to music so that's what I will write about. I agree with many others that these sound better than most other wireless headsets currently available. There is always personal preference, but this set has solid performance that's hard to surpass. The sound is well rounded with sufficient depth and clarity and an appealing stage. Most people are particular about bass, and what this set delivers will appeal to accurate bass enthusiasts more than to those looking for bass boost. That said, there is plenty of bass for everyone.The app has an option to change the sound profile which made a pleasant difference to me as I like my sound more on the "bright" side. Likewise you can use this setting to make them sound as "warm" as your standard plastic phones. The H95 also support aptX which is an enhanced Bluetooth codec that made some difference on my Android phone.The noise cancellation on the H95 is not it's primary strength and not as good as on my Bose QC 35, but then again the sound is remarkably better. There seems to be some buzzing at whichever level you set it to, but it doesn't affect the listening experience. On the other hand, the transparency mode is a very useful feature, although these days fairly standard on noise cancelling phones. The controls make sense, less physical buttons and two integrated dials that are easy to operate.The H95 can be used as a wired headset, but to my surprise I didn't find a difference in sound quality between wireless and wired mode. Not sure what that says about either one. I did notice the low volume others have described, but it is definitely high enough for harm free listening and maybe that's what the makers intended. In any way, there is plenty of detail to make up for sheer volume. Battery life is so generous that I yet have to charge the set for the first time.In my opinion the H95 is a product with a purpose and the premium materials definitely help to set it apart. I would recommend it to anyone looking for cultivated listening, but the lingering question is whether it delivers what you expect for the price. At the end of the day, this set is in a class of its own.
Comfort, looks, sound, ease of use, and any other factor that matters, you cannot do any better!This head set is just over the top classy, solidly the best.  Bang and Olufsen outdid themselves.  I have checked out the rest and can comfortably attest, that these are the very best headphones ever made.  Hands down.
Every audio company puts a priority on what matters to them the most in order to save cost. The B&O design and materials spared no expense, but the volume and clarity at high levels took a hit. I agree with other reviewers, the sound is very low and I had to listen at 70 percent to hit the music at enjoyable levels, however the vocals and other Mids took a hit.On the other hand, the XM5s look cheap and no where near pleasing to the eyes. However, they sound phenomenal over the H95s. If you want to flex on audiophiles or those in elites of society then they are for you. If you care about sound more, than I say get the XM5s.
2022-04-18 MonI am:  Broadcaster  Musician  Acoustic Engineer  Loudspeaker Engineer  Recording EngineerHeadphone requires >2h burn in.  Before that headphone is terribly muddy....After two weeks:PROS+  Good isolation+  Good noise cancelling+  Great articulation relative to BlueTooth headphones, especially with bass, after some rolloff.+  Comfortable for >10h.+  5 Year Warranty+  Good BluetoothCONS‚Äì Not terrifically LOUD, barely sufficient in some cases.‚Äì Does not clamp head sufficiently for anything strenuous outdoors.‚Äì Bass Heavy, absolutely atrocious on this set. Complete tonal failure.  If you want accuracy, go to NeuMann NH20.  You are not going to find honesty with B&O.  BeyerDynamic Lagoon are a better alternative than B&O.RECOMMENDATION  Based on this review copy, these headphones are not worth the money at all with their gross deficiencies.  If you can stand to do the heavy EQ necessary, and love the two dial rings for volume & noise canceling, and money is not important, then ok. Otherwise, this headset is a royal pain.
Noise cancellation, awesome sound quality! Also great battery life as well. Happy I made the choice of bang Olufsen H95!!!!! Ooh La La!!!

As someone who likes to write music on my free time, I bought these headphones to help me improve my mixing decisions. I also wanted something relatively durable since I‚Äôm tired of replacing my $30-40 headphones every year. As a college student, these 569s were an investment for me.COMFORT:The HD 569 is my first pair of cans over $40.  And it‚Äôs the first pair that I can honestly say is comfortable for long listening and mixing sessions. Ear cups encapsulate my ears, and the padding provides a nice cushion and passive noise isolation.NOISE-ISOLATIONI go to a military college and it‚Äôs common to hear yelling in the hallways. These headphones actually block out a lot of that noise, making it easier to study. I can still hear what‚Äôs going on outside my room, but it‚Äôs not distracting. Note that the noise-isolation is passive, not active.SOUND QUALITYSound quality is great as far as I can tell. It seems very mid-centric but that‚Äôs fine by me. It just took a little getting used to as my brain adjusted to this new normal. However, I wish the highs were emphasized a bit more so I could get a better sense of what‚Äôs going on up there. However, it‚Äôs also true that recessed highs means less listening fatigue. In other words, these headphones can work fine for mixing, while also being great for casual listeners who just want to enjoy music or watch movies. Soundstage is good too.DURABILITYIt looks and feels like it will last for at least several years. But take everything I say here with a very small grain of low-sodium salt, because my experience with headphones is limited compared to the many audio professionals here.I appreciate that it doesn‚Äôt use a hinge-style mechanism to clamp the earcups because in my experience those can wear out or break easily. The build quality of this 569 seems better than the MD-7506s I‚Äôve used at a studio. Bear in mind these are just my first-impressions. Regrettably, I missed the time-traveling lesson my friends said I missed in elementary school. So unfortunately, I cannot at this moment tell you how these headphones will hold up in the next few years. But don‚Äôt worry - if I remember, I‚Äôll post a 4 month update when I finish my fall semester.DUST PROBLEMThis is not a huge problem, but I feel it is worth mentioning.The smaller black circle on the outer face of each earcup easily attracts dust. The padding material on the earcups and headband also suffer from this. It‚Äôs frustrating because now I have to pick out/wipe off the dust every few days, especially from the outside. Again, it‚Äôs not really that bad if it‚Äôs just one or two day‚Äôs worth of dust (only takes a minute or so getting it out), but if I let the dust settle for even a week, I imagine it would be a nightmare getting it all out. I dust all horizontal surfaces in my dorm room every day out of habit, so it feels unnatural for me to leave something with dust on it.This is purely aesthetic; it has zero effect on comfort or sound quality.CONCLUSIONSo far so good. I recommend these HD 569s to anyone looking for a pair of headphones that is comfortable, durable, and has sound quality that is good for both mixing and casual listening.
The Sennheiser 569 are comfortable, neutral, well-balanced, and naturally isolating for long-term listening. These are ideal if you are studying, working, or concentrating for hours at a time and you don‚Äôt want to be distributed or disturb others. They will not jump out or kick your eardrums, nor do they have extreme highs or lows. They have a very neutral, cozy, warm sound.They would also be suitable for anyone who doesn‚Äôt want the sound to bleed when watching movies, listening to movies, or playing video games. Most likely, the person sitting next to you will not hear them. So also a reasonable consideration for traveling.The earcups are likely the most comfortable you will ever feel on your head. They disappear and never fit too loose or snug, but that‚Äôs my personal experience.The soundstage is frontal and well-imaged. They are not claustrophobic or overly separated like many other headphone brands and models I‚Äôve tried.They work fine powered by a phone, laptop, or tablet but will sound fuller with increased depth when amplified. I use the 569s with a NAD - D 3020 V2 combined with an Airport Express 2nd Generation (for Apple Music at cd-quality), and they sound fantastic for long hours of listening while working.
En general muy buen audifono por el precio, muy conforme.Luego de unas semanas, estas son mis impresiones. La comodidad es muy buena, las almohadillas son suaves y muy moldeables, pero al ser de un relleno tan suave pierden ese sello para evitar que el sonido escape con el movimiento de la cabeza, se siente como flojo el aud√≠fono. En cuando al sonido, muy claro, cristalino y con mucho detalle, con la suficiente cantidad de bajo y agudo, pero con un √©nfasis especial en los medios. Debido a que son aud√≠fonos cerrados y con ese resalte en medios a veces el sonido se escucha como encajado, embotellado, no se como explicarlo, pero no del todo natural. El espacio en el sonido es bastante amplio a los lados, pero no profundo, y eso hace que en ciertas canciones los instrumentos se sientan apretados y amontonados, la separaci√≥n instrumental no es su fuerte. El cable con microfono es muy funcional, he contestado llamadas y me escuchan sin problemas, asi que un plus en ese sentido, y esto los hace unos todo terreno, escuchar musica, ver peliculas, videojuegos, tambien los veo como buena opci√≥n para estudio.Est√°n muy bien construidos aunque totalmente hechos en pl√°stico, pero no se siente barato ni hacen ruidos al manipularlos, con piezas f√°cilmente reemplazables, lo que ayuda para que te duren muchos a√±os de uso.En resumen de nuevo, unos aud√≠fonos muy vers√°tiles, con buena calidad de sonido, que creo te duraran muchos a√±os, y que son tal vez la mejor compra en este rango de los 100 dolares.
I'm comparing these to my Sennheiser HD600 headphones.Being closed back they do a pretty good job at muffling noise, even without active noise cancellation.The sound is not bad and would be fine for most people (including me).You will need to purchase a longer 3.5mm cable or a 6.3mm to 3.5mm adapter. The included 1.2m 3.5mm cable is way too short for anything, except maybe a phone in your pocket.The way the head piece attaches to the ear cups is weird. When putting the headphones on and taking them off the asymmetrical attachment is strange and makes me thing I'm going to drop them or something is broken. While wearing them I do not notice this and they are comfortable, though not as much as my HD600. Mostly, I think, due to the extra weight.The cable coming from the left ear cup is also (to me) weird. All the headphones I've owned have had the cable either come out of both or just the right ear cup.The price of $110 isn't bad.
The price was fair, and I like the closed back along with good reports on its sound signature much like the more expensive Sennheiser's. They have decent sound isolation and need very little power to drive them. They are well-made and light. They sound good on just about any mobile audio device. And they really sound great on A&K cube.
For the price these are impressive!  The sleek design is light yet sturdy, the ear pads are very comfortable, and the sound is quite acceptable to very good.  They have a nice midrange with decent bass, I fine tune all my headphones with a preamp and these zero in nicely.  I‚Äôve been using a set of Beyerdynamic DT 770s for a while and after they were stolen I bought a new set to replace them.  The quality of the DT 770s has declined since I purchased the 1st set and I was no longer happy with them.  Going with the Sennheiser HD 560s as a lateral move I was very pleased.  The sound is nicer, they are easier to drive, and they are just as comfortable as the Beyerdynamics and fit nicer on my head.The only draw back is the cord, it seems like  headphone manufacturers are skimping on the cords these days to cut cost or something.  The cord with the HD 569s is too wobbly and has somewhat of a tacky feel and it tangles easily, other than that, these would have been 5 star headphones.These are very well designed, and In the $100.00 to $150.00 price range, I haven‚Äôt come across anything nicer.  This is the first purchase I‚Äôve made from Amazon in quite a while that seem to be worth what I payed for it (not their usual Asian junk, although made in China).Recommend!  Worth ordering just to try them out even if they are returned.
I bought these to start a podcast. My usual headphones are Bose 700s. But I needed wired phones.Sennheiser always makes splendid products. These are excellent.I could not hope for better sound. I love these. And they are the most comfortable headphones I've ever had. Note, these are studio phones so no mic. Highly recommended.
I've seen a few complaints about these cans here concerning headband and ear cushion wear issues. I cannot comment on that yet, but I have to say that these are the best headphones I've ever worn and I've been around for 65 years.Comfort A+These are closed-back and other than the closed in sensation, which is to be expected, they are a dream so far. That's saying something because I have a huge melon and I haven't even stretched them out yet! I own the HD 58x Jubilees and they took some time to break in and it took some "gorillaing" to stretch them out to help that. These felt great out of the box.Weight - what weight?Sound:Keep in mind that I'm coming at this from an audiophile perspective. I won't grade them on a scale because everyone is looking for something different. These are no dubstep or hip-hop phones unless you are mixing with them. These are more like real professional monitors than entertainment cans. They could use maybe 3dB more bass, but I'd rather have a little less than too much. Compared to the Jubilees, they are a little thin, but I feel that the 58x's can be a bit too much and the bass seems to overload (distort) too soon. The mids are perfect and vocals are clean and accurate. I can't speak for the highs because I'm old and lost the highs long ago. I do wear hearing aids and they seem fine, but I don't even remember what natural high frequencies sound like. These artificial (Oticon) highs do sound great thru these though. I'll leave it at that. Put it this way: I currently have a pair of Buchardt s300s (traded in KEF LS50s.) and these are a lot closer to what those sound like than anything else I've heard. All cans seem bass-heavy to me lately (other than Apple Airpods and some on-ear sets - honorable mention to the Cooler Master 751, which I game with). These are a relief from the usual mud.Gaming:No mic, but if you just want to hear them coming, these are great. Sharp with detail and no artificial boom or slop. If you are familiar with the Cooler Master 751, these are balanced like those, but have much better detail and similar comfort. If you crave bass, I'd recommend the Jubilees. They have that and more. They will need breaking in on the comfort end though.Efficiency:Easy to drive! On an iPhone, I'm about about 35% through the Apple DAC dongle. You don't have to waste money on an amp. I would recommend a good DAC on a PC though. A Dragonfly Black would suffice. It sure beats an onboard chip.In short, I wouldn't recommend these for someone buying their first set. They are for the "mature" listener. If you want something that can use a small bass boost to get you there, these are great. If you hate boosted bass, these are perfect. You won't have to change a thing.
I am using this with Tidal music service to listen to the master quality audio, bought a THX Onyx with it , have an apple phone had to buy a camera to lighting port dongle which it suggests.  So far so good I haven‚Äôt had the time to listen to everything.  What I have listened to is on par with the price.  Of course there are better ones out there but 400.00 is too much for me.  I prefer the noise canceling without hearing outside noises.  The comfort is good.  I really want to hear on a recording something I haven‚Äôt heard normally the little things that I never have heard before on a favorite song,  that what gets me excited.
The price is right, the sound is great. I can wear them for a long period without discomfort. They work with everything I‚Äôve plugged them into, even my iPhone, excellently.I‚Äôd definitely buy them again.
https://www.amazon.com/Skullcandy-Crusher-Wireless-Over-Ear-Headphones/product-reviews/B01DWH77GC/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews
The Skull Candy Crusher Wireless is a great set of cans for multiple uses. Let me say, first, we have bought 3 pairs of these in less than a year. First pair was for our 15 yo son, second pair was for my husband, and the third pair I finally bought for myself (early Xmas gift). The fact we have 3 pairs of these should say it all! All 3 pairs we bought are in black. Too many reviews had the white pair breaking, so with this last purchase, I felt there were not enough reviews with enough time on them for the new colors to make me feel confident they, too, would not break in the same spot as the white ones. So, black it was. One can never go wrong with black in headphones!The first pair was bought in early May, for a 15 yo who is not always super careful with his stuff. They've been dropped, and used every single day by him and are still working perfectly, still charge just as fast and the battery still lasts forever. They have held up to his clumsiness and look as if we bought them yesterday, though they've been dropped and dinged here and there. My husband got his the 3rd week in May and he uses his constantly. He works from home and is on the phone a LOT. Conference calls, broadcasts (radio/YouTube for interviews), and phone calls/video calls with friends both here in the States and globally. As for my husband's use - they DO work with Skype on a cell - we have Note 9s, and they DO work with Skype via the computer (for reference, he has an Asus Rog). He had to go into Skype and tell it to recognize these particular cans. They didn't work at first, but he did finally get them to. They work on all of our other call apps, WhatsApp, Wire, Signal, VSee Etc. They work with our regular phone calls beautifully too. They also connect to our Bluetooth unit we have hooked into our TV. They both connect even though we have the same headphones. We had some trouble getting 2 identical headphones connecting at first. One would automatically pick up, then we had to activate pairing mode on the headphones then press our bluetooth button on the tv unit and then it found them. Took a day to figure it out, but we did it lol! They work AWESOME with that! If you turn the bass all the way up or 3/4 of the way up, I swear, it seriously feels like you are sitting in a movie theater. The sound quality is awesome for watching tv. Often, one of us will fall asleep and to avoid waking the other, tv gets muted and headphones go on. Now, we use them even when we are both awake because they make for a great experience with the upgraded sound for the tv! Our son just keeps them connected to his phone or he uses the auxiliary cord and plugs them into his switch when he plays it. Sure beats ear buds. Plus, our son says earbuds are super uncomfortable for him and refuses to use them, so that's why we initially bought these for him.The battery life is CRAZY GOOD! This is one of the reasons we went with these 3 times. They charge up from fully drained fairly quick (a few hours) and the battery lasts FOREVER. This battery, by far, is the best out there. Nothing else to say - battery life is AMAZING.Side note - they sound even better when you go in to your cell and tweak the audio settings to your liking. On our Notes, we both had to download a good EQ/audio app and we tweaked from there. He did the same thing on his laptop, and again, amazing sound. Hes a bit of an audiophile, and while no - these aren't the top cans for an audiophile, but he is very impressed with the sound (music/tv) for the price. He actually loves these and prefers these cans for calls, watching TV, and listening to music over his top dollar Sony Noise Cancelling headphones and over his even higher priced Sennheisers. He got these because he needed a good pair with a good mic and sound for calls (as people were complaining over hearing him with the Sonys), and true cans for audiophiles, well, you can't really use them for phone calls lol. He has an expensive pair of Sennheiser cans, and once tweaked, honestly, these sounded better to me than the $400 ones. But - my ears are super sensitive to treble and it hurts my ears. So the highs not being very pronounced with these is perfect for me. The mids are definitely recognizable and neither of us have any issue with sound nor do we miss anything. When watching tv you pick up on all of the little background things you never notice. With music, you can actually hear the singer take the smallest of breaths where you couldn't before. Again, ours are tweaked for our phones and computers, BUT they are NOT tweaked for our tv, it's impossible there and we still catch every little thing.So far, the hinges are holding up. Before we purchased these for our son, we actually went to Best Buy and looked at all of the models and different brands. Skull Candy, overall, were the best for the money and comfort out of all their in-store models. When we compared these to the Venues, we went with these because they feel far more substantial than the Venues. These are heavier and feel/seem to be made sturdier than the Venues. It seems to me the only differences in the two models are - ear pieces twist out on the Venue not on the Crusher, Venue has noise cancelling and Crushers do not, Crusher has the added bass adjustment & Venues don't, and finally, the Crusher seems far strudier/a bit heavier/better made than the Venues and are cheaper than the Venues.I dont think these would be ideal for jogging or running...but I dont run anymore unless it's for my life - so, I dont run. Lol. If you put them on and tap the outside of the can, you can hear it "reverberating". And I've seen other reviews about hearing that while running due to the jolt of the "bouncing" of the body while jogging. That would irritate me. They are a little heavy, but you get used to that quickly and they are super comfy so the weight never was a bother to to me nor my husband or son. We all wear glasses/contacts. They do not hurt my ears where my earpieces are. The cups are super cushy and they only get softer/better over time. Keep in mind, these are NOT noise cancelling. But, my husband often listens to loud music 2 feet away from me and I can't say I can readily identify what he's listening to unless I got closer, so again, it's not a noticeable issue for me. When our toddler comes and crawls into bed with us, if we are watching tv, we have them on pretty loud, and it doesn't bother her a bit, even when she's got her head on my arm. Noises bother her if she's trying to go to sleep. She would, very loudly, have said something by now if she heard any sound from the headphones, or heard it loud enough. She has not.I have paid 3 different prices for these each time I purchased them. 120 for our son, 108 for hubs, and I picked them up on Cyber Monday for 79.99. Even at 120, I would buy them again and would've happily paid it for the 2nd and 3rd pairs. They are holding up really well, have great sound, and fold up for smaller storage. They come with a nice little bag that holds them, but if you want any kind of real protection so you can throw them in a bag and go, I would invest in a hard shell case for them. The bag won't protect them other than keeping them put away when not in use at home. The charge cord is good and seems to be good quality and the aux cord it comes with is really nice! The part under the jack is like a box and causes less stress on the jack and plug so it wont short out as easy. I really love the design of the auxillary cord.If you aren't too terribly rough on headphones and plan on using these for a range of things - like calls, music, & hooking into the tv - these are DEFINITELY the cans for you! They are WELL worth their price, whatever that may be. I would just invest in a hard shell case and take care of them. Most of the breakage issues I saw in reviews were with the white ones. Other colors, in my opinion, dont have enough reviews with enough time in use to be confident that they wont do the same thing the white ones seems to do. We have had zero issues with our 3 sets in black, with one son who isnt always as careful as he should be with the more expensive stuff he wants lol, and they've held up to him perfectly. These are definitely worth your hard earned money! Skull Candy did good with these!!! I would give them my money again if I needed a 4th pair for any reason. Just go on and buy them!!!!
OH MAN ARE THESE THINGS AWESOME! Putting on some El Alfa, bad bunny, Ryan Castro, and anything else with a cool beat! I love the bass slider on the headset, you will feel the base when you kick that on. You can adjust it for how much or how little you want, really adds pop to the sound! You ever hear a Honda driving past you with its music on blast? That‚Äôs what these speakers sound and feel like with base all the way up! It‚Äôs amazing! Even with the base off, the sound is great, battery lasts forever, it‚Äôs a tight fit so your headset isn‚Äôt going no where. If you have the set on, others won‚Äôt hear the music your listening too, base on or off. Love the color I got (I went with green) and couldn‚Äôt be happier with em! Highly recommend them for sure!
UPDATE (7/23/18):  I've had these for about 3-4 days.  I wrote a glowing review based on my first day of use.  Although,  I'm afraid after a few hours of use I have to say these aren't worth the money and not something I would use or could use.  Here are a list of things I realized and found out after using them.1.  They literally crush your head.  They are very tight.  My son who is 15 has a pair and I have a pair.  Both of us complained of getting headaches and almost nauseous due to how tight they are on your head.  I've heard of some saying that they loosen up over a period of use, but I'm not going to wait it out.  They. are. tight.2.  NO MID RANGE.  High's are highs and lows are lows... but no mid.  I tested the headphones with my PS4 playing Ghost Recon Wildlands and Far Cry 5 and the guns sound flat.  Yes, the bass is punching you in the head but that's about all you hear and feel.  I thought maybe I was crazy so I pulled out my Cloud 2's and switched back and forth for about 30 minutes.  I shot guns, threw grenades, tested the scope of sound (hearing ambient effects around you) and honestly, the Cloud 2's in my opinion kill these.  The Cloud 2's don't have the thunderous bass that the Crushers do but they have a awesome mid range where you can feel and hear the gun shot, grenade explosions, etc.  This only was one of the major reason's I couldn't keep the Crushers.  I cannot recommend these for gaming.  Especially for long sessions.3.  I can't pair them with my TV, PS4, XBOX One.  Yes I hear you can get a dongle to assist in pairing the Crushers but I don't want to go that route.  I did use the wire that comes with the Crushers but there's a difference in sound between wired and bluetooth.4.  Music sounds great .... For awhile.  I missed that mid-range and true bass.  These do not have true bass.  The bass is like listening to someone having a party behind a cement wall.  There's just something off about it.  You can only handle so much.5.  HERE's the one where I can honestly say the Crushers kick butt.  Pairing these with your iPad or iPhone and watching a action flick on Netflix.  Tested it with Star Wars and the explosions and dialogue sounded great.  Although, I did plug them into my PS4 controller via the wire that comes with it and tried watching Netflix and there seemed to be a loss in quality of sound.  Switched back to bluetooth through my iPad and boom sound was thunderous and movies haven't sounded better.  Like sitting in a IMAX theater.6.  All in all, we returned the Crushers.  For the money, I'd rather save some more cash and get some Astros with an AMP or use my Cloud 2's and hook them up through a small receiver which is also connected to my PS4 and turn those bad boys up and get all the bass I need but with Mid's and Highs.I just can't recommend these.  I think the reviews are like myself... blown away the first few hours but then reality sinks in and you kind of realize what your dealing with.  It's sort of a gimmick and you can get better headphones with a less bass and still be quite happy.Original Review:I did a week's worth of research looking all over the internet for anyone really going into detail on whether the Crushers were a good gaming headset.  Well, now that I have them, I can safely say...  OH YEAH!  So here's a quick backstory...  I have been on the search for a pair of headphones that would allow me to feel the explosions, feel the bones crunching.  I have tried the Playstation Golds, Clouds, Astros, Sans, Sonys and none of them really had a deep pounding bass.  Don't get me wrong, all of them are great headphones.  I specifically bought the Cloud II's because to me for the price they had the best balance of sound and bass.  Saying that,  my son came running out of Best Buy and told me I had to try the Crushers.  Honestly, I laughed at him.  NO way.  I'll never buy Skull Candy or Beats.  Not for gaming.  I went anyway and holy crap did they rattle your head.  BUT, I still questioned whether they would produce good mid's and high's and would the bass actually sound good while gaming on my PS4.  So, my son ordered a pair on Amazon and they showed up today (7/19).  We plugged them into the PS4 and fired up Mad Max which has some awesome explosions and the cars rumble hard....  OH Man was it like nothing I've heard in a headphone.  The shotgun was deep and powerful.... The cars rumbled.  I mean rumbled.  Not a distorted bass but clean deep overpowering rumble.  Just awesome.So, after trying them and testing them...  A few things popped out...1.  The bass is truly something else.  Powerful.  I actually turned it all the way down to around 10% and it was just as good.  So imagine at 10% what it would feel like at 75%... It's nuts.2.  The PS4 has always had a issue with not really allowing headphones to really go 'LOUD'.  It's like it limits the volume to a certain extent and then stops.  You can't go louder.  Same scenario with the crushers.  I was loud but not as loud as I would like it.  I compared them to our cloud II's and same situation.  We are aware they are bluetooth but still trying to figure out how to connect them to the PS4.  I'm sure that would fix the volume issue.  So because of this... the mid's and high's weren't incredibly loud but completely doable.3.  Sound bleed was honestly very quiet.  My son had them cranked and I could not hear them.  Not bad.  So my wife won't get irritated while watching a movie on my iPad right next to her.4.  THINK IMAX SOUND in your ears while watching an action movie.  No joke, explosions and someone getting a kick in the face is felt.  John Wick and Equalizer is awesome with the crushers.Bottom line.  Well made, great sound, amazing bass like nothing I've heard.  For movies and games, no brainer in my book.  For music, even better.  BUT, keep in mind, it's not a true bass so for bass heads... these are awesome but for music purists...  I'd try something else.Gaming with these is just awesome.  Experience it.
These headphones are insane!! the sound quality is amazing and not too mention the bass is something I would of never expected from a pair headphones. I was a little skeptical buying these because I was not too satisfied with my pair of Skullcandy Hesh 2 Wireless I previously owned, but these are so much better than them. Another thing too add is that I owned a pair of Beats Solo 3‚Äôs and wasn‚Äôt too satisfied either, but of all the over-ear headphones i‚Äôve owned these Crusher‚Äôs are the best!
Whenever I got these almost 2 years ago, I was lucky enough to catch a deal at 150 dollars down from the original 199.Fast forward to now, I was curious to see what black friday deals were going for these. 99 dollars is a steal just for the sound quality and battery life alone. I'm going on 2 years of fairly heavy use (I have these on all the time in my house except sleeping) and I often use them as a hairband doing stuff around the house if we're being honest. The range is exceptional. I had very low expectations whenever it came to the range, but after investing in one of the higher grade usb dongles (only 12 bucks or so) I can get signal through 3-4 walls 40 feet away consistently. Other bluetooth devices I had issues going through a single wall and resyncing properly.That being said, while these look rugged they will develop hairline cracks around the housing that holds the cans even if you baby them. It's fully plastic from the cans to the steel band in the headband. While I was first irritated with the build quality, I began to learn just how to combat this common issue and currently feel much better with everything from the fit to the durability of them since. You will learn very quickly upon learning of an issue with a skullcandy product that the warranty has a lot of loopholes............so anything other than a complete technical failure of a feature is not covered whatsoever. Moreso, I believe there's even shipping that a customer would have to pay for pending a replacement or fix of an above mentioned technical failure.I tried superglue, I wasn't concerned with the cosmetic look, it didn't work. I tried using sparingly amounts of jbweld (5 dollars for 2x1oz tubes of steel reinforced epoxy) that would work temporarily until eventually I had a complete separation as seen in many of those pictures on this page. That's when I just unapologetically gooped the jbweld all over the joint. It worked so well that a week later I intentional broke the other side (that I was having to baby for fear of breakage) just to goop it up with jbweld. Going for a rough break I was able to completely fuse all of those problem parts that tend to break, and I wish I would have done it sooner. It took time and a lot of nerves to get through, but it was well worth it.I ended up completely caking the joint and letting it cure carefully (because it's pretty rigid after using it) two different times on each side to ensure it was able to fully cure and have enough support to keep the joint straight. It's been 6 months or so since I "fixed" them and I'm not worried in the least about them breaking again.Another issue that could be unique to my headphones but I wanted to mention is the haptic bass switch. I've seen other reports of the switch being loose feeling and finicky. I've had the same issue from early on with my pair. I believe it's fairly common and remedied with patience, but I try my best to keep the switch from fully engaged or fully disengaged as there seems to be some disconnect of the wires if you're not careful. Also, it's worth mentioning to use the enhancements and "bass boost" in options if you feel like you can't find a good balance of haptic bass using the switch. Personally I have it set to boost 80hz and below by 3 db, and that lets the switch cover all the bases (puns).I'm glad I have these crushers rather than the hesh 2 bluetooth design for sound quality and comfort, but if you wanted to have something to use in the gym and toss in a bag or to keep in your car without worrying about breaking them, I would definitely go with the hesh 2 variety. The bluetooth hadn't come out yet whenever I got my hesh 2s but I've had them for 4 years and they're still a functional semi-comfortable wired headphones with decent sound. If you're on the go I wouldn't want to have the crushers on anyways because they do block so much ambient sound.In closing, if I felt like my current pair wouldn't stand the test of time I'd buy 2 at this price today just for the love of the sound quality, ear comfort, passive noise canceling, and powerful-and-versatile haptic bass. If you're a fan of chillstep, futurebass, or trance music these are a godsend. Other than the general build quality the only other thing I could see skullcandy on doing to improve these headphones is selling an accessory that turned the headset into a pillow you could sleep in, they're that comfortable.Instead of some "insurance plan" that you'll never qualify for or want to mess with, I'd instead buy some jbweld that matches the finish you buy and remember to check for cracks before they get out of hand or hard to manage everytime you plug in to charge them. The battery lasts for a LONG time so that's only like once every 2-4 weeks.
I listen to music while I work and tho these aren‚Äôt noise canceling they drown out the majority of background noise. Overall battery life is huge and they fit my big cranium with ease. I normally wear a 7 5/8 fitted hat so yeah they fit nice with all that considered. I like the adjustable bass on the left‚Ä¶  and I can pause/play and adjust volume with ease on the right side. Overall a great purchase!
These headphones have hands down the best most powerful sound it‚Äôs even possible to get. The loudness, the bass is waaay better than any product I‚Äôve ever used. Period. I won‚Äôt listen to anything else‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.buuutttt, the build quality is pure crap. After About 5 months of use, the padding is falling off (I keep them in their case when not in use). Additionally, if you walk more than 10 feet away from your phone, they skip terribly; the Bluetooth is garbage, plain and simple.The battery lasts forever tho.
It's hard not to bust a move when you listen to your bass heavy jams with these. No need to slide the bass button to max, half way is good to prevent deafness. When watching movies, I wish there was a little more bass in people's voice when they speak, but still these sound pretty good for music and movies.
I bought these headphones mainly to exercise in, they have great sound and bass. the noise cancellation isn't perfect but it is plenty. They are affordable and amazing for their price point. The battery lasts a long time, as I can go weeks without charging them. a great product and would highly recommend.
The bass in the middle of the slide bar is super bassy, the vibrations sent chills down my spine when I first used it. The quality is super nice and it doesn't feel cheap either. I've been wanting these for a while and I got more than I expected. The only small thing is the tops aren't accentuated enough. They can feel a little dull sometimes but then again the Bass is just amazing. If you listen to a lot of dubstep/ phonk / bass boosted music these are for you!

So the first set of headphones I bought lasted about 3.3 years. During COVID, the headset that used to be for casual gaming time with friends became a daily meeting work tool.I abused these headphones by stuffing it into backpacks since they‚Äôre made pretty durable and over time the ear paddings was slowly showing wear. However, the headphone was still useable. What eventually broke was the wiring that caused sound to not go into one of the ears.The over-ear padding does put some pressure on the ears which takes time to get used to.The noise canceling is pretty good. I have a portable air conditioner that gets pretty loud and most people I asked if they could hear it going, didn‚Äôt even know I had one on.The sound quality is okay. I‚Äôm not an audiophile but I‚Äôm sure my friends who are (and has paid hundreds for a better sounding pair) would say the headphone is okay for a cheapo pair.The headphones work fine on my old iPhone/iPad that has a AUX jack. It works on both MacBooks and PCs. Works fine on a backbone controller for newer iPhones. I‚Äôve even tried it on a Roku remote (needs an AUX jack) to stream shows.There are no blinking LED lights and you can mute yourself by flipping the mic up and down, no switch needed. One quirk to the mic is you might need to make sure the mic is on first when going into a meeting room but afterwards, just flip the mic up to mute yourself. It‚Äôs definitely convenient without having to manually mute yourself. I also work with a lot of different meeting apps so not all of them are have a proper mute hotkey.One visible difference from the first pair to the new one is the microphone. The older pair‚Äôs mic curves and is a bit more bendable that when you flip it up, it nicely slopes along the side and top of the headset. When you flip the new pair up, it just stands straight up like a weird antenna and is no longer as bendable. Not quite sure the reasoning for it. It does feel odd having it stick up like that when not in use though.Overall, there isn‚Äôt much to really complain about. I‚Äôm definitely much happier with the new pair than I would with other headphones out there, and I have tried a few others after the first pair broke.
This is exclusively a PC review, so keep that in mind. Your mileage may vary depending on your console. That said, most of this will hold true regardless of platform.This is the first Hyper X product I've owned, and I've got to say I'm very impressed. Even at this price point, the sound quality beats out much more expensive Logitech headsets I've bought in the past.These aren't ANC headphones, so there will be some audio bleed from the outside world, though at higher volumes this issue rapidly dissipates. Bass is on the heavier side, as it is with most gaming headsets, while mids and highs are well represented and not over saturated.I don't use the mic much for anything (online gaming tends to be pretty toxic) but in the minor tests I've done with it, it sounds OK; it's not good, but it's not bad. I did however have an issue where the mic was extremely quiet, even at 30+db boost. I suspect this a Windows issue, but I could never figure out how to resolve it. I didn't test it on my PS4, but I assume from watching other reviews that its a serviceable, if unimpressive mic. Having to flip the mic boom up and down to mute yourself will become a little annoying, however, as there are no in-line controls for this beyond a volume slider on the right ear cup.Knocking off a star for both the PC mic issues as the muting mechanism.There is a DTS Headphone X two-year trial that comes with it and I strongly encourage folks to use it; it changes the sound stage of these headphones in a stellar way and everything from music, to movies, to games sounds better and has better positional audio. It's stupid that DTS X is a licensed program rather than a buy once and be done like Dolby Atmos, but that's not Kingston's fault.For PC users, the extension cable is garbage. Either I got a faulty unit, or they just plain aren't good. When plugging in the headset to the extension cable, my volume drops dramatically and there appears to be a faulty connection between the cable and the 3.5mm jack on the headset itself, as if the connection isn't strong enough. I've fiddled with the wires and can't see anything specifically wrong. When plugging the headset directly into my front audio jack, everything sounds fantastic and DTS works as it should. There is a small chance that this could be a motherboard driver issue on my end, however, so take it with a grain of salt. I'm not taking a star off for this as I very rarely, if ever, will use the mic; however, for other PC users that use one frequently, you might want to consider either a different headset, or, the better option, buying a standalone mic (headset mics are often subpar, no matter what the price point).Finally, this thing is lightweight, but not cheap feeling. It's all plastic construction minus the metal sliders, but it's very lightweight to the point of almost being unnoticeable on your head, even during long sessions. The memory foam ear cups are good, though the pleather exterior will heat up after a while and you may need to give your ears a cool off. This kind of cheap material is expected at this price point, but it still grates.Overall, they Hyper X Cloud Stinger is a great entry level headset for $50. At the $30 I got it on sale for, and the price that it is at the time of writing this, it's an absolute steal and there's nothing else at all in that range that will even come close to this.
Sadly I have a cat who has decided wired headsets are a no go. They never chewed on any other wires I have but recently the two headsets I had were of soft wire. Kitten bit right through it. One was an expensive $300+ dollar high end headset that some streamers use, though in all honesty it wasnt worth that much. You would think a $300+ dollar headset would have a wire covered in the hard braided material. None the less the wire can be replaced, for how much I dont know, but I felt going with wireless would be the safe route for now though I sacrifice sound quality greatly.Most headsets I have owned, wired, will always sound way better. Even my wired Cougar headsets were near this price or cheaper at the time but sounded like studio sound quality but I just dont want to risk it. Plus the wire was braided for that cheap. I wont be using the mic, since I have a high quality desk mic. I worry more over my mic then the headset. But for those trying to actually look for something that sounds good i would not go for these. You get what you paid for. A friend did recommend a headset a while back which I did buy and the sound quality was very very good for a wireless but it was not cheap compared to this but not as expensive as my $300+ ones. (Plantronics Gaming Headset, RIG 800HD Wireless Gaming Headset) Sadly the plastic of the Plantronics feels way thinner and cheaper than these ones. I accidentally dropped my Plantronics off my desk and part of one earphone broke and it was not repairable. I ended up tossing them out and going for the $300+ dollar headsets cause the boyfriend recommended them.For the quality of the plastic I say these feel sturdy. I can shake my head and they are not flying off. But for sound I did take a star off. I feel like the sound quality compared to cheap headphones they offer you on a plane when you forget yours. The quality is basic, clear, with not much humph to the bass. But for the price I knew the risk, and my assumptions as to how it was going to sound was right. If you really care about sound quality and dont mine going wired, id highly suggest going with wired.
PROs:+ Audio quality is surprisingly good all-around, for music, movies, gaming, and Zoom meetings+ Relatively affordable compared to some gaming headsets you might need to take loan out to afford+ Flip-to-mute mic is clear and captures audio decently+ Onboard controls are intuitively laid out+ Lightweight and comfortable to use all day+ Subtle look is suitable for an office environment+ USB-C connector charges the headset quicklyCONs:- NGenuity software is Windows-only so limits the usefulness of the headset- Software leaves a lot to be desired- USB dongle required so it will take up a USB port- No Bluetooth support- Limited to 16-bit 48khz audio- No EQ to adjust audio- Shuts off after 10 minutes with no audio (and no ability to change this)- DTS:X support is either a trial or limited basis (couldn't get mine to activate the DTS:X license)- HyperX support is terrible, so don't expect help if you need itA decent headset with good audio and some annoying limitations that aren't enough for me to dock it a star. The price is good, especially if you can find it discounted closer to $50. While not an audiophile-quality headset, the sound it does put out is surprisingly good across the board. I have not been disappointed by audio from music, movies, games, or even Zoom meetings. It is slightly bass heavy, and unfortunately (unlike some of the more expensive HyperX headsets) there is no equalizer to adjust this.However, if you want a simple headset that you don't need to fiddle around with, this should more than meet your needs. The flip-to-mute mic is always a welcome addition, and this one works well, with clear vocal audio. I wouldn't recommend this if you want to record podcasts, although it will certainly do in a pinch. It seems to handle everything quite well.I primarily use this as a backup headset when my primary headset dies, but I'm generally surprised with it each time I put it on. HyperX software and support leave A LOT to be desired, and I wish they would work on that, but with the affordable cost combined with the audio quality from the cans and microphone, I give these a lukewarm 5 stars. 4.5 stars is what I would give this if I could give it a half-star rating.
FIrst off, this is a great value for the money, its hands-down a very solid headset. I have some audiophile headsets and high end wired and wireless headsets, so I have been running the Stinger's through some gaming and music to compare. I purchased these because we have the Cloud I's and the Cloud II's in our home and I have had them for several years and they still look like new, so I knew that it would be comfortable and the sound signature would be tuned fairly well. These are a little more bass heavy in a standard gaming setup w/o a amp or Astro mixamp. The lows are very good, mids are decent, and the highs are good. Basically, the 53mm drives from the Clouds have been placed in these as 50 mm drivers because the only thing i can tell on audible testing is that the mids are clearer on my Cloud II's for gaming and music. If you use a mixamp then that is when you will not be able to tell the difference between Cloud I's or II's. I use these with a mixamp TR and they are very comfortable. I have large ears and these completely cover them while also providing decent noise cancellation. Something of note here regarding the noise cancellation, it is passive and is not as good as the Cloud II's, but I feel that the Cloud I and the II clamp down a little hard on my head and the Stingers do not clamp down. The memory foam ear pads and the lightweight frame make this a headset you will hardly notice. The build quality seems very good and as for the mic, it works fine and I have had no issues for this week of use. I would sum it up as 50 bucks well spent if you are on a budget or just looking for a comfortable headset because the Stinger's are both of those.Now a few drawbacks I see about the headset from my perspective. The mic stays attached the entire time, so that may be a negative to some. Also no built in mic monitoring that I can tell in my mic testing I have done so far. On XB1 you can setup mic monitoring within the accesories app with a newer controller model  with a 3.5 mm jack and place it to an acceptable range. On PS4 testing it is pretty much no mic monitoring, but for 50 bucks I will say that everything all works with no glaring issues and again it is mixamp friendly which is super attractive. I would definitely take these over my A40 TR's just on the fact of comfort alone, not to mention the price. I hope that Kingston ultimately takes this exact Stinger build and makes it into a Stinger II with some higher level build quality and even wireless, that would be the best gaming headset around.TLDR; The Stinger is a super comfy, mixamp friendly headset that sounds really close to its big brother the Cloud I and II's. Your going to be hard pressed to spend 50 bucks and find a better headset. I have compared many more expensive headsets to these and sound and comfort wise, these are right there with those headsets.If my review of the Kingston HyperX Cloud Stinger has helped you make a decision about purchasing please give me a postive rating.
Ive been using these for a while now so I think I can review them now.The sound is great, but they have to be sort of loud to sound great.The mic was the selling point for me, I found it handy to just flip it up to mute. Ive been told it sounds crispParts I dont like about theseA super long cable, like, annoyingly tripping over it if it's on the floor,and sending the headphones falling, long.  It's seriously almost a deal breaker for me. Some times I absolutely dont like these headphones for it.A random crackle every now and then happens when you're trying to listen to something, that my other headphones wont at all in the same spot that these crackle.
Updated to 5 stars all in all this headset is great and once I got used to it, it was very comfortable. I have decided this headset does everything I need for now so I‚Äôm going to wait to order one with a mixer and more features. I‚Äôve gotten used to the mic mute flip feature with more time and now it‚Äôs not so strange muting and adjusting volume (note: I normally adjust volume from Xbox mixer settings instead of the volume adjuster on the headset).SUMMARY: I bought the Hyperx Cloud Stinger and at this time I‚Äôm giving 4 stars, however it is most likely a 5 Star Headset I just want some time to make sure. So far I I can honestly say this headset is well worth it just keep in mind I‚Äôve only had it for about a week! It‚Äôs very comfortable, has great sound, a great price, seems to be working great with Xbox One, and is made with quality! I don‚Äôt think you find a headset in this price range that‚Äôs better than this one and many say this headset is better than very expensive ones from what I‚Äôve read. I may wind up getting another Hyperx Cloud headset with a Audio mixer and mute button since I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll get used to moving the mic up and down to mute it as you have to do with the Stinger (I‚Äôm used to a mute button by the controller which makes it fast and simple to mute) and I would like to control volume settings without going into my Xbox audio settings or hopefully Xbox makes a simplier option to this and muting. (You don‚Äôt need the adapter with this headset for Xbox one if you have the controller with a 3.5mm jack)Long Review (Still updating and pending final product rating):COMFORT: They are very comfortable to me (I am a female and most aren‚Äôt comfortable to me and are too big but without this headset adjusted at all it fits pretty comfortably). When it‚Äôs adjusted to be larger it fits my boyfriend as well so this is a great headset for either female or male.SOUND:I‚Äôm not audio/sound wizard or professional but the sound so far is very good. I‚Äôve mainly played Fortnite br and Destiny 2 with this headset. I‚Äôm still messing around with different games to see the difference between different noises and using the volume mixer settings on Xbox One to see what sounds best. On Xbox One I‚Äôm able to press the home button, go over to System, and then to Audio to control the headset volume, adjust headset chat mixer, or mic montitoring. This headset does have the slider on the right ear so you are able on XB1 to get all your volume levels setup and then just use the volume slider on the headset ear if it‚Äôs to loud or quiet. Now that I have messed around with it a bit more I don‚Äôt find the need to go back into the audio settings on Xbox to adjust them, I have left them at a certain level that seems to be working great. However, for me I liked having all those volume control settings next to the controller but again maybe I can get used to it. Last thing is I‚Äôm messing around with trying Windows Sonic and Dolby Atmos for headphones since I read you can use these features with headphones that don‚Äôt have surround sound or do have it and as some say it makes a world of a difference... I‚Äôm still testing this out on Xbox One to see if they do make a difference with sound.MIC/PARTY CHAT: Using Xbox party chat is huge and a must for me. I use it to talk to my boyfriend who I play games with from different rooms as well as friends. The first day I got these, I connected to a party chat and instantly he stated it was making a humming or some sort of low pitched noise. He isn‚Äôt into tech issues or troubleshooting so this was very hard for me to fix or understand since only he heard this noise. The next day he said he doesn‚Äôt hear it at all but I‚Äôm still a bit concerned so I‚Äôll be trying to join other people in a party to see if they hear anything not right. Update: it looks like this issue may have went away and was either related to being new, my boyfriends headset, and/or me being in the Xbox insider alpha program.MUTE FEATURE: The other thing that may just be something I have to get used to is the mic mute method on this headset, having to pull the mic up or down is something I feel takes more time than just pressing a mute button like I‚Äôm used to but like I said maybe I‚Äôll get used to it. My boyfriend likes the mute method that the Stinger has more than me since he has a habit of putting up his mic even with his mic not having this feature. I think this is just a preference and dependent on if you can get used to it.OVERALL RATING: 9/10 I would recommend this headset to someone. For the price and the quality you get I don‚Äôt feel there‚Äôs a better headset you‚Äôll find!! I hope my review helps you and if you have any questions leave a comment to this review and I‚Äôll reply ASAP.Note: I would also greatly appreciate it if my review was helpful for you, if you could please click the ‚Äúwas helpful‚Äù button below.

The mic on my last headset stopped working so I got these.  So far this headset has been great.  I really like how the mic pivots up to mute and get out of the way.  It also protects it from damage.  I think the sound is very good for both gaming and music from online sources like YouTube.  So far I really like.
I love these things! You can game with them for HOURS and they feel great the whole time! Sound quality is great and I can even walk downstairs and into my master bedroom before they start to cut out and disconnect.Literally my only complaint is I'd rather a longer charging cable, but that's not enough to tarnish how much I love these things.Highly recommend for anyone coming from wired headsets.
I‚Äôve always wanted to invest in a wireless headset but I spent so much time comparing. I added this to a private wishlist of mine to watch it when a friend mentioned she uses it and she sounded amazing in Discord calls, so when it went on a major sale, I snagged it immediately. I don‚Äôt regret it! Battery life has been wonderful, sound quality is amazing. The only thing that makes me give it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it shuts itself off if it doesn‚Äôt hear sound for a set period of time, and there‚Äôs no way to override the setting. There have been times where there has been sound on my computer, but it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs not loud enough or something, because it still shuts off. And occasionally it loses connectivity to my Discord after it shuts itself off and I have to turn it off and on again several times to be heard again. But otherwise, it‚Äôs amazing and definitely worth what I spent on it.

I wanted some over-the-ear headphones to replace my AirPods. My main gripe was battery life, and these last considerably long. They can go without charge for ~a week. The bass is barely noticeable, and the sound quality isn't that great.
They‚Äôre actually not terrible. Could be way worse for the price you get them for. At times I feel immersed in the music. When I first got them the sound sounded far away even though they‚Äôre over ear. After using them more it got better and sounds normal.Looking for budget headphones? Get these.
It's bigger than I expected but, they're pretty good.
There is a bass button on the thing. It makes no difference in any bass boost of any kind. You press it, nothing changes. I wonder if it works at all.The headset is nice and loud thats for sure. It gives bass but not heavy bass like when i bought these AWIA classic headset noise cancellation headphones. They were great. They had loud bass, and the noise you cant hear it bleed out of the headset. RIP AWIA.As for noise cancellation, its not. Its better than other chinese made headsets but even those give out better bass.The headset is better than my others as far as being more clean and loud, and gives (some) bass but nothing you would expect from other better and more expensive brands.So i gave an honest rating. Buy it if you are on a budget and if you dont care for bass too much. It gives bass but not that button and the bass is not nice and bassy.Even tried to tweak the EQ on the computer, it did nothing to the headphones.One star for bass because it sounds no different than a cheap chinese headset but the loud clear quality makes it up.
This is exactly what I was looking for! It has a great sound. I take them everywhere. They fold nicely into my bag and perfect for studying, cleaning, and traveling. AND they have a wireless option. The battery life is AMAZING!
I used it to listen to my lectures while my family were doing other activities, great sound, noise cancellation. I didn‚Äôt have an opportunity to test the bass.
Se escucha muy bien, buena calidad.
Poor mic quality. Most people had to have me repeat things several time to hear me even when talking loudly.Decently comfortable to wear.Sound is average at best.Bass function? It has a button but I can‚Äôt notice any difference.
La bater√≠a dura much√≠simo, con un uso cotidiano, me refiero a usarlos aproximadamente unas 5 horas diarias que es en el trabajo, la bater√≠a me duro m√°s de dos semanas, el sonido lo escucho bien con iPhone, pero los prob√© con un Xiaomi y se escucha mejor, con cable se escucha muy bien tambi√©n, el bass me hubiera gustado m√°s potente pero son muy buenos aud√≠fonos sin duda

I am updating after a couple of years of use as things have changed with firmware updates to warrant adding the last star to make it 5/5, but then having issues with lack of AptX support and limited control over being connected to two devices.  Something up front I think I should say about noise cancelling as there does seem to be a bit of a debate over it, is it does not block out all sounds and it does not muffle sounds equally, but for practical purposes it does do a very good job at noise cancelling striking a good balance of things and being most effective where it is needed the most to make an enjoyable listening experience.  At least this is my experience using this on a daily basis in many different environments.  I have noticed on airplanes I need to fine tune how the headset rests on my head for best results, but once finding the proper adjustment it is almost like I am in an isolation room.  Fantastic.Overall I am seeing this as well worth the money, a big step up over a much older generation of this product line I had been using, and definitely a huge step up over what came with my phone.  I bought this right after upgrading my phone, so in the past week have found some issues were not the head phone's fault, but instead default sound settings I have since adjusted.  Also been getting more adjusted to the noise cancellation, which is really a great feature of this headset.For some things I really like about this headset:1. I have a huge head and this fits nicely on it; even covers my large ears comfortably.  Almost no over the ear headphones do this and I have looked far and wide.  My head is just too big for pretty much all except this particular line of headphones / headsets.  In the ear headsets irritate my ears after a while, causing my ear canals to swell up.  So having something tolerable let alone comfortable to the point that I almost forget they are on is a huge plus.  They also fit on my wife's normal sized head just fine, so it covers a wide range of head sizes pretty well.2. The sound quality and frequency range is great.  While I would like frequency sliders in their app, the hard coded balance across the range is pretty darn good.  Some reviews say there is a different headset that sounds better, but especially after this latest update, I am having trouble finding room for improvement; it sounds excellent across the range, even deep bass.  The main limit I hit is a streaming service I use defaulted back to low quality when I upgraded my phone, so deep bass was crushed a bit and overall was not sounding as good as my home computer which has been the same machine for a while now (where I got the quality options set right a while back), but resetting the values and clearing the cache has fixed this issue.  Really with noise cancelling mixed in I am hearing a lot more detail that would normally get washed out from background noise and my desire to keep volume levels down in order to preserve my hearing.  Have the best of both worlds now.3. In call sound quality is reported to be good across a number of calls now, even from the datacenter floor.  Especially considering this does not have a boom mic, that is pretty good.  I remember in the past getting a call on the datacenter floor with a lesser headset and nobody could hear anybody.  Then again they have been moving servers to the cloud and the remaining servers are running cooler with the reduced heat load on the CRACs and thus their fans have slowed a bit, bit it is still really loud in there, so both parties hearing loud and clear is pretty amazing.4. The battery really does go the distance and I would venture to say the 20 hour rating would be for harsh use cases where my main use case is mellow office building use.  I am thinking more like 25 hours in an office.  I just love how my newer devices can just go and go on batteries, at least initially where in the past battery life started off too short an then quickly became frustratingly way too short.  Starting off with plenty of time I have some room to do some battery life extension tricks like limiting the charge window manually.  Now if this was something built into the product like what you can do with a Tesla car, that would be really nice as changing out batteries every two years or so, especially with how devices are built these days is a bit of a PITA and too often goes badly.5.  For sound cancellation, I have to say there is something to be said for pretty much all of the ambient noise just going away and it just being dead silent.  Seems to weird some people out, but I think it is great.  Can still hear people talk and other loud sounds, but I seems to be rather muffled.  Also it seems to be good at figuring out what is white noise and clearing that out completely where some other frequencies that are more useful get through better.  Also love being able to walk down a busy street and hear my music, especially without having to sacrifice my eardrums in the process, especially as a lot of really loud noise around freeways and such are really muffled down.  Found in a noisy data center that if I were to go to the barber, they would work better, but still work quite well with the hair I have, just little bit of bleed through sound from the excess hair around my ears.  Pressing the headphones down causes things to get a lot quieter.  Plenty good for easy on the ear drum music listening while in the data center.  Have used for other things like muffling noisy power tools and having my wife watch her TV next to me and not be distracted by anything at all.  Beginning to think this could be the beginnings of a great relationship... Oh wait a sec.My complaints so far are:1. My #1 complaint is removed as it seems to have been fixed with the latest firmware update as I thought would be possible.  Star added back.  Thanks Bose!2. I have noticed doors around the office that automatically slam shut while this headset muffles the higher frequencies, the lowest frequencies seem amplified and so it is like my head is getting hit with a sound pressure wave.  Been thinking about this more and I have been moving in the direction of what this does muffle, it does so well that what it does not effectively muffle seems quite loud as the ears adjust to the greatly reduced sound levels hitting them overall.3. The radio antenna seems to be on the right side only.  Being a lefty I like putting my phone on the left side, but that just does not go well.  Have to use the right side when going for a walk.  People call me a 'giant', so there is a lot of body for the signal to go through, so most people will probably never notice this issue.4. No AptX support.  When connected to TV bluetooth, lips are out of sync.  The delay is maybe 170ms, so the delay is in the realm of something I can accept.  For those who can't stand this kind of issue, then the Sony option is for you.5. Not much control over which source plays when connected to two devices at the same time.  If two devices are playing at the same time it will just pick one it seems.  Doing things like connected to phone and TV at the same time, well TV will just cut out with the slightest sound from the phone.  Would be nice if the headset would mix the two sources or if I could set it to say prefer the TV and only switch to the phone when the TV stops.  Also use this with my laptop and see the same deal.  It is nice at least I have have a few different devices to connect to.  It is just if I really want to get serious with my laptop or desktop computer, I have to use the audio cable for the previous version of this headset for a combination of dedicated sound, low latency sound, and mic support, especially in COVID-19 days where I am on video conferences all the time and the webcam mic is not nearly as good as the mic on this headset at least in terms of eliminating various room scale artifacts that annoy the hell out of people in video conferences.  Would be nice if I could do this all from bluetooth, but sadly bluetooth is mainly for system sounds and music, which is still really handy when I am not on a conference call.
I left a lengthy review comparing the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. This is a shorter version of that review, mostly focusing on QC35II and E285. This was almost entirely written up during the week I had all four headsets for direct comparisons.Microphone and PlaybackQC35II recordings were consistently louder than the E285. But the E285 did a far better job of removing background noise, as evidenced by my recordings while drumming. Muting can be done with the QC35II but it was much more difficult than just raising/lowering the boom arm of the E285.Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophileE285 and SX4 audio sound better than the QC35II but primarily because I can use an equalizer and increase bass (obviously this is the most important factor). Even if the QC35II had better hardware, it‚Äôs not as accessible and therefore is a moot point. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.BrandBose: wanted my location and would ask for it every time I open the app (and wouldn‚Äôt allow usage without accepting beyond the standard Bluetooth connection process). These are headphones. You don‚Äôt need my location.Jabra: doesn‚Äôt require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice! Win for Jabra. Runner up is Sony.ANCWhen standing in front of running water, QC35II had slightly better cancellation, but not a noticeable difference without actively concentrating. When playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I‚Äôm looking for), whereas the others don‚Äôt quite succeed. During testing of the QC35II, whether ANC was on/off, there was a ceaseless light static (with no audio playing). I thought it quite odd and luckily, it didn‚Äôt happen again, but I suppose it could. With the QC35II, when the drum pad was hit, there was a tang sound, like the residual sound from tapping on a pan, as opposed to the muffled thumping the E285 gives. Perhaps with a constant noise the QC35II does a slightly better job filtering, but the E285 does a better job with impact noises (or maybe it‚Äôs just higher frequencies).In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. With the QC35II ANC off, it sounds like the microphone is picking up sound and then replaying it in the speakers. In contrast, the E285 hear-through, which has adjustable levels, almost makes it sound like you‚Äôre not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.ConnectivityThe E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. QC35II, SX4, and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn‚Äôt the B700? Because it sucks.Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it‚Äôs just plug-and-play, no downloads or ‚Äúconnecting‚Äù. The QC35II and SX4 are only Bluetooth, so you have to do the standard ‚Äúadd device‚Äù, etc. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer‚Äôs humble opinion.Response time: the QC35II and B700 have a slightly faster response time when pausing media than the E285. The SX4 is the fastest, though we‚Äôre talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 also have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Again, the E285 feel lack-luster in comparison because they take approximately 4 M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-I seconds to pause, whereas the SX4 is half that time. For the E285, I‚Äôve noticed the ear detection only works properly when playing music from your phone and not the PC. When using it with the PC, if I remove the headphones, the music will pause as it should. But it doesn‚Äôt resume when I put them back on. If I pause the music with the button, then remove the headset, it resumes. Again, cool feature, but needs work, especially when using it with the PC.App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. Some issues with QC35II (Bose Connect). LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then. I can‚Äôt say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Win for SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.Voice AssistantCouldn‚Äôt even get B700 to work. First off, I have to change the ‚Äúaction‚Äù button from ANC control to activate voice assistant (so you can‚Äôt have both functionalities at the same time). However, once button mapping was adjusted accordingly, I click the button and it says ‚Äúopen your Google Assistant settings‚Äù, with no further instructions. I open the Home app, and once again, no further instructions, so I didn‚Äôt get it working. I didn‚Äôt spend anymore time on it because in contrast, the E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature (you can still press the action button with the boom arm up and have the assistant prompt, but because the arm is up, the microphone is off so it‚Äôs pointless). Perhaps Bose has better functionality when used with Alexa, but I use Google so I‚Äôm not bothering with testing that. Tie between E285 and SX4.I know this is extremely nit-picky, but the Bose assistant‚Äôs voice is far more annoying than Jabra or Sony. She sounds like an actual robot as opposed to someone I wouldn't mind meeting.ControlsThe QC35II and E285 have essentially the exact same button layout and functionality. The key difference is the action button on QC35II. It can be EITHER for voice assistant or cycling through ANC. On the other hand, you can access both functionalities on the E285, with the caveat of lowering the boom arm first for the voice assistant. The other difference is placement of the power button. On the QC35II, it‚Äôs a lateral switch on the side of the right ear cuff. On the E285, it‚Äôs a vertical switch on the bottom of the left ear. I literally don‚Äôt have a preference between the two. However, I do have a preference for the other buttons. While in the same place (the action button on the QC35II is in the same place as the ANC cycling button on the E285), the QC35II has a much more noticeable difference between the volume buttons and the play/pause, which I like better. All the buttons are bigger and more defined, plus the volume buttons are slightly raised, making it even easier to know what you‚Äôre pressing. On the E285, the buttons take up less surface area and are rather flat.Muting is definitely easier with the E285 because you simply raise or lower the boom mic. Though it also  takes a little longer. The QC35II is more annoying because you have to press two buttons at the same time (the volume buttons). Win for SX4 (touchless controls are better). Runner up is E285.Comfort and StyleI prefer the QC35II. Though I‚Äôve been wearing the E285 for a little over an hour and was so comfortable, I had to look to my left to see which headset I wasn‚Äôt wearing. So both are very comfortable, but for comparison‚Äôs sake, it‚Äôs a win for QC35II. Runner up is E285/SX4 (just as comfortable).ExtraThe E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don‚Äôt want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate‚Äôs drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there‚Äôs nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.IssuesMy biggest issue was trying to connect QC35II with my Google Assistant. Besides that, functionality of the QC35II was pretty much flawless. Speaking of Google Assistant, there‚Äôs some variability with functionality with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars while the QC35II I gave two. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. Even so, the E285 is better in just about every way. Stronger connection, more functionality, better app, better audio, better background noise removal (though the QC35II you could maybe argue is better at ANC, but not during a call). As far as functionally using the QC35II, I would give it three stars. But I give it two because the Bose app REQUIRES your location and that is absolutely ludicrous. It's a pair of headphones. You don't need my location. Note - if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.
I give it five stars. My wife hates them she would give it 1. I put them on and that‚Äôs it. I can‚Äôt hear her any more.
Around the holidays, I decided to treat myself to a pair of high quality headphones. I live in the central area of a major US city, and to be frank the noise pollution was driving me a little crazy. I was interested in a pair of headphones that would give me some peace and quiet, so I spent a lot of time looking at ANC (active noise-Cancelling) options and the Sony WH1000MX3 and Bose QuietComfort 35 II were easily the top picks among reviews.However, there were a lot of different opinions about which was better. The split was about 50/50 between the Sony and Bose, so I was pretty torn. Even though they were heavily discounted for the holidays ($280 each), that's a lot of money considering I generally never spend more than $50 for headphones. So I bought them both as an experiment, with the plan to return one after I made a decision.Let me get this out of the way now, because I'm going to get pretty detailed below. Ultimately, I understand why there's such a debate about whether the Sony or Bose is better. They are both fantastic headphones. I loved them so much that I made the probably financially irresponsible decision to keep them both! They were both so good, but better than the other in completely unique ways. For that reason, there was no dealbreaker for me that makes one superior than the other -- It really comes down completely to personal preference and that's why there is so much debate.The TL;DR of this review is that you should buy the Sony if you value sound quality most, and don't plan to wear them for long periods of time (i.e. over 5-6 hours per session). You should buy the Bose if you value comfort the most, and if you're planning to use them for phone calls.If you're interested in a bit more detail, I'll give my opinions on these aspects: ANC, Sound, Comfort, VersatilityANCThe noise-cancelling on both of these is phenomenal. I had assumed Bose would do better at this since it's what they're known for, but I'm surprised to say the Sony's ANC is slightly better. It does a bit better blocking out non-drone sounds (i.e. people talking, sharp noises, etc) compared to the Bose. With that said, they both are practically equal and I don't think the Sony ANC is so much better than the Bose that it would justify buying them on that factor alone. When wearing either pair, I sometimes feel like a spaceman walking around my apartment because everything is so quiet.SOUNDThis is a clear winner for Sony. No questions asked, the sound is clearer, crisper, and deeper. This is especially noticeable when watching movies/TV shows or playing video games. With the Sony, I feel like I can hear each individual sound clearly, whereas with the Bose everything is a little more muddled together. With that being said, the Bose sound is perfectly acceptable and even 'good'. It's just that for a $300 pair of headphones I'd expect a more premium quality where I am amazed at how clear the sound is. The Sony does that; the Bose are a tier below.COMFORTHands down, the Bose are better. I can literally wear them for 14 hours and they don't bother me except for needing to give my ears a little air every once in a while. I have never, ever worn a pair of headphones this comfortable before. I'm especially grateful for this comfort now that I'm working from home all day because of COVID-19. The Sony headphones are a bit heavier and clamp on your head a little bit more tightly. They also press down on your ears, whereas the Bose are deep enough that my ears don't even touch the inside of the cans. The Sony are still definitely comfortable, but a tier below the Bose. I can still wear them for about 6 hours before they bother me, so if you don't wear headphones that long it might not be a problem for you.VERSATILITYThis is just a catch-all for all the other aspects of the headphones. Nothing here I would consider a selling point strong enough for most people to make a final decision, but if you have specific needs then this might be helpful.1. I like the physical buttons on the Bose more than the touch buttons on the Sony. They just work better, and I make mistakes with them less often.2. Sony has better technology. They use USB-C so the headphones charge faster than the Bose mini-hdmi. They also have better bluetooth connection technology, which lets a higher bitrate of audio transfer wirelessly. Without getting too technical, I think this is a major reason why the sound quality on the Sony is better.3.  Bose is better if you want to connect to multiple devices. Bose can connect to two devices simultaneously, but Sony can connect to only 1 device at a time. For example, if I am listening to music on my computer and I get a phone call, if I'm wearing the Bose, I can answer and talk on the call through my headset, and when I hang up music will resume. With the Sony, I'd either have to disconnect from my computer, then reconnect to my phone  before the call ended, or take off the headphones completely and answer the phone separately.4. Sony looks a little more stylish and futuristic. The Bose look like an ordinary pair of headphones. Build quality is identical thoughCONCLUSION5 months after buying these, do I regret keeping them both? NO! They are absolutely worth the money if you have it. Generally, I find that I wear the Bose throughout the day as I'm working from home. They're really comfortable to wear all day long, if I get a call from a co-worker I don't need to take them off, and I'm just listening to music as background noise while I work so sound quality isn't important. After dinner, it's always the Sony. When I'm focusing on a new album, watching a movie, or playing a video game, I really value how good the sound is. And generally I only wear them for 3-4 hours at this point so discomfort is never an issue.If you twist my arm about it and made me pick only one pair to own the rest of my life? I'd probably take the Bose just because I wear them so much while working from home. But that's not a fair metric, and each individual will have a different primary purpose for these and that should be your guiding principal when making the choice.Good luck! (longest review over)
I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very "clean" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as "calming". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don't expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn't play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can't connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...
UPDATE: Took a few tries of the phone system hanging up on me, but got through to Bose, and their policy covers situations like this. They are replacing the headset with a Quiet Comfort 45.If you're considering these, note that the newer version Quiet Comfort 45 is less expensive.When the headset works, it's pretty good - I work from home and have calls throughout the day. These switched easily between my computer and phone, though there was sometimes some lag when switching devices to my phone for the sound to start again. Sometimes I had the impression my voice didn't come through outgoing so well, as people didn't react to what I said right away or had to turn up the volume on their end. Otherwise they served me well for work.Also, I had my roof replaced in a three story townhome, and was still able to work that day using these. Didn't quite work for stucco work right outside my office, but there's only so much noise anything can block out.INITIAL REVIEW THOUGHTS:Cannot believe it. I ordered these 11/17/2021, and today 11/18/2022 they just stopped playing sound even when connected to my phone. No longer under 1-yr warranty. No sound...Even when I turn them off and back on. Even when I disconnect and reconnect. Even when I restart my phone. Too expensive for this.
The Bose QC35 II is by far the best pair of headphones I‚Äôve owned...and I have used quite a few...I haven‚Äôt owned this long enough to give feedback on battery and interaction w/my Echo Show (Alexa) but I‚Äôm hoping those will be good experience.I‚Äôm here mostly for those who are considering investing in these great headphones for the purpose of singing in Smule (the Sing app).First of all, I think it‚Äôs pretty ridiculous that Bose would include an audio cable/wire without including a MIC audio wire!  But since it‚Äôs not a big deal and no big investment, this is resolved by purchasing a 3.5mm wire w/mic, right? WRONG!To make matters a bit more frustrating for consumers such as myself, not only Bose made the female input jack in these headphones smaller than 3.5mm but they also make no mention of it in the owner‚Äôs manual.  To say such thing is super lame on Bose‚Äôs part is gross understatement!So...if you are indeed thinking of buying these to use with Smule app, you‚Äôll need to invest in good audio wire with microphone (I invested in Beats mic wire...can be found at Walmart for $20) and had to purchase a 3.5mm female converter with a 2.5mm male plug in order to connect the Beats mic wire to my new QC35 II.  Now, what was BOSE thinking?  After all, they know about Smule and how the worldwide popular singing app has and is creating plenty market for the audio equipment industry...and Bose didn‚Äôt impress me when it comes to making it rather inconvenient to use these Bluetooth headphones work w/wired mics.And no, I haven‚Äôt found any headphones with wired mics that supersede the sound quality that my Bose QC35 II headphones render.  So it‚Äôs something for Bose to improve...and their marketing folks ought to know better than omit important info from consumers.  While Bluetooth option is an awesome thing, there remains certain online activities that require wired mics...Smule being one...and trust me, I‚Äôve tried using ‚Äústate of the art‚Äù expensive audio equipment to sing in Smule and even the most advanced of audio equipments (such hand held microphones; stand mics (Yeti), mic filters, digital headphones, etc, etc) render poor audio result compared to using wired mics with a good set of headphones.  As far as Smule sing app goes, even cheap earbuds do far better (because it has wired mics!) than expensive audio equipment without wired mic!So either Bose ‚Äúforgot‚Äù that some of us need wired mics w/a 3.5mm male plug, and by the way, that‚Äôs SUPER USEFUL for when battery time is shorter than the consumer intends to use these headphones for, or Bose purposely made these nice headphones w/a 2.5mm female input to make us go out and spend more money just to plug into their nice Bluetooth headphones??Whatever the reason, I expected a LOT BETTER from BOSE, especially while paying almost $400 (that price includes extra service protection warranty) for A PAIR OF HEADPHONES that don‚Äôt even come with a wired mic and HAVE NO input to connect a 3.5mm audio cable to the headphones! I feel that there‚Äôs always some type of sound quality loss when we have to use adaptor connectors so I truly don‚Äôt understand why Bose chose to make the QC35 II with a 2.5mm female input in the headset while providing a cable that has no mic in it!  Yes, some use these just to listen to music, videos, news, etc.  But what if I‚Äôm listening to something in my device while wearing these and using the audio wire and my mother or a friend calls me via FaceTime or Facebook messenger or whatever else?  I can easily accept the video call but must unplug the headphones, which usually causes an audio problem in the video conference app, because it doesn‚Äôt transfer audio, once the audio device first used is disconnected. Something Bose seems to have completely disregarded.  Obviously, the focus in these is the Bluetooth capabilities.  But I ask Bose this question: why would I buy a wired pair of Bose headphones that cost not a lot less than these while getting less quality sound?  So if these work with audio cable, which it does, why not include an audio cable with a mic???  Charge the extra $20 or so dollars for goodness sake but it‚Äôs pretty sad to make such great quality headphones without sending it with a wired mic while knowing that the microphones in our devices don‚Äôt handle all recordings and are not designed to work well with singing apps!  Headphones aren‚Äôt just for listening!  What do professional singers wear when recording their songs inside a studio?? HEADPHONES!  Is it important for them to hear their own voices through the headphones they wear? You bet!  This is why those headphones are well connected with whatever microphones professional singers and studios use.  The same is true for ordinary, amateur singers such as myself.  But unlike pro singers, all we ordinary singers need is a wired mic that connects directly to the fancy expensive Bose headphones we invest on!It‚Äôs a BOSE so yes, they are awesome headphones.  But needless to say I‚Äôm rather disappointed.  I can‚Äôt use these until the extra pieces arrive and worse than that, I had to find out the hard way!  Nothing in the specs here or even in the Bose website or in the owner‚Äôs manual shows that these headphones have a 2.5mm female input to the audio cable.  I feel a wired mic w/the appropriate size plug should be something to expect in a pair of headphones that cost $350!!!! Most of all, I feel that any type of electronic should come with pictures of it indicating the physical parts inside and outside of it.Bose mentions that they include the 3.5mm audio cable.  Unfortunately, they make NO mention that the end of the audio cable which plugs into the headphones is actually size 2.5mm!REALLY, BOSE??  A $20 mic wire with the correct size male plug to fit into the headset unconventional female input size would‚Äôve saved a lot of frustration here...not to count given you a perfect ‚Äú5 stars‚Äù score...
I have had these headphones for about 2 years and have used them almost every day during that time. The material on the ear padding is wearing away now but this doesn't affect my comfort when wearing these. The headphones have been dropped many times over the time I have owned them and come apart once, but I have been able to put the pieces back together and they have stayed together.Overall, they are comfortable and sound great for my first pair of premium headphones, and as I have detailed they boast good build quality. I will probably buy another one of these or the next model up when these inevitably break from use, and I can highly recommend getting them.
After doing a lot of research, it ultimately came down to the Bose QC 35 and Sony 1000XM2.  I tried them both for several days but in the end, the Bose QC 35 was my choice, which wasn't an easy one to make.  You can't go wrong with either pair as they are both very nice headphones.  The final decision for me was whether I wanted a little better quality (Sony) or better fit/comfort (Bose).  I chose comfort and the Bose 1000XM2.  Here are some other things I noticed...SOUND QUALITY:No question at all, the Sony 1000Xm2 are better sounding headphones.  Don't get me wrong, the Bose are still very good.  However, I really liked and preferred the bass response of the Sony over the Bose.  Bose are the brighter sounding headphones but the biggest difference was how they sound with bass, which Sony does better.FIT / COMFORT:The Bose gets the edge on fit/comfort.  They are VERY comfortable and light!  The Sony 1000xm2 are fine but they fit a bit more snug than Bose.  At first, I actually preferred the Sony fit.  However, after having them on for an hour or longer, that's where I noticed the biggest difference... ear fatigue.  Much less ear fatigue with the Bose.  That all being said, what is more comfortable to me might be less comfortable to you.  You just have to try them on, ideally for extended periods of time.  I bought these particularly when I fly where I plan to wear them for hours at a time.  Even though I prefer the sound quality of the Sony, I just couldn't get over the incredibly comfortable fit of the Bose.BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY:Both do a fine job here but the Bose were the more reliable in establishing a connection without having to fiddle around with settings.  When comparing the Sony and the Bose, I often went back and forth trying when trying out the headphones.  Every time that I went back to the Bose, it was fast and easy.  With the Sony pair, I had to go into my Bluetooth settings a few times in order to get a connection.  It really wasn't a big deal but the Bose gets the edge here because it is painless and works more reliably.DURABILITY:I won't give either pair the edge here because I only had them for a week BUT do keep in mind that the Sony 1000xm1 had issues with the headband cracking.  Because Sony hasn't clearly stated whether they resolved the issue with the xm2's, it's anyone's guess.  This alone probably wouldn't keep me from going with the XM2's but it is something to consider.CONTROLS:I like them both and consider this a toss up.  With the Sony pair, you just swipe the headphones to control the music and volume while the Bose has hard buttons.  At first, I definitely preferred the hard buttons that are on the Bose.  However, after getting used to swiping on the Sony's, I found it easy enough to do.  Which do I prefer?  Probably the hard buttons because they are a bit more reliable than the swiping.  This is very subjective though and I could see some preferring the swiping while others preferring the hard buttons.  It just depends on what you like.  For me, I found both to work fine.  The Sony does have a feature where you can put you hand over the right headphone and it will allow you to hear outside noise without having to take them off.  Cool feature?  Maybe for some but for me, I didn't see any use for it.  If someone approaches me while wearing big headphones like these, I'm going to take them off my head rather than keeping them on with my hand cupping the right headphone.  It just seems a bit rude not to do so.FEATURES:They both have their pluses and minuses here.  It really depends on what is most important to you.  I really like how the Sony 1000XM2 allows you to customize the sound (including equalizer).  It also has the ability to modify you settings depending on where you are listening to them by simply pressing a button.  I don't really no what impact that has though because I only tried this a couple of times.  The fact of the matter is that Sony provides a bit more customization which I like!  The Bose has google assistant which I found to be a cool feature.  I could live without this but it is a nice feature.  The feature that I found VERY useful on the Bose is the ability to play text messages through the headphones.  I was on a flight recently where we were waiting for our turn to take off.  While listening to my music, I was notified that I had a text message.  Instead of having to reach for my phone (Sony) the Bose pair allowed me to just push the action button to hear the text.  I found this awesome.  Sony does not have this feature.  What headphones gets the edge?  For me, it's another toss up.  I really like the customization of the Sony but the Bose are very cool with being able to read my text messages (and google assistant).LOOKS:They both look great!  I had the gold/beige Sony's and the silver Bose.  I might give a slight edge to Bose as I like the silver look and the Bose logo on each headphone.  However, this is very subjective.SUMMARY:This is one of those times where you just can't go wrong with either pair.  They both have their pros and cons but in the end, for me, I prefer the Bose QC 35 by a very small margin.
I wanted a new headset for everyday activities. I work on the computer quite often editing videos so I needed something comfortable and cozy. I was initially very hesitant because the price tag was a bit hard to justify on a headset. Saw that the price was slashed during the holiday season and quickly pulled the trigger!The build quality is very nice and strong. I am definitely a huge fan of how the headset is able to fold so that it makes carrying it very easy and portable. Also, it comes with a nice case to hold the headset as well!After trying it on, my mind was blown! This is totally worth the money, just everything about it was pretty nice! The fit, sound, and build, I liked everything about it! I liked this headset so much that I bought additional wires to use them for gaming as well!
https://www.amazon.com/JVC-Sized-Headband-Black-HARX330/product-reviews/B01N8U5175/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews
These are great headphones for the price.  I wanted a cheap pair of headphones to watch/listen to movies on my laptop.  My laptop has great sound with great bass when listening to the built in speakers.  However, when listening with the ear buds I was using I lost virtually all the bass and even the sound volume was lacking on some movies. I don't care for earbuds but that's what I had.  I didn't want to get another cheap pair of the lightweight headphones as I've not found a pair of those that can deliver decent sound, last without breaking for any period of time or have the cord break off.  I decided to go with a cheaper pair of full size headphones.  Based on price and reviews, I decided to take a chance on these.  I was willing to spend a little more but after reading the reviews and looking at the features/details of the lower priced headphone options, I kept coming back to these.  So far I'm quite pleased with them.  They deliver an amount of bass I would not have expected from these headphones.  I think the key to these headphones for me (and maybe others) is to use them with a source where you can adjust the bass and treble.  The bass, while excellent, CAN be a bit "booming" (as stated by others) depending on the source.  It is times like that where having a source where you can  decrease the bass and/or increase the treble really helps.  Having an EQ of some sort on the sound source makes these headphones shine.  The build quality is "OK" I guess and on par with the cost.  I have some concerns on how the head-band will hold up over time.  It is somewhat thin (but flexible) plastic.  It's hard to say because there are some plastics that are so pliable that you couldn't break them if you tried.  But, there is really no way to know that ahead of time.  The other pieces of the headphones that concern me are the hard plastic pieces where the ear-cups attach to the head-band.  These are a hard plastic which I have concerns about breaking.  I've had full size, high quality, expensive gaming headphones break in this same spot before.  I'm always apprehensive about that spot breaking on full size headphones if made from hard plastic.  The headphones are comfortable even for long term use.  The cord is quite long but for laptop use I just keep it tied up with a twist tie.  A 1/4" adapter is included for use with a home stereo receiver or other devices having a 1/4" headphone jack.  One of the things I would have liked to have seen (as echoed by others) is an in-line volume control.  Being able to adjust the volume on the headphones or on the cord is a nice feature I wish they would have added.  The head-band is not padded and I thought I was going to have an issue with the comfort being it's just bare plastic.  However, I'm happy to say that after many uses, I don't even notice the hand band at all.  Some people may have an issue with it but for me the headphones are light enough in weight that they don't pull down on the headband enough to make it a comfort issue.For the money I don't think you can go wrong with these headphones.  They provide very good sound quality and are a good choice if you don't want to spend a lot of money on headphones you're not sure if you will like.  I paid $13.xx for these which I think is a great price given that they are a full size headphone and given the great sound quality.  Pick up a set and give them a try.  The only people I see perhaps NOT liking these headphones would be those using them with a MP3 player or other device that doesn't have any bass/treble controls.  The bass might be a little much (booming) for those people but again, it depends on the sound source.Pros:Very good sound quality.  The ear cups are deeply padded and comfortable even for long periods of time.  There is a single cord coming down from one side of the headphones instead of some models which have a cord from each side coming down.  There is enough adjustment to fit a larger size head.  Long cord.  1/4 inch adapter is included (for those that need it).  Look good.  Low cost.Cons:Somewhat cheap materials (plastic head-band / hard plastic attaches ear-cups to head-band). Long term durability unknown.  No volume control on headphones or cord (you know this going in if you've read the reviews).  Bass is somewhat booming (can be mitigated using sound source with EQ or other controls).
I run a podcast and I was searching for an affordable solution that provided three key factors: Comfort, Clarity, and Compactness. The comfort factor was the most important because if you are going to have a few of your guests wearing these for an hour, they need to feel like nothing is there. Clarity for the quality of the sound and to make sure your guests hear themselves clearly. Compactness for a podcast that has to go to multiple places.I tested these JVC HARX500 against the following: JVC HARX330, Monoprice Premium Hi-Fi Dj Style,Vogek On Ear Headphones with Mic, Tascam TH-02, Koss UR20, and Panasonic RP-HT161-K.Here is how they stacked up:JVC HARX330: decent clarity and lower profile for over the ear headphones but they really hurt my ears because they didn't completely cover my earsMonoprice Premium Hi-Fi Dj Style: If this purchase was for just listening to music or doing something other than my needs, this would have been my choice. The set was comfortable, albeit a bit on the heavy side and the clarity was unsurpassed. By far the best of all. However, these headphones had a good seal around my ears and I was unable to hear ambient noise. As a podcaster, I need to be aware of A/C units running in the background and I was unable to hear mine when wearing this. For my purposes, I need to be able to hear things that the microphone may or may not pick up.Vogek On Ear Headphones with Mic: I tried these just to see if on-ear headphones would work. Not for the comfort factor. However, these won the compact prize. They could fold up to the size of my palm which was a bonus.Tascam TH-02: with all the great reviews, I thought this was going to be a winner. However, it was very bulky and didn't fit on my head properly. Good quality sound but still not great. So it didn't win the prize for comfort because of its weight. These however did fold so they could have gotten a bonus point for compactness.Koss UR20: These things were a beast. This means it didn't pass the compact test. However, the sound clarity was terrible. I was amazed at how distorted voices were. It sounded like every time I talked I could hear myself clipping and I didn't hear that with any other headphone.Panasonic RP-HT161-K: Decent slimmer profile but didn't pass the comfort test.The JVC HARX500 met 2 of the 3 conditions I felt were the most important, comfort and clarity. After putting on these headphones, I just felt like I could easily have them on for hours without any worry of fatigue or my ears hurting. The sound coming from the speakers was true to self and was great for the price point. As mentioned above, it still allows some ambient noise to penetrate so you can hear background noise and isn't completely noise isolation which I needed. These fail the compact use case but they are still slimmer in profile compared to the Monoprice and Koss ones. I can overlook that for the top 2 needs

Excellent set of basic, no-frills, over the ear headphones.  Crank the volume because these things thump.  Good sound quality, no distortion even when the bass is blasting.  Cable is nice and long, making it easy to plug into a home stereo system.
I purchased these because I wanted inexpensive knock around computer over-the-earheadphones.I also own the JVC HA-RX700 o-t-e headphones as well and will include the specs andmy observations.The 500s definitely do not have the audio dynamics that the 700s present. The specsspeak for themselves on these two models. Not as much bass and mid-range whencompared to the RX700. The bass is okay for the price. You get what you pay forbetween the two.The 500s are light weight and do not over burden the ears or the head. I have averagesize ears and they just fit into the ear pads. I have found the 700s, after an hour,to feel heavy on the head but still comfortable. The ear pads on the 700s are a bitbigger and fit around my ears very well.The 500s does not keep out all the exterior noise as well as the 700s. Neither do aperfect job but the 700s due to having a better build and better audio dynamics keepout more extraneous noise.I tried out the 500 and the 700 on my Blackstar HT-5R amp. Definitely much more dynamicaudio with the 700. The 500 can't even keep up with the 700s ability to go deep intobass or reproduce the mids and highs.Here are some specs to compare:.....

I did notice that the 500has a thinner cord than the 700. What that means I am not sure.I believe the 500s are discontinued so one can still shop  around and find a goodcloseout price. I paid about $20 American in January 2013. The RX700s, ran about$34.00 when purchased in June of 2012.The RX700s are worth the extra $10 in terms of overall sound. If you feel you will beusing the 700 for longer than an hour you may want to find some comparable phones thatare lighter. Or you can do more neck exercises. Will more expensive headphones, $50-150,be more comfortable? I don't know. I would hope that would be the case.I gave the RX500s four stars because of the price paid, relative comfort over an hour andthe the sound delivered.------------------------------UPDATE 04/25/2014: The Rx500s are still going strong and still intact. No breakage orwearing on the cord. I use them exclusively inside the home on my computer.
I've had the JVC HARX500 -over ear- Headphones now for a week.What I wanted:1. Replace existing (in)ear-buds due to wear and poor sound quality.2. Be able to hear more bass, mids, treble...better sound quality.3. High comfort and stylish, as I commute on the train everyday to work & school.4. Good price.5. Noise cancellationI already own a pair of professional studio headphones (Sennheiser), which i've had for more than 5 years. But they are big and not for wear 'on the street' - I just use them for in the music studio.I've been drumming for 13 years -both in studios & live on stage-, and I have high expectations when I listen to music, whether at home, in the car, or on my mp3 player (Phillips GoGear vibe). I need to hear it all & it annoys me when the sound isn't right, like the basic EQ levels. I am always changing them to suit the song I'm listening to. I listen to a wide variety of music; from 90's grunge to temporary psychadelic trance to jazz and talk radio and everything in between.That said though, I am a college student, so I didn't expect to be able to find something with high quality sound for what I was able/willing to spend.I read pretty much all the reviews for the headphones in my price range and decided to get these JVC HARX500's. At first the 300's seemed enough but for $7 more you get the Neodymium Driver. JVC has always been a favorite of mine when choosing any music related electronics and I am, again, really happy with these headphones. The sound is well distributed between crispness and lower range. The structure is sturdy, yet flexible and not too heavy.It meant all my expectations:1. Good replacement for my old in-ear plugs, and I will add that it probably will be a for any, as the over-the-ear provide so much more depth to the sound.2. I think the bass is really nice. Not too muddy or too much. The mid's are right on par, and the treble is cristal clear. If you have an equalizer, I suggest fooling around to find your own personal sound preferences.3. These headphones are really comfy. You can adjust them every which way and (like mentioned in other reviews) the 'muffs' can turn to fit your ears. They are not too big, so I can easily put them in my backpack, and on the train, or walking around they, don't say "look at me". The cord is too long for my comfort, but I just tie it up, and stick it in my pants/jacket pocket. The headphones also even keep my ears warm in the winter!4. The price is, for such a high quality product of its kind, really unbeatable.5. I can turn this bad boy up and not hear a thing when your talking to me, or other background noises like trains (stations), cars, buses. I just 'tune out' and enjoy the music!In short, if your looking for these things I mentioned in new headphones...get this one and you wont be disappointed.
Love these headphones. Really good sound. Fits nice over the ears and is comfortable over after long use.
Wow!! Just received today. Don't know where to start. These are truly fantastic in every regard! I listen to all kinds of music and have owned expensive stereo systems in my car and home.  This review concerns using the HA-RX500's listening to music through my PC. I am very particular about quality.  I want to hear all the details in a piece of recorded music and want background parts at the right sound level in relation to the other instruments/vocals in a song. These headphones have AMAZING sound--not for $20--just amazing sound in their own right. I read a review that said they have better sound quality than a $120 pair of headphones, and I couldn't agree more. Sound is rich and full. Can hear all layers of all types of music.  Bass is very impressive as are the highs, but what truly impressed me, and which I have found lacking in two other sets of headphones I recently ordered, is the quality of the mid-range sounds.The headphones are incredibly light-feeling on your head and the ear pads are soft and very, very comfortable.  The long cord is absolutely no problem and looks and feels substantive, unlike some other cheap, very thin cords. They are excellent at outside sound dampening.  I researched so many headphones for hours and bought a pair of JVC HAV-570 "Super Bass" headphones. Admittedly, they were only $13, but they had many of the same specs as the X500's, i.e., 40mm drivers, etc, but the sound on the X500'S is literally five times better, and this saying a lot, because I was mildly satisfied with the cheaper pair (which got four stars overall on Amazon).  However, wanting more, I purchased a pair of Audio-Technica ATH-M30 Professional Headphones through Amazon for $40. They lacked range and were tight and felt smothering when worn. They don't come close to the JVC X500 in sound quality. I returned them and was going to settle for the other JVC's until I saw these on Amazon).I am not an expert at describing what makes for high sound quality but I know that when someone says, when describing headphones, that they hear parts of songs they couldn't previously hear well with other headphones, that means something, if accurate.  That description is absolutely true with these headphones.  It's not so much you will hear sounds that you never heard at all, it is that you will hear instrumental parts and vocals (such as some back up vocals), much clearer and stronger than you hear them with other headphones. I must re-emphasize that the sound from these headphones is incredibly rich and full, especially if your system has a graphic equalizer that you can admust to your particular likes.  You cannot go wrong with these headphones!!  I am almost in disbelief that they cost only $18, seem solidly made, are extremely comfortable and the sound will impress you to no end. They are heaven!
they are great
Alright buckle up boys. These are for people looking for a certain sound, specifically something laid back.Key points:- they love power. If you have an dac/amp they‚Äôll sound the best. But they work fine on a phone. I have an iPhone X, they get plenty loud but an amp does give that delicious lil ompf to it.- very lightweight, comfortable in my opinion.-mostly bass and mids, very laid back highs.You can‚Äôt go wrong for under $25. Just don‚Äôt expect to be blown away. They‚Äôre great value. I have all the big boy toys, the sennheisers, the audiotechnicas, v-moda, Sony, and even beats to mention a few. But these, are honestly one of my favorite. They‚Äôre laid back. Enough detail to be happy with. The highs aren‚Äôt sharp. In fact the frequency range graph has a big dip around 4-5k hz. They‚Äôre not harsh. These are for when you want to literally just listen to music and chill out. They‚Äôre great for gaming, they have great sound stage and plenty of bass to back it up and mids to hear what‚Äôs going on around you. They‚Äôre absolutely perfect for rock music. Especially metal.Good for movies. Turn up and they‚Äôll vibrate nice on your head from the bass.The sound is veiled, if even muddy but, it‚Äôs good. Really good. I‚Äôd be happy to pay $80 for these, so you can‚Äôt really go wrong with them.Long cable, 8.2 feet. It‚Äôs attached but it‚Äôs also a sub $50 headphone so you can‚Äôt complain. The plug is quite the thick boy so you‚Äôre not really gonna be able to fit it in a phone case, a iPhone dongle won‚Äôt be an issue though.These are more of a home headphone. Not specially for travel. If you‚Äôre looking to work out in these or block out a ton of sound, look elsewhere. Good for public trans or walking just so you can hear the world going on around you while listening to music, btw if you have a problem with headphones losing bass while you‚Äôre out and about, these won‚Äôt do that.I‚Äôve heard probably a hundred headphones and thousands of dollars of equipment, but these will always be one of my favorites.

I received this item as a same day purchase.  Amazing that I ordered it at 10:00 am and it was here by 4:00.  Pretty incredible!  The pedal is made of top-notch material and has the weight as to not move around when using.  The pedal also has that "authentic" feel to a Grand Piano.  If I close my eyes, I cannot tell the difference.  This is a keyboard must have as the pedal received with the P125 is not very good, slipping and sliding making it unusable unless you're on a rug.  I would back this claim 100%!
Nice material, weighted just well enough to stay put.  From an amateur, this seems to work nicely.Plus its validating to learn a tune without the pedal and then add it after you've practiced it a bit! Glad I bought it early on to practice good mechanics from the start and build that muscle memory that takes some getting used to.
My Yamaha P71 (P45) 88 Key Keyboard came with a sustain pedal but the included one is very light and doesn't have the feel nor the half pedal ability of the M-Audio SP-2 or the weight which helps to keep it from moving around.  I bought it at the same time I purchased the keyboard and it's reasonably priced and a "required" accessory for an intermediate player and possibly a beginner.
easy to use
I use this as a foot switch on my amateur radio equipment.  Has the ability to be used as a push to close or push to open contact switch.  Well made and works great
Got this sustain pedal to replace the flimsy one that came with my keyboard and never stayed in place.  This one doesn't move around on the carpet and was a good price.  I would recommend.
I like this, but when I first plugged it in, the sustain was on without stepping on the pedal. I was like, "WTH?" and when I looked on the bottom, there was a recessed area with a switch, so I slid it to the other side. Easy peasy. I don't think I would reverse it again, but I guess some people like doing that for whatever reason. A good product.
Yay! It works with my Yamaha digital piano. I am so happy.
Bought this one again. It's quality compared to many others. It's a little more expensive than many others, but worth the longevity.
A great pedal. Solid components. Solid weight & balance. Stays put. Works as advertised. I purchased it after a musician-friend loaned me a Korg keyboard (I will buy it from him ultimately I suppose). I use it as a dedicated sustain-pedal. It‚Äôs sweet. Nothing more, nothing less. Would purchase again if needed. Thanks.

Updated Review #5 3/12/2022Still great! No issues whatsoever. Price is currently $129, I'd do it at that price. No disconnections. Noise cancellation makes my window fan almost silent while not noticeably affecting sound quality. Can't hear the roommates. I'm in my own world with these on.I use these for watching videos on a PC where I can EQ and raise the volume more than someone with a phone. I use them on my phone too, but my audio player has a way to boost the sound so that I can play them extra loud if I want to.Updated Review #4 11/10/2021Still working great after almost a year now, still comfortable. Still 5 stars. I use them every night for several hours. Still holds a long charge.Updated Review #3 5/27/2021Still working great, I love these things. Paid a little less than $100. Holds a charge great. Never drops the signal. Ever. I use them every night to watch movies and they're fantastic.I am no longer bothered by the ear cups no matter how I wear them. Maybe they softened up a little. These are bad ass!Updated Review #2 1/29/2021Okay I got these headphones to fit comfortably. I hope I can explain this. Back to 5-stars.I put the headphones on, then I swivel the cups forward, like putting more pressure near my temple (front of the ear), and less pressure on the back part of the ear (that sticks out from my head).The mistake is trying to fit them evenly over my ear, or flat against my head. At least for me. The cups are simply too small (they should be bigger!). Making this adjustment makes them fine for hours. I have no discomfort and the sound quality is not changed at all.I still think the narrow ear design is flawed (I believe I said "stupid" earlier), but the sound quality and price I paid keep these at 5 stars.And I repeat, for better and louder sound on a PC, I recommend the FREE "Equalizer APO". It EQ's all sounds coming from your computer to the headphones and speakers. Also download another free program called "Peace" to control the EQ easier. Way easier.Updated Review 1/19/2021These are uncomfortable after prolonged use. I can watch a movie, but after that it is sometimes a bit painful. The ear pads are poorly designed and I am looking to replace them. They are too narrow, I really don't understand why they were designed this way.Just looking at them tells you they are not made to fit over the ear of a human being. I just don't see how you can screw up that part of a headphone design. It's dumb.I paid $99 for these less than two months ago, now they are $146. If I'd paid $146 I would definitely return them, but for the price I paid I'm hoping I can find better ear pads instead. They sound great and I like everything else about them.I also may have found a way of positioning them so that they are more comfortable, but seriously why should I have to? I shouldn't even know I'm wearing them after a few minutes. What a stupid design.-------------------------This is my first pair of wireless headphones and I am very happy with them.They sound so much better than the cheap wired ones I usually get, and I used to think they were pretty good! I didn't know what I was missing before. Now I can re-watch some movies with incredible sound!I can see why some people will find the ear cup padding uncomfortable. I may end up replacing them, but if I adjust them over my ears right then I really don't have any problems. They could be a little wider though and I do have to move them a little sometimes. This is the only issue that could remove a star from my review, but like I said, so far I'm fine with it so all stars are intact.The sound is very clear and they do a good job covering the entire frequency range. I use Equalizer APO for my Windows machine, so whatever I run through the speakers or headphones is custom EQd. That makes a giant difference!The battery life kicks butt! They last so long I forget to recharge them. it's just not something I have to do very often :)For the first few weeks I could hit the center of the volume "rocker" button and it would tell me how much battery life I had left. I can't get that to work anymore. No biggie though. It will warn me if there is less than 12 hours left anyways when I turn them on.The noise cancellation works well. But really the full cup nature of these headphones deal with most noise without the need of electronics. If I wear these with no sound playing I can't hear much in the way of noise.I could do without the button that handles the track skipping and pausing. I sometimes hit it instead of the volume by mistake and my movie starts over from the beginning. I use a mouse for that stuff so I don't need it. I just take an extra moment to make sure I don't do that. Maybe I can put some tape over it. A lot of people like this feature so I'm probably in the minority.I paid about $99 for these and I am very happy. They could be louder on the phone though, but my music app has a volume boost that I can use. On the PC I can make them as loud as I want.I love not tripping over the wire of my old headphones anymore, or rolling over the wire with my chair. Such an annoyance! Wireless is awesome!The sound quality is very good. Wireless headphones downsample the audio before streaming to your ears, but with these I can't tell. They are also HD in that regard - they transmit a higher quality sound. And if you're really picky you can plug them in with the cord and get full sound. I can't tell the difference.I had to buy a Bluetooth adapter so I got one here at Amazon. get Bluetooth 5! I had an issue getting all this to work, but once I figured it out they work great.I did a ton of research before buying these. I look forward to watching movies and listening to music more now. I highly recommend them, they are awesome!
The sennheiser HD450 BT is the successor to the 4.50. it's an improvement in every way.Comfort.The 450 BT has a thin headband but it never dug into my head at all. This is all plastic but it's well constructed and folds to a very compact size. The one thing i wish is that the earcups were a smidge wider, but i can think of a number of people i know and who i had try these headphones on, of varrying builds and none of them felt comfort was an issue. Truthfully it isn't anything i can't live with and i am nitpicking, but also comparing to other headphones i own.The headphones charge via USB-C and also have an analog cable with a 2.5 MM plug for the headphones, and a 3.5 MM for your headphone jack.The codecs they support are SBC, AAC, APTX and APTX-LL. The latter is designed to sync the audio from a TV or movie with what you see on screen.Note; IPHONES AND IPADS DO NOT SUPPORT THIS FEATURE.noise canceling. The headphones do well illiminating the whirring from AC units, busses etc, but with Air Conditioners for example, you'll still hear the fan noise, though it will be reduced. These also don't block voices very well, though they passively block them out enough so that with music playing at low-medium volumes and higher of course, you likely won't hear any of these noises well. There are headphones that cost double who's ANC is not as good as the Sennheiser HD450 BT.Sound. You can customize the sound via the Sennheiser Smart Control app, available on IOS and Android, via a dot EQ. The eq implementation is 2 stars only because i am able to get a sound i enjoy with these and other Sennheiser products i have which also use the Smart Control app, but from a programming and customization standpoint, it earns a solid half a star.By default the sound has an emphasis on bass in all it's forms, but these are not muddy by any means. The mids are full and the treble is rolled off slightly, but fortunately all this can be refined to some degree with the eq. Theres still a veil to the sound if i compare them to higher priced models like the NAD Viso HP70 or Shure Aonic 50, but those cost twice as much as the $200 MSRP Sennheiser placed on these. that said, these have some real potential and if you use an app that has a multiband eq, you could really make these shine. AS is, they have a good sense of space for instruments to have separation and sounds in tv shows to have their place as well.Functionality.The Sennheiser 450 BT uses buttons for it's functions.on the underside of the left side of the headphone just above the earcup, there is a braille L to indicate left. The right earcup is where all the buttons and ports are.you have the analog adapter mentioned earlier, the USB-C port, on the bottom edge of the right earcup. The volume button has a dot on one end, that's volume up. the other side closest to you while wearing them is volume down. Details like this help when you want to use them without looking, especially because while the buttons aren't hard to use, they are a little cramped in some instances. Fortunately they're distinct enough that it shouldn't be hard memorizing each one and what it does. Back to the layout, the next button over from volume moving towards your ear while you're wearing them is a toggle which rewinds and fastforwards by flicking it it up for fast forward, and down for rewind. Fun fact, if you hold the toggle in either direction, you can scrub through the track bit by bit. perfect if you miss something while listening to a podcast or audiobook. some devices and apps don't support this functionality however. pressing inward on the toggle pauses or plays music and also answers and ends calls. next button up, right near where the headphone band connects to the earcup is an assistent button. This worked 100% of the time. I didn't need to set it up like i have to with some products. This is using google Assistent. on the opposite side of the right earcup from the assistent button is the power/noise cancelation button. You press and release to turn ANC on and off and hold for 2-3 seconds to power on and off. Hold for 5 seconds to place in pairing mode.These also support multipoint connection, so you can have them connected to a tablet for music and a phone for calls for example. If you have music playing on one device, and recieve a call on another device the headphones are paired to, the music will pause, and the call will come in. you can hold the function button for a couple of seconds to reject the call. IF you do, your audio from the previous device will start playing again.Call quality. While these headphones don't have a transparency mode available while listening to music etc, they do use it for phone calls. This is a wonderful feature because you can clearly hear yourself and your environment while on a call. Vital while you're walking or might otherwise be occupied. The callers i spoke with in most cases didn't know beforehand i was using headphones for the call. And they never ask me to repeat myself or if i were on bluetooth. while speaking with them i did every day tasks, washing dishes, talking with my birds, vacuuming etc. The people i did ask for feedback on how i sounded said they could hear these noises in the background, but the sounds didn't overpower my voice and they could always hear me clearly. I left my phone in a room most the time while i wandered through my apartment and it never cut out on the call or while listening to music.These are a fantastic buy. If you want a well built headphone that has a lot of features but doesn't have a premium price, this is the one to get right now.
This is my one day review of the 450s, I will update it one week, month, and possibly further.One week review is in the middle, and the long term review is at the very bottom. \/  \/Pros*The biggest thing that these headphones have going for them is their sound. I am by no means an expert on audio equipment, but I know good sound when I hear it. These headphones are amazing in the sound department, now they're not the he1s, but if you buy them on sale, they're one of if not the best sounding headphones for the price that are Bluetooth. Heck, it even makes ads sound good.*I believe there's an actual mini tweeter along with the main driver that helps with a bit of separation.*The headset has active noise cancelation (anc). The anc could be a bit better, but it does an okay job.*They come in white. XD*They have the ability to be a hard wired headset, so if you wanted to, you could plug them directly in. They also automatically turn off when you plug the 3.5mm jack in. The 3.5 plug also locks in so you don't accidentally pull it out of the headphones.*They use USB c to charge, this means one less cable to have just laying around.*The entire headset is made out of plastic, but it's a very durable and good feeling plastic.*I've seen some reviews about how the earpads heat up a lot for them, but these have stayed relatively cool, and haven't held a lot of heat.Cons(Disclaimer: these may not apply to everyone that buys these.)*The earpads are very cramped and not meant for people with medium to large ears. You can buy aftermarket earpads from brainwavez and some other brands that can fix this issue. I might order some in the coming weeks.*The connection via aux is secondary and Sennheiser designed these headphones to be Bluetooth primarily. I was excited to see that they had an aux cord included, but it just seems like they added it as an afterthought. I haven't gotten the mic to work through the aux cord yet.*The padding sucks everywhere, the headband that is on the headset only has minimal padding, and as mentioned before the earpads are also not the greatest for larger eared people. So these are borderline not wearable for the larger eared friends out there.*The app. Sennheiser, what were you thinking? People want customization in their sound and all you can do is change the bass, mids, and treble. I'd love it if there was a bit more customization in the eq. That said, these sound decent enough without an eq, so I'm just nitpicking here, so don't let the app hold you back from getting these.//Overall 1 Day Review\\They sound amazing, so get them if they are on sale, I wouldn't buy them if they go back up over $150. They have a lot of things that can be improved and I know they have the updated version (458s). If you're a smaller eared person, and/or are willing to deal with the little irritations here and there, these are an amazing set of headphones.//Overall one week review\\After some more research, these headphones do not support using the mic through the 3.5 mm. If you want to use these as conference call headphones, you will need to pair them via Bluetooth to your computer. Another thing I have found out is that the audio quality drops down significantly when using the microphone IF you have sidetone monitoring on.Another thing is that in my original review, I said the noise canceling wasn't that great, but I didn't really understand what the headphones, and the noise canceling were exactly doing. These headphones are great in the noise canceling department. SPECIFICALLY for listening to music. They won't drown out every single noise, but they get rid of quieter and more constant noises that would distract you from the music.Battery life on this is amazing. Even with the active noise canceling on, I hardly needed to charge them through the week. And because because they are USBC, they charge extremely quick.My biggest mark against these in my original review was the comfort. And I'm sad to say these still are not the most comfy headphones. They make my ears feel cramped and I can't spend a huge amount of time with these headphones on. They are bearable, but not the most comfy. Keep this in mind if you have medium to large ears.//Overall Long-term Review\\These headphones are great, if you're worried about them being too small, you'll get used to it. Not a great thing to say about a pair of headphones that certainly aren't cheap persay. They're okay on comfort, but you'll find yourself adjusting the earcups regularly to prevent fatigue on your ears. Sometimes I even have to take them off completely for a bit while my ears readjust.I'm willing to put up with the discomfort because of the sheer quality I get from these headphones. They're amazing for obviously being designed to be linked to mobile devices (phone, tablet, laptop, etc) they sound great over Bluetooth.So if you find yourself spending money on new $20 headphones every two months, just get these. You'll be blown away by the quality and never want to go back. They're very well built and should never let you down.
Pros:-The sound quality is really excellent. these are some of the best sounding headphones I've ever had. I've heard the fancy Sony WH-1000XM4's and I like the sound on these much better.-The noise cancelation is also very good. Maybe not as good as the Sony or Bose but still quite good.-The build quality is also very good. It's mostly plastic, but it feels pretty solid and I'm not worried it's gonna break. The ear cops also have a nice soft faux leather on them.-I saw some reviews that said that the layout of the control buttons was confusing, but I did not find that to be the case. Once I acclimated to it, it was totally fine.-It paired to my phone and laptop very easily.-The battery also last a long time. I  use these everyday for my commute and I can go over a week between charges.-They fold up very nicely for storage.Cons:-The ear cups are small and will not fit completely over your ears unless you have the smallest ears in the world. I've tried on other over the ear headphones that had alot more space for your ears. These will sit on your ears and that can be quite uncomfortable.-The headband has very little padding and it can hurt the top of your head .-The side tone(which pipes in ambient noise so you can hear your surroundings) is annoying. When you are listening on your phone, you can turn it off though the app. But I have not figured out how to turn it off when I pair with my laptop, so these headphones are super annoying to use for zoom meetings on my laptop for work.-When you are connected to two devices via Bluetooth and then turn one of them off or go out of range, you get an annoying "disconnected" message that repeats over and over until you turn them off and restart.-If you want to connect them to a device via a wire you need a specific cord, you can't just use any 3.5mm cord.-Although you can move the ear cups around a little bit, they cannot fol flat. This means that if you take the headphones off your head and are wearing them around your neck, the ear cups stick up and hit you in the chin, which is annoying.Overall: These are my first over-ear headphones. I usually prefer on-ears, but it seems that many companies seem to be phasing out the on-ears in favor of over the ears so the on-ears are harder to find. Also the sound quality in over-ears is supposed to be better. But I have to say that after trying these for about 6 months I am giving up on them and am going to go back to on ears. I love the sound, but they are just too uncomfortable for me and hurt my ears and head after about an hour. Also, I wear glasses and the over-ears press against the ear pieces, which is very uncomfortabke. I really wanted to love these because they sound so good, but the discomfort is just not worth it.
The Headset HD 450 BT Holds well to the head without being too tight or loose. This headset has not fallen off of my head by sudden head movements.I use this for my PC and when I'm gaming the multi directional sound allows for most games to be played comfortably and the sound quality plays well with music having decent base and a wide range of audio. When On PC Best used with a background filter such as Krisp or NVIDIA broadcaster. These headphones can cause you to hear yourself! Just turn input down. Can be used for gaming, calls and music comfortablyThe casing  feels solid and is still bendable without straining itThe sound dampening is much better then expected whether from construction (we had some work done in our house) or from software it does a good job at blocking out background sounds.Battery life is VERY GOOD and I really wish I can put that on bold letters! Holds charge for a long time and when depleted can recharge very quickly for use in just a few minutes.
they‚Äôre great and i love them however if you like to listen to your music even remotely loud other people will definitely be able to hear it clearly too. the controls take a little to get used to but they‚Äôre pretty comfortable (i know other people say they‚Äôre not comfortable but i have pretty small ears) and look great, they have a long battery life and sound great other than people being able to hear it from outside of the headphones there are no major issues.
I‚Äôve owned at least 5 pairs of different headphones and this is the best one yet. Noise cancellation & sound quality are subpar. I ran on a busy street and barely heard any of the cars. I ran 10 miles in a forest and only heard my music like a surround system. My headphones stayed on the whole 10 miles and I didn‚Äôt have to fix its position once! Every note is heard clearly and I can experience the mood my music is supposed to elicit. I‚Äôm in love w these and couldn‚Äôt be happier w my purchase.
1st the product is worth $100.00 - 2nd these are not that great using talking on the phone. However if you have a decent cellphone with enhanced audio features. You'll experience crisp highs and midrange, my favorite feature is bass responds. No these aren't you $500+ headphones. Yet for those of us too cheap or broke to pay for the high-end. You'll enjoy good sound quality in a affordable price range. I listen to house music/EDM and old school hiphop. Durning my daily walks so I highly recommend you pickup a pair & pump up the jam...
First and foremost I want to start off by saying that I don't understand why so many people are saying that these headphones don't fit over the ears properly! I have fairly large ears and my ears fit inside the cups. These headphones are very comfortable and they sound fantastic. I have been using Sennheiser products for many many moons now and I was very skeptical about buying these headphones after reading some very odd reviews (none of which are true). Here's the long and skinny of these headphones. The build quility is VERY GOOD, The Sound is VERY GOOD, the Noise Cancellation is okay, but not great. Just to give you a reference to what I am comparing them to. Previously before these, I owned the Sony XB 900s and I absolutely LOVED those headphones. Unfortuanetely the movers who moved me into my new house loved them too and they stole them from me =(. The noise cancellation on the Sony's is definitely more noticable and just better, but I do think that these headphones have a more accurate sound. HENSE the word ACCURATE! The Sony's sounded Awesome, but Sennheiser is known for there awesome accurate sounding headphones and these have that sound.Are they comfortable? Yes indeed they are. I can were these headphones for hours at a time and not get fatigued at all. I do think the Sony's were a little more comfortable and not as tight, but these aren't tight to the point where you have to take them off 10 minutes after putting them on.Now for the CONS: When you have the headphones on an you open up a music player or open any app really, you get an annoying speaker pop/click. I don't understand why, I have never had a pair of headphones that popped everytime you opened up an app or turned on or off the headphones. It's not loud and I don't want you to think that you are going to go deaf from this little speaker pop, it's harmless, but nonetheless annoying and a bad defect from an awesome company like Sennheiser. Also when I first put these headphones on for the very first time the sound sounded very narrow, like the sorround sound was turned off. The Sony's definetly had a more spacious sound. The more you listen to the Sennheisers, the better they sound and you will fall in love with the Amazing Sound!Bottom Line: These headphones are VERY GOOD Sounding headphones. If you just want awesome sound, these will not dissapoint! I have actually heard things in music that I have never heard before, that's how accurate they are. Commfort is like a 4 out of 5, maybe 3 1/2. I have never owned a pair of Bose headphones, so I am guessing that they are about as comfortable is they come. I don't want to mislead on comfortability, because I am sure there are headpones out there that feel like the "My Pillow" on your ears. Again nonetheless, these headphones are comfortable.
Bought them and found that as some other reviews said they were just not comfortable for me. The ear openings are far too small which is surprising as Sennheiser has always put ample openings in their headphones.I returned them and purchased the wired HD599's which have a superior sound stage and are super comfortable.

I bought these for my grand son for school , they didn‚Äôt have enough headphones for all the kids however he loves them
They work great for my granddaughter
I don't know if it's the product's fault, but my 6-yr old son broke it the first week at school. I replaced it with another brand I found an Amazon and that one has survived just fine.
One little plastic peace already broke.
Don't expect good sound quality but the kids won't care and they work
I have bought this for son and daughter for school. My sons broke within the first week. Thought it was a fluke so got a replacement. Now my daughters broke in same place. Little upset especially since I just missed return date
Perfect for the little ones .. daddy don't have to here pa,pa pig anymore ... lol
Got these for my three year old we like them so far ! Def worth the price
Headphones broke after a week and only a couple uses
These were perfect for my 3 year old on the airplane

Giving this item 3 stars because the color itself is so pretty but I just opened the box and the headphones already had an area where it was peeling. I was really hoping these headphones were the ones but I guess they weren‚Äôt meant to be.
correcto el funcionamiento, lo √∫nico malo es las almohadillas se sienten como si se fueran a hacer pedazos, ya hab√≠a comprado unos en color cobre y vinieron bien, solo que estos negros me llegaron as√≠.
I use this headphone for listening to TV and movies via my Apple TV as well as through my iPhone via Bluetooth.  I haven't experienced any latency issues syncing with voice on the TV.  The sound quality is right in my wheelhouse, bright sound without being tiring, the bass is strong without being overpowering and it's able to reproduce seriously low frequencies.  Music, movies, games and TV are all really great through these cans.  I am a fan of Koss Porta-Pro and these cans have a similar sound to them, albeit without the wide open sound of the Porta-Pros.There is an issue I have experienced a couple of times with the headset appearing to be off, but it remains connected to the source device while appearing to be turned off.  The fix is quite easy, just plug them into the charger for a couple of seconds, which forces the headphones to power down completely, then I turn them back on and all is well.I have read a couple of reviews that complained about poor fitting, and I'm pretty sure I've figured out the issue... they're on backwards.  I had the same response initially, since all of my other Bluetooth cans have the controls on the left, I put them on that way and finally figured out the controls go on the right ear and the fit becomes perfect, no pressure points and very comfortable padding.These are not noise cancelling phones, but they do a little bit of sound isolation due to their closed-back nature, but don't expect a whole lot of isolation.Money well spent.
I like that I can pretty much use these all day before I get a battery warning.  They are comfortable for the most part.  They don't fit over my ears quite as well as I had hoped to compete with a wired set of headphones I have, but they are far better than the other set of wireless that I have and there are no wires to get in the way after a while.  I would like the volume buttons to be a bit easier to find.  I keep mashing a sound button changing modes when I want to turn the volume up.  At the end of the day they do what they're supposed to, and they do it well.  The shipper wasted no time that I can recall getting the product out to me.
Sound quality and noise cancelling are good especially considering the price.Battery life is great.Only downsides are the button placement and spacing is not ergonomic and the fake leather, or vinyl, coating started cracking and flaking after a couple days.Overall, I think great value for the price.
Honestly, this headphone aren‚Äôt bad but I wished I just made the investment in a better headphone‚Ä¶sound quality isn‚Äôt terrible‚Ä¶no noise cancellation available for this model‚Ä¶not foldable‚Ä¶sound options are trash‚Ä¶highs aren‚Äôt that good mids and lows are alright‚Ä¶headphone wouldn‚Äôt turn off on two occasions so I had to plug it in and for some reason it turned off by itself and all is well again‚Ä¶the system gets a little glitchy sometimes‚Ä¶nice cheap option but honestly an extra 20 could get u a better headphone with real noise cancellation from Sony and a better build quality‚Ä¶u won‚Äôt regret investing in a more premium headphone‚Ä¶fake leather is stripping already‚Ä¶I had these headphones for less that a month and it looks like I had them for like a 1 year+
Sound is decent for the cost.  Battery life is good.  But the soft leather-like covering is horrible!  Removing the headphones from the package tore the inner left and right padding because both sides were stuck to the molded plastic packaging. After using the headphones lightly, I noticed another rip on them.  I have other headphones from Panasonic and no problems with them at all.  May be a bad batch?
The sound quality is great but the material on the fabric isnt the best.
Sound is great but my product has started to show wear and tear after just a little use. I would like a refund please.
So, these headphones are extremely comfortable,(If you use them outside, I'd suggest you get mesh or fabric earpads because they get hot) heavy bass, not the best battery life but they come with a headphone jack so, I'm not complaining. There is a 30ms delay so they are great for videos and movies, don't Max out the volume because they get loud. Overall, these are good headphones on a budget.

Used this for almost two years now I'm a call center work from home. I'm not sure what others are doing to their headsets causing them to break. Mine look brand new and use them 40 hours a week. Good product and I would buy again once this one dies out as all technology does over time.
I have debating buying these headphones. I‚Äôve been on the fence and finally got a great deal for these headphones. Fit and feel are great! Sound quality is good again these are not high end but they sound really good! I compare them to my beats and Sony headphones and I love this set best! They are compact and fold up like it‚Äôs competition not to mention I luv Wyze products! $60 deal don‚Äôt miss out and my teenage son is very happy! He doesn‚Äôt use his beats anymore. I will have get my own set now.
I bought these to replace my MPOW-059 headphones I‚Äôve had for about two years. The only reason being because the cloth on the head strap of the MPOW headphones has started to peel off revealing the foam cushion underneath. Otherwise those headphones still work great and I still use them as backups.These have the exact same features as the MPOW-059‚Äôs but with a few extra perks as some others have noted. Namely the pairing is easier and also, unlike with the MPOWs when paired to a second device will also automatically pair to that second device (when on) as well as the first paired. With the MPOWs you had to connect manually to the second device every time (not pairing every time but connecting). Kind of a hassle so I just ended up using them for one device. But these will connect automatically to two once paired the first time.  Note though, these do not mix audio sources. (You can‚Äôt play two devices simultaneously). I don‚Äôt believe the MPOWs do either but I never really tried to be honest.These are more comfortable on the head/ears, especially when lying down on your side. The MPOWs kind of pinched my lower ear if I was using them in bed but these don‚Äôt.  Also, they charge much more quickly than the MPOW's, in about an hour where the MPOW's can take 4-5 hours to reach a full charge.Also these have a brilliant feature that it will automatically pause whatever you are watching/listening to, if you just take them off your head. The MPOWs never did that. Also, another lovely feature is that if you just cup your hand over the right earphone, it mutes the sound (and noise cancellation) so you can hear what someone may be trying to say to you without removing the headphones. It‚Äôs a neat little feature but I‚Äôve just been taking the headphones off in such a case.Speaking of the noise cancellation it is quite effective muting background noise/sound at least 50%, really more in normal ambient noise level conditions.  To give you and idea of the level of cancellation,  I haven‚Äôt tried them on a plane yet but we live near some railroad tracks and normally I can hear a train go by if not wearing these. If wearing, the train noise is muted completely.The volume controls work very well and it also does indeed have an actual internal microphone in the headphones I can confirm. (When I was shopping I couldn‚Äôt be 100% sure but I can say that with certainty now). The MPOWs don‚Äôt and I was disappointed for that reason after I bought them. People say I sound very clear when on a call or in a virtual meeting (like on Teams) so if you want these for that reason definitely get them. I‚Äôm not sure how well they block background noise for those in the call (those hearing you). Apparently they are supposed to do that but of course I can‚Äôt tell how well others hear any background noise. They say they don‚Äôt but could be just polite etc. who knows. They say they can hear me well though so I think that‚Äôs sufficient.So I give 5 stars for everything BUT the sound quality to which I give 4 stars. Really I‚Äôd give it 4.5 if I could. Only because, to my untrained, non-audiophile ears, there does seem to be a SLIGHT reduction in range (the bass) compared to the MPOW-059 especially when gaming. When I say ‚Äúslight‚Äù though I mean slight it‚Äôs really not worth it to pass up these in favor of the MPOWs (or other similar price point headphones) for this reason alone.  Unless you are super demanding for audio in that case I‚Äôd recommend going up another range of cost.  Admittedly I haven't used the companion app in which, apparently, one can adjust the sound, so there's that caveat.Really I think these are a better buy than the MPOW-059, if only slightly. Mainly for the comfort and the internal mic. And in my opinion you can‚Äôt do better than these or the MPOWs at this price point.
I have had the WYZE Bluetooth 5.0 Headphone for almost a two months. I have it connected to my Smart TV because I do not want to wake up my new born when he is sleeping with the loud tv noise. It will do the job and I recommend the purchase.
They sound good for the price, they lack some clarity and separation, but no complaints, the price is great.The noise cancelling is very effective, I take mine to the gym, where it's very loud and they block out a lot of the noise. They are also comfortable, the ear pads are very soft, maybe if they were a little deeper they would be perfect.I would recommend these to anyone looking for some good quality noise cancelling headphones and don't want to spend a ridiculous amount.
These headphones are really good for the price. The unadjusted sound quality is ok, but it‚Äôs a bit muddy on the low end and flat on the high. The EQ can fix that really quick. I just set up a custom preset and they are fine.The ear cups are comfortable for extended wear, but they are a bit warm. They are not removable, so when the cups go bad you‚Äôll need to buy a new pair of headphones. Still, at this price that‚Äôs still cheaper than most higher end headphones.The draw string pouch they come with is ok and it has areas for the two included cables (pin-to-pin and USB-C to A). However the pouch isn‚Äôt quite big enough to fit the headphones and close completely around them.** Update: A friend got a pair of these and his bag fits the headphones. It appears mine is just defective.The noise canceling isn‚Äôt quite as good as AirPods Pro and Max, but it does a pretty good job. I also appreciate the Transparency mode when you need to hear things around you.The physical controls are ok, but I do wish the buttons were larger and a bit more distinct. I also miss touch controls. You can place a hand over the right earcup (and only that one) to cut the audio and turn on Transparency mode. It‚Äôs a good feature, but the cup isn‚Äôt touch sensitive. My understanding is that it uses a proximity sensor. Letting go of the cup returns the audio to whatever it was before you put your hand on the cup.If you use a bunch of Wyze products, you‚Äôll probably appreciate that it uses the Wyze app on your phone for firmware updates and the EQ. Without the app most features work, just not the EQ and no firmware updates. You can turn on and off noise canceling and transparency mode using buttons on the right cup, so most things work without the app.Battery life is good. They say you can get 20 hours out of a charge, which I‚Äôd say is pretty accurate. The battery is not end-user replaceable, though.A few other minor issues:*  The  battery level of the headphones can only be checked in the Wyze app.* The cables are far too short. They are perhaps a foot long. So while you can use these headphones with a standard headphone jack, you will probably want to buy a longer 3.5 mm pin-to-pin (male to male) cable.* You may also want a longer or different  charging cable and the headphones don‚Äôt come with a wall charger, though most USB-A chargers should work fine.* Since all controls are on the right ear cup, it‚Äôs not as nice for left-handed people to use.Still, even with these caveats, the headphones are great for the price. Well worth it for someone looking for an upgraded over-the-ear headphone experience without spending hundreds of dollars.
I'm not an audiophile, but for context my old Cowin E8 pros broke and I wanted an upgrade. I tested these against the following options - Bose QC 35i, Sony XM3 and XM4. The Bose and Sony were a tiny bit better on the noise cancelling, and I liked the style on the Sony's a bit better, but that's it, so they definitely weren't worth the extra $200 that they would have cost. The Wyze were actually better than the other options in terms of features (I think it has the best features from both the Sony and Bose options I tested), and comfort, and definitely value.Pros:- Very good noise cancelling - almost as good (maybe 95% as good) as the Sony/Bose near top of the line models- Great functional and practical features (two device bluetooth, buttons as well as touch controls, button to hear ambient noise as well as just cover the right ear cup to have a conversation, etc.)- Sound quality is good - I'm not an audiophile like I said, but I didn't note any issues- Microphone is really good - I work in my laundry/utility room in my basement currently (work from home, remodeling - one of the main reasons I wanted better noise cancelling headphones) - I've held calls with the dryer running right next to me and the person on the other side said they couldn't hear anything.- Unbeatable value - The higher priced models are just using their brand names to charge a ridiculous premium. This model has quality engineering at an unbeatable price.- Good comfort - the touch points are nicely padded. I preferred the larger/oval openings of the ear cups of the Bose and Sony's personally, but these are still comfortable and the headband on these is superior in comfort for wearing for longer periods/all day.Cons- Carry case is just a soft bag. It does have pockets for the included wires, but a hard case would be nicer - the Sony's had a really nice one. However, given the price point on these, I wouldn't really expect something better and the bag works/isn't low quality.- Occasionally I've had issues with sound cutting out on my computer when I'm connected to the computer and phone over bluetooth. It's sporadic but seems like turning the bluetooth connection on and off on my phone fixes it. A little annoying but the Sony and Bose also had their own annoying glitches, so it's not like it's a value issue (and may just be a user issue tbh).I really wanted to like the Sony's the most, but these were just too good of value and the Sony's had their own issues that just didn't justify their price. Returned the Sony's and stuck with these. I'd definitely recommend these if you're looking for max value and don't care about having a more recognized brand name on your headphones.
Pros---* Amazing sound quality* Great noise cancellation and easy to turn on / off* Great app features* Long battery* Super comfortableCons---* The adjustment of the head strap is too loose. I constantly have to readjust it* Better suction would make the noise cancelling perfect, I still hear some things with it on

I know little about various brands. I linked up with a good one here.

I like how cushiony they feel. They are soft on the ears even with my glasses on. The sound quality is terrific, with heavy base and clear, crisp sounds. They look great also. Very pleased.
This is my 4th pair of these!! I use them All the time... Excellent sound quality... I buy no other brand!!! I use them for talking on the phone, and listening to music hands-free.. buy you a pair you won't be disappointed disappointed!!
For the price there was nothing I did not like!Excellent to use as daily drivers and have that deep skullcandy audio feel. May not be a true audiophile experience but decent noise isolation and the cups fit me very well. (ears are a bit on the larger side but not large)Battery life is amazing and can go for a long time before needing a charge, also their fast charging claims are true and it does come in use.They fold well and do not take as much as well so you dont always have to carry them around your neck.They also look very clean, sleek and beautiful which many people do not talk about. No flashy or gaudy logos and just goes well with whatever you are wearingThe only issue with these is that they are full plastic and the build quality does not seem that sturdy. If you are someone who is very rough with their headphones then take careI got them on a discount so this does not matter as much to me.Overall decent value for the money and be wary of the build quality
I'm not an audiophile, and currently have one good headphones (AKG K701) that are not really portable and I use them mostly when working from home (sound leakage, open design). I am looking for polyvalent wireless headphones, mostly to listen while working 8h / day. Tried the Skullcandy Hesh 3 Wireless Headphone, Black (S6HTW-K033), the Sennheiser HD 4.40 Around Ear Bluetooth Wireless Headphones (HD 4.40 BT), the Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Case - Gold and the Bose QC35II. Did compare them on various musics, rock, pop, classic, ... .Bottom line: The only one I kept are the Hesh 3! Not for myself as I felt the comfort was not great (too tight / clamping pressure, burning ears after 1h listening), but for commute / smaller listening periods (i.e not full workday), they are great. Bluetooth is stable, sound quality is good. I'll keep looking for a comfy work-polyvalent headphones, probably give up the bluetooth criteria as I'm disappointed by the sound quality of the Sony & the Bose, and I'm not ready to put 350$ for 100$ audio quality level.Sound quality:Sony and the Bose are OK, but that's it, just OK, not great and not what I expect from 350$ headphones.Hesh3 have well defined bass (not too boomy, just what's needed to make it a fun headphones to listen to). Very good spatialization. Grabbed them at 80$ on black friday, and for my uneducated ears, they compare more to the Sony & the Bose than with my AKG K701 (not in the same category :-)). TBH, the sony & bose are a bit more clear than the Hesh3, but ... I feel the Hesh3 are more "fun" and would be my choice here.The clear looser here are the Sennheiser. They are disqualified from this review. Stay away from them, my 10y-old 15$ Koss are better. No spatialization, bad for rock, for pop, for classic... Might do for techno / podcasts.Build / comfort:Hesh 3 feels a bit plastic like at opening, but you quickly forget it. Comfort is so-so, you definitely feel them more than Sony & Bose. More clamping pressure, lower quality ear pads.Sony feels good and are probably the winner, I'm just a bit worried about the touch control thingy, what happens after the warranty expires ? Do you pay 200$ for repair if this stop working or bug ?Bose earpads feel less durable, BUT, they are the comfort winner. If you have money and want to buy a light, comfy headphones, go for it. Sony are the 2nd best in these models.Bluetooth:Hesh3: all good.Sony: I sent them back because... they kept jumping on my macbook. If I looked left or right, the sound will jump. If I walk 2 meter away from the laptop, it will jump. Worked good with my iPhone, but ... it's the only BT headphones I tried that was disqualified because of this. Not acceptable for this price range.Bose: did try them only 30min, but they seemed good.Sound leakage / isolation:Hesh3: no active noise cancellation, but cost 5 time less than the competition. I don't need that much noise cancellation and what they provide is enough to work in a open space, very little sound leakage.Sony / Bose: amazing. You put them on, and feel isolated from a lot of background noise. If you're looking for peaceful commute, they are worth it. The mic from the Sony did seems to pick less background noise in the few calls I tried.
My 21 yr old son is  gym rat. He's in the gym lifting weights and listening to loud music. This is probably the 10th pair of cordless headphones I've gotten him in the last few years. So far he's had these the longest, at least 6 months and he hasn't broken them either. Very simple to connect to your phone with great sound and range.
I have had these headphones for about a year now. I bought them in 2017 during a Black Friday sale for around $80 (worth full price of around $128 if necessary!).I was looking for a pair of headphones to wear primarily for the gym. I gave earbuds a chance again, but they have never worked for me and I decided to search for a pair of over the ear headphones.I started looking at Bose and Beats, but to me they both seemed to be overpriced and more hype than anything else. I had always heard of Skullcandy, but never actually tried them. That‚Äôs when I came across these Hesh3‚Äôs.I liked them at first because of the nice matte black finish without the noticeable logos plastered all over. In fact, you can only see the Skullcandy logo if you‚Äôre looking for it.I decided to give them a shot and could not be happier with my choice.The ear covers are plush and comfortable and another cushioned piece along the top of the head provides cushion as wel. These also help keep the headphones on your head during workouts such as bench press, etc. while you‚Äôre lying on your back yet they don‚Äôt squeeze your head and give you a headache.They seem to be holding up very nicely and every so often I will wipe them down with a baby wipe to keep them clean.I also use these for mowing the grass and when I‚Äôm doing things around the house like vacuuming, etc.I‚Äôd say the distance for the Bluetooth is approximately 30ft as advertised before the signal will begin to cut out. The Bluetooth always connects quickly and flawlessly to my iPhone as well.Battery life is amazing. Sometimes I will forget how long it has been since I‚Äôve even charged them. The quick charge feature is great too. I can plug them in for 5 minutes while I‚Äôm mixing a drink for the gym and I‚Äôll have a minimum of 2hrs of playback.Oh yea, the sound. They sound amazing! I listen in to a wide range of music styles from Five Dinger Death Punch to Drake and these handle everything with ease! While listening to Drake - Nonstop turned up the whole way the bass was actually vibrating the headphones, but it wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúboomy‚Äù bass as is usually described with beats headphones. These just sound awesome no matter what you throw at them. I also listen to podcasts and they work just fine for that as well.Another nice feature is being able to touch a button on the side of the headphones and answer your phone. I have even answered my phone with it 20 ft away from me and still was able to hold a conversation as if I was holding my phone.Buy these and you will not regret your decision. Keep making awesome products, Skullcandy!
I got these so I could concentrate at work and drown out the convos around me. The sound cancellation is great, the sound is awesome and I like that I can take phones calls on it and the other party hears me clearly
I make my headline seem like my headphones are completely destroyed, but they aren't. I purchased these knowing that they were fragile, but I insisted on telling myself that these are the best ones to get for the money. I bought a pair of Hesh 3 headphones from Skullcandy back in June of 2019. They were around the same price as they are now, 67ish dollars. I had recently worn down the usage of an old pair of headphones (which the name is currently escaping me) and I had decided that I wanted to buy a new pair. I had some specific qualities I wanted which included a price of under $100, bluetooth capability and an over-ear style headphone. That's when I came up on the Hesh 3 headphones. The reviews I saw were alright. The sound seemed good, loud and full of bass. The battery life was pretty long. And again, the price was only $67. A steal in my view. But the problem was the durability. It was always the durability that was the issue. I've seen multiple reviews saying that they had snapped theirs in half within the first two months. I didn't see that as an issue because I believed that I was capable of taking care of my headphones. I vowed that I will be careful and make sure that the probability of breaking these headphones kept to an absolute minimum. And, to be honest, that method actually worked. I took these and used these to a flight to and from Japan. I brought these to college. These headphones were always working just fine. That is, finally, up until just 1 hour ago. I had suffered the same fate as all of the other reviews, or will soon face it. The headband had cracked, exposing the wire that is run through it. It hasn't been snapped in half yet, but the fact the only required pressure to crack it was the small amount of pressure to slide it onto my head makes me believe that it's only a matter of time until these are unusable. Honestly, I'm not sure if I'm exaggerating, but I'm a little devastated. These headphones had worked magnificently with no issue for so long and to see that the unbroken streak is coming to an end makes me a little upset. I don't want to find a replacement, but I don't want to buy another pair of Hesh 3s, now that I know that their lifespan reaches to about a year and a half. It's just back to the research I go, looking for another pair of over-ear, bluetooth headphones with a price range of under $100.  I hope I can find something that works as well as these did for me but with a better build.
So let me start off by telling what I use these for.  I‚Äôm a finish carpenter and I wear these 5-6 days a week for at least 8 hours a day.  I work in dusty conditions and these these get banged around and dropped.  So keep that in mind just as I am as I write this review.  These headphones are wonderful and for around $70 they work great.  I bought them Nov. 24, 2018 and just this week (August 12THish) the battery seems to be going out.  I will throw them on the charger and the light turns green in about a minute saying they‚Äôre fully charged.  Go to use them and I get the low battery notification after about two hours.  It started that I could use them for at least two days without charging, even though I‚Äôd charge them in the car every day on my way home typically.  So the down side is that the battery is going out after 10 months but keep in mind they are run constantly every day almost for at least 8 hours.  I‚Äôve gotten my money out of them for sure, it would have been nice to see them last a bit longer.  The noise reduction; I don‚Äôt believe it said ‚Äúnoise cancelling‚Äù when I bough them and I was aware of that so I can‚Äôt beat them down on that.  I wear these for two purposes.  As a contractor I constantly get phone calls and these let me work and talk at the same time, and when I‚Äôm cutting something I like to put them on to muffle the noise.  They work, just not really noise cancelling.Overall, honestly these are fantastic headphones and they‚Äôve served me well.  There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôd ever drop $300 or more on headphones because they‚Äôre a fashion statement.  These work great, have great sound, are very comfortable, and considering the punishment I‚Äôve put them through they last a long time.  I‚Äôd highly recommend.  I just ordered the skull candy venue model which I‚Äôm excited to try and I‚Äôll write up on them after I‚Äôve used them a bit!
Bought these for my kids school work and play. They are reasonably priced, good quality, have proven rugged enough, and battery time good. When they break, cause they‚Äôre kids and they will break them, I will buy them again.

Cumple con mi nesecidad
El audio no es est√©reo y los sonidos no son muy claros o bien definidos
I love that these are over the ear so that they are great at noise canceling.
I decided to get this for my mom since she cannot have the ones that go inside the ears. The color is great and the material even better. For a 50yr old lady the sound is great she doesn't even use it all the way up. And noise cancelaion is great as well.
The product is good but the package was open and damaged.
It‚Äôs a great headphone, but the plastic is very thin and it is breaking easily even if it is in a case or you only using at home‚Ä¶
I love it,  I like the fact that I can plug it into the cardio equipment at the healthclub and listen to whatever tv station I want.  Or  I can listen to my music on my iphone which I would have to have with me (downside).  I used to have a great ipod shuffle - actually I have had three and each was stolen from me at the health club, so now I carry my iphone with me. Nonetheless, it is great
They sound amazing, life battery is perfect... it works wonderfully. But must be HANDLED WITH CARE. My headphones haven't broke... YET, but they are not as sturdy as they are made to look. For the price, I expected them to be better assembled, the materials more durable. Let's see how long they last.UPDATE: Didn't even last 6 months...
Excellent look, feel, functionality, weight and superb sound. My only complaint with these headphones is the actual build quality and materials used. They feel very cheap an lack durability. Like I said they are excellent headphones but if you buy them handle them like a fine China vase worth thousands lol.
Use them at the gym daily for about a month now.The battery has been real good. Use it about an hour daily and it dropped to 80% at the end of the week.They stay on pretty well no complaints.Sound is good bass is good.

Full disclosure: I purchased these headphones back in April 2021 and gave them some break-in time (until June 2021) before I reviewed them, so this is my experience of having them for more than 90 Days.I owned a pair of Beats Studio Wireless 2's for about 4 years, and they were a useable set of cans. They had some pretty smart wired connections, good battery life, and were rather comfy to wear... but their wireless connections were a nightmare, the integrated Mic awful, and the noise-canceling mediocre. I was looking for a change, and being a consumer of Apple Products and with the generally good reviews I had seen for the Airpod Max, I decided to take the (kind of) expensive plunge. And honestly, I was not disappointed.As with any good review, we'll break it down into the Pros & Cons and explore both.BUILD QUALITY/DESIGNPROS:The build quality on these headphones is nothing short of phenomenal. They are made of Metal and some nylon or rubber here and there (for the headband and earcup padding) and they feel VERY SOLID. The piston style adjustments on the headband always feel super tight and mechanical (still even months after using them). The earcups are always tight on my head, allowing the headphones to clamp down on my ears and prevent noise leakage. The Earcups are built out of what looks to be a rubberized polycarbonate and padded mesh fabric and are held in by MAGNETS, making them easy to replace if they get soiled or if you want a different color.Also, found out after the fact, the headband is ALSO replaceable if you want a different color later on down the line. The metal the speaker boxes are made from are the standard matte Apple aluminum, and the control buttons on the right speaker box are on par with the dials and buttons included on their Apple Watches (in fact, I'm pretty sure they're the same buttons, just "upsized" in the CAD program when making this device). It all feels very expensive and well built, and even 100+ days after initial use, still feels "brand new" and solid.CONS:Whereas I love the build quality, there are some pretty glaring design flaws and comfort issues that come along with this first outing from Apple.First, whereas the headphones still fit like they were brand new, I'd hope for some relief on the hard clamping aspect present in them. When I first wore them, I was finding the clamping done by the headphones very tight and threatening to give me a headache if I wore them too long since it was like a vise on my head. This has lessened slightly over time, but it is still very tight. I don't know of a fix for this outside of constant wear to try and get them to bend a flex to a less tight shape on my dome, but so far they still hurt a bit when wearing them for an extended time.Second, even though I like the good piston mechanics on the ear height adjustment with the headband since it takes some force to properly adjust them, sometimes you have to grip on the speaker boxes and pull downwards on them while pushing upwards on the headband with your cranium to get them to adjust to your liking. This wouldn't be an issue if the dial and button were on the bottom of the headphones, but since they're on the top of the right speaker box, it is notoriously difficult to adjust them on your head and not accidentally press one of the buttons, causing playback or the headphones to go into pair mode (which happens if you hold down the buttons for too long). You'd think, "oh, just grab the sides of the speaker boxes", which makes sense, however as I stated they are made of Apple's standard aluminum, and to add to that the edges are very rounded, so getting a grip on the side of the headphone speaker boxes is difficult at best.SOUNDPROS: The sound quality on these is an absolute beast, and it's by far the best pair of headphones I've ever used. The audio is clear, and you can hear highs, lows, and everything in between. However, I will be the first to admit, while I am musically inclined and love listening to audio, I'm by no means an Audiophile or claim to be able to hear what types of sounds are being emitted cleanly and loudly, and which aren't. I usually can if I have good reference, but as these are the best headphones I've ever owned, so they become the new baseline. Also, the built in noise canceling is the best in the business right now, and is definitely better than its closest competitor. The reason why it is so good is due to the multiple microphones established in the soundbox housing, which not only work EXTREMELY well for the ANC, but also for phone calls. The phone calls made from these headphones are nearly studio mic grade in how they sound, and are much better than most things included on computers or competitor headphones nowadays.CONS: Though I am not an audiophile, there is something that I can tell‚Äî when there is killer bass and when there isn't. And to my ears, these don't have a superheavy bass that will rattle your fillings, which is *fine*, but I thought there would simply be *more* bass in the audio. The bass may be enough for most music, and what it has is ok, but nothing akin to the huge bass I was *expecting*. The nice thing is that if you delve into the Accessibility Settings for your Apple product, you can set an audio profile for the headphones so it'll enhance the audio based on how well you hear (so already, this enhancement is *proprietary*; not a big deal for me as I own nothing but Apple devices, but YMMV).EASE OF USE/ACCESSORIESPROS: If using Apple products, the handoff of the headphones to the other devices works really, really well and hasn't needed to be paired more than once to each device it is used on. The pairing process is nicely simple if it does go wonky, and doesn't have nearly as many issues as other BT that gets locked into a single device. The equipment/accessories that it comes with are acceptable (charging lightning cable, bra-esque "case"). The stop/start/volume dial is very responsive and easy to click using the same click sequence that Airpod Pros have used for a while (Double click to advance, triple-click to go back, quad click, etc...). If you take them off your head, the headphones have a similar light sensor that other Airpods have to determine if they're in your ears or not, and will halt the music accordingly or start playing if they recognize they're back in place on your head. The lightning cable to charge the headphones is embedded in the base of the right-hand speaker box, and charges using the same style cable that your iPhone and old Airpods do, so you should already have at least one cable for it if you own Apple products.CONS: Hooo boy, ok. So with any early adopter technology, there's always going to be some bugs that need working out, or some design flaw that (where not crippling) makes the headphones more of a chore and less fun to use. This may be our longest section, but please take these with a grain of salt‚Äî none of these are dealbreakers for *me*, but since I'm not you, YMMV. Here are the issues I found in no particular order, but NEED to be discussed as I've often seen them glossed over elsewhere‚Äî- Analogue Connection. There is no direct analogue connection with these headphones. As most audiophioles claim, digital (especially wireless digital) will never be an acceptable connection replacement for analogue. And most high-grade cans have some sort of analog 3.5mm jack that can be plugged into a normal headphone port that will allow you to use these headphones with devices that don't transmit via BT, like a Record Player, or high-end sound system. The Airpods Max unfortunately have no such analogue connection. "But!" you may exclaim, "You can always use the Lightning port and plugin a Lightning to 3.5mm converter cable!" This is true... to an extent. First off, to get that feature to work, you need to get a SPECIFIC cable‚Äî Apple's Lighting to 3.5mm cable. The reason? Because that cable, and seemingly ONLY that cable, is BI-DIRECTIONAL. This means that no matter what end you plug your source into, that cable will translate the audio both ways. Most to all third-party cables (that I was able to find in my research) are like an annoying 13-year-old listening to music in 2011: all they play is ONE DIRECTION. Also, to top off the annoyance, when you DO use the Apple Cable, it takes the analogue source, transfers it to the headphones, whose signal is then converted to digital. Automatically, mandatorily, every time. This may be a problem for some people who demand their Analogue output to be heard in its original analogue glory. Also, the Apple cable that you HAVE to use is super cheap feeling and thin, instead of the normal thick or braided casing most headphone cables use. Did I mention that Apple also DOES NOT include this cable with the headphones? It's extra. Like about $30-$40 extra. So you may be better off with another set of headphones if you want a good, wired, analogue signal.- The "Case". I feel like the case that is included with these headphones will go down in history alongside the 1998  iMac USB Puck mouse, the Apple Newton, and the Magic Mouse Lightning port as one of their more GLORIOUSLY STUPID design decisions. The "case" is made of what I can assume is leather, but for a set of ~$550 headphones, that's about the only "premium" feature they boast. There is minimal padding. There supposedly is a magnet included in the area where the headphone edges touch that triggers an internal reed switch to put the cans in standby mode. Half the "case" is exposed to the elements and doesn't fully cover the electronics, so it isn't ideal as something to protect from inclement weather. And lastly, and most egregious, is that there is no way to use the case to carry around the headphones or attach them to anything‚Äî no belt clip or loop, no hanging clip, nothing. So believe me when I say that you're gonna need a case for these things if they're ever gonna leave your home, and it's almost imperative if you live in a place with inclement weather. I bought a full zip case that has a built-in magnet for the reed switch, has a few pockets for cables, and is very padded. It was worth the cost to make sure that my headphones that cost *half a thousand dollars* stay safe. Apple's lack of protection has not only garnered users' ire, but made the Airpod Max case into little more than a joke, and I really can't see a counterargument to either of those things.- Lack of Lossless audio on their own products. So as many know, Apple has just announced that it will have lossless audio on its Apple Music platform soon, which is a boon to audiophiles everywhere. But in everything I have read about it, they always have the caveat that the lossless audio currently doesn't work with the Airpod Max headphones. Even if you buy the bi-directional cable from Apple. And there has been no "we plan to support it soon" soundbite, or "we will be updating the Airpod Max firmware to be compatible in XXX of 202X". So, if that is super important for you, just know it may not be supported on this model of Airpods Max, possibly at all (Apple is notorious in doing this, and will just release it in the next version). So if it is released eventually, I wouldn't expect it on this model, and you'll have to plunk down another half a thousand bucks to get a set that will work with the feature.WRAP UP/FINAL THOUGHTSIn the end, I'm really pleased with these headphones. They are some of the finest pieces of audio equipment that I have ever owned, and I love all the premium features they included. Certain areas leave something to be desired on them, but they are niggling feature issues or design kinks that will be worked out later. I am hopeful that these headphones will stay the same for a few revisions and the firmware/software will evolve to support more features, as well as the accessories (and third-party solutions) to be able to work more universally with non-Apple products or be more robust in their construction. To be fair, for a first draft Apple product, they are the accessory that I've had the least amount hassle with.All in all, I highly enjoy and recommend these headphones, and if you are an Apple Fan and budding audiophile, I believe you will too. Let's just hope that Apple keeps improving these models to make them feel like they were worth the ~$550 price point.
I solely use apple devices, and was looking for a noise cancelling headset that could easily work between multiple apple devices. The apple AirPods max does exactly that. I have used other headphones in the past like Sony and Bose but honestly I didn‚Äôt like the white noise sound they‚Äôd make, and how frequently frustrating it would be to connect the headphones between various apple devices.The airpod max are a little overpriced in my opinion, and the headphone storage case is pretty useless (it offers zero protection to the headphones. It‚Äôs not a hard case) but it does a very well job of smoothly connecting to my different apple devices depending on which one I‚Äôm using.The noise cancellation is pretty great too, it doesn‚Äôt cancel out 100% of the background noises depending on what that noise is and how realities it is to you.For example, it does a really great job of cancelling the loud construction noises outside my apartment, barking dogs, and people talking in the background but it doesn‚Äôt do as well as job of cancelling out the noise of my boyfriend streaming sports on the background. It cancels a good amount of the game and his ‚Äúenthusiasm‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt cancel as much as I wish it would.Overall I would highly recommend this to anyone who owns multiple apple devices, wants seamless connection, and is looking for a better noise cancelling solution than what the normal air pods offers.
For the past ten years I have enjoyed and been dependent upon noise canceling headphones. With that has come a journey into the audiophile community with others who are on a quest for high-fidelity sound. My journey led me to many headphones that sound absolutely pristine but none with  noise canceling and few are wireless. Until late, the Bose Noise Canceling 700 are my compromise for great sound and noise canceling in a wireless headphone. So, when Apple announced the AirPods Max, I had to try them to know how they compare to my Bose 700. Here are my conclusions so far...STYLEThe fit and finish on the AirPods Max is absolutely beautiful!  Love it much more than the Bose. I just like the way they look and feel. Before I purchased the AirPods I probably watched 50 unboxing and review videos. So, I thought I had a good idea of how they looked.  They are nicer in person.  Sleek, premium, modern and minimalistic.COMFORTComfort is about the same!  AirPods Max are definitely heavier but do not necessarily feel much heavier on he head as the weight is balanced well.  I have larger ears and the ear cups on the Bose 700 go a little deeper to make room for my ears. So, over several hours, the Bose do feel slightly more comfortable. The Bose also do not get as warm as the Apple.TRANSPARENCY MODETransparency mode, in my opinion, is actually more natural on the Bose. The Apple headphones actually amplify the sound around you a few decibles too much. In other words, things sound louder than they actually are with the transparency mode on the AirPods Max.  Also, the Bose reproduces your own voice much more naturally when in transparency mode.SOUND QUALITYSound quality at certain volume levels is almost exactly the same. Kind of unbelievable. It is as though Apple reverse engineered the Bose 700 and copied its sound signature and noice canceling to within 5 percent. There is  a definite sound quality difference though that changes with the volume level. This is all about the DSP. Of course, the digital signal processing (DSP) is called Computational Audio on the Max and Volume Optimized EQ on the Bose. This is what works differently and what accounts for sound differences dependent on the volume. Basically, the Bose sound better at 60 percent volume and below. Bose just has it dialed in so that everything sounds rich and balanced. I usually listen to music at about 55 percent volume on my iPad. So, I prefer the sound of the Bose. The sound at 60 percent and below on the AirPods Max suffers from a veiled upper midrange. An alto saxophone, for example, will sound as though it is being played behind a wooden door.Now between 60 and 70 percent volume is where both headphones sound virtually the same. It is uncanny! Both sound absolutely wonderful. Probably the best you will ever hear on wireless noise canceling headphones (yes, the Sony has an amplified and unnatural mid-bass making them sound deep but not high fidelity).At 70 percent volume and above the Bose DSP begins to lower the bass response to avoid distortion. The bass gets progressively quieter as you increase on the Bose to where there is virtually no bass at about 90 percent volume.  The AirPods Max, on the other hand, handle bass very nicely from 70 all the way up to 100 percent. In fact, they sound perfectly balanced all the way from 60 to 100 percent volume with no sound quality degradation. If there is a fault it is that the bass looses a little nuance. In other words at high volumes the bass is a little over controlled.  The softer vibrations like on the trail of a bass string get lost a little.So to summarize the sound comparisons.  The two headphones sound equal from 60 to 70 percent volume. The Bose sound bette at 60 percent volume and below. Finally, the AirPods sound better (by quite a bit, it‚Äôs not even close) at 70 percent volume and above.CONTROLSThe final comparison are the controls. Apple wins in my book.  The Digital Crown has a perfect feel to it. It rotates very smoothly with a perfect amount of resistance. It presses well also. Apple has hyper dialed-in these controls. It makes me never want to have to use the touch-pad on the Bose 700 ever again.WHICH ONE IS FOR ME?Everything is comparable on these two headphones, but in the end, sound quality at my preferred listening level wins out. Since I listen to at about 50 percent volume, the Bose continue to be he choice for me. I just have a fixed routine for when I use noise canceling headphones.Now, I am sure that Apple could probably update their firmware to adjust the computational audio in order to fix the balance issues below 60 percent volume. If they did, then the fit and finish and controls might win me back over to the AirPods Max.  But, the slight compromise in long-term comfort would cause me to hesitate a little.ONE LAST THINGOne last thing, the spatial audio is pretty Amazing. If I had to watch movies on my iPad these headphones would be a must. The surround sound effects are as good (slightly better) than my Bose home theatre system. The overall sound quality for movies is slightly less (more sterile and hollow sounding, probably because of the limited Bluetooth codec) than my Bose home theatre system.
I know that there are a lot of mixed reviews for these headphones, but honestly after having them just for a day, I have since ignored all said reviews. I do understand that the retail price point for these is quite absurd, and that is the only thing that couldn't justify a purchase of these for me, but if you can find them below $490, I really do think that these are worth it. Let's get into it!Pros:- Complete compatibility - With Apple devices, easy pairing and easy management is seamless. These make more sense in my opinion if the majority of your daily use devices are Apple, because they are just made to work and boy, do they work well.- Noice cancelling - This is something in my opinion that Apple has always excelled in, ever since the AirPods Pro. The cancellation is perfect and honestly a little crazy how well they work. I was screaming music at near full volume and couldn't hear myself at all. Also, the transparency mode works well as always, especially considering that these are over the ear headphones.- Build quality and comfort - Obviously this is a more premium product, and it shows. Every aspect of the headphones are fine tuned and made to perfection, and it sure feels like it. Putting them on for the first time was a bit wonky, as I needed to get used to them, but once I adjusted the headband and got used to the fit, they were great. I can see myself wearing these for hours on end without any problems. Just make sure that you take care of them well, and they will last.- Sound quality - These sound GREAT. They get pretty loud and once you tinker around with some EQ settings and for certain things turn off Dolby Atmos (I can find it makes some things a bit quieter), these are amazing. Honestly, Apple should make car speakers or just separate bluetooth speakers, because their technology at this point is a the top of the market in my opinion. Now, if you are an audiophile, these may not completely cater to all of your desired points, as they don't officially support lossless audio, but for the average consumer these sound great. And if you want to get even better sound quality, you can purchase Apple's lighting to 3.5mm cable (yes, it is $35, I know. Absurd.)Cons:- Price point - At a retail of $549, these are stupid expensive. You do get what you pay for, but I still think a lower price would make more sense as there are other options on the market that are more feature heavy. But again, at a lower price point, (I was able to snag these for $449), I think they're great.- Not for everyone - What you need to understand with Apple products is that they aren't made for everyone and aren't catered to everyone's needs. Yes, the Sony WH-1000XM4s (phew) have more features overall, and are more customizable to one's needs, but everything Apple has ever made has always been that way. They decide to include less features to make a more perfect overall product, catering to their target Apple user. These headphones are one of many examples of that - Apple is always quoted to "fall behind" android in the smartphone OS market, but they are merely taking more time perfecting what they do to work as well as possible for as long as possible.So, in conclusion, if you think that these would be good for you, and work well for your lifestyle and devices, take a shot at them. Just compare all your options and depending on what you want or need, these may or may not fit in. I don't think you will be disappointed if you do decide to get them.
These are my favorite headphones. When you account for the sound quality, noise cancellation, convenience, comfort and the quality of the build, it makes the price more palatable.That said, there's no denying that they are expensive. At the same time, they pretty much reside in their own category of headphones. You can easily get better sounding headphones for less than $200 - but those are wired and lack active noise cancelling. You can shop around other Bluetooth headphones with ANC (XM4, QCII35, 700 etc‚Ä¶) but those don't sound as good. Though they certainly don't sound bad and they're a couple of Benjamins cheaper. I firmly believe the Max's ANC is also better than all the previously mentioned gear, though not by much when compared to the XM4s. One very nice thing about the AirPods Max is the ANC causes no hiss at all, not even a little.But there's just no comparison when you compare the build and comfort. Other Bluetooth ANC headphones feel cheap. Once you handle the faux leather and creaky plastic parts you understand why they're much less expensive. The cloth and foam ear pads on the Max are nearly perfect. They form a good seal, even with glasses, and they‚Äôre comfortable for long listening sessions. The aluminum and stainless steel parts feel both durable and even luxurious. The mesh headband distributes the Max's substantial weight very evenly. Moreover, everything is modular and repairable on the Max. The circuit boards, batteries, cups, pads, the headband itself - all disassemble with relative ease so your purchase may just last for decades.Much has been made of the Max‚Äôs weight. In my experience, it‚Äôs a non issue. Lounging in the house, washing dishes, sitting at the computer - the weight is fine. BUT, the clamping force is another matter. These things firmly squeeze your head. Initially, I thought I was going to have to return them. Having used them for a couple weeks, they‚Äôve loosened significantly. Possibly, I‚Äôve also acclimated to them.Transparency mode is amazing. Without doubt, it‚Äôs the best implementation I‚Äôve heard. I‚Äôve yet to try out Spacial Audio because until it works with my TV, it‚Äôs a gimmick that I don‚Äôt care about. I don‚Äôt watch movies on my iPhone or even iPad. If you do, you may feel differently.I do wish I could use them to block out sounds without playing music or white noise. But when not playing audio, the ANC causes too much pressure on my eardrums.I also wish there were an accompanying App that enabled more intuitive EQ or control of other settings: like perhaps degrees of ANC or better monitoring of battery life and standby. This seems like an oversight on Apple‚Äôs part.Yes, the case isn‚Äôt much of a case and it is annoying that they don‚Äôt include a cable for wired listening. But those are small things and do not detract from the sound quality, convenience and materials of the headphones themselves.The ear pads do make my ears warm in my usage. I don‚Äôt see how any closed back headphone with a decent seal wouldn‚Äôt make one‚Äôs ears warm. That said, the warmth doesn‚Äôt bother me at all and I don‚Äôt feel that they‚Äôre uncomfortably hot.Recently, there have been many reports of condensation and/or sweat accumulating beneath the ear pads on the plastic housing that protects the drivers. Though I don‚Äôt doubt these accounts, I have yet to have it happen. After using the AirPods Max for three to four hours, at my desk and around the house, they‚Äôre as dry as can be. I don‚Äôt know what combination of temperature, humidity, body heat and time causes moisture to appear. All I can suggest is that if you purchase the AirPods Max, try and reproduce the issue with your normal usage. Hopefully, it will be a non issue for you as well.If you own a couple of Apple devices, say a Mac and an iPhone, the Max‚Äôs convenience makes them even more compelling. Normal Bluetooth pairing can be mildly annoying or, depending on your devices, VERY frustrating. There‚Äôs no such hassle with the AirPods Max. They just connect. They just switch. They just work.If you‚Äôre cross shopping, there are a couple of Bluetooth headphones that might sound slightly better, but they lack ANC. There are many, many headphones that are both cheaper and sound better, but they are wired and lack ANC. The AirPods Max really are in a different class compared to the $350 range of Bluetooth ANC headphones the market has become used to.In my opinion, these should not be compared with lesser ANC BT headphones but with the BO H95s. Though I've never owned the H95s, I have held, listened to and envied them. They‚Äôre amazing. But they‚Äôre also $800 and the ANC is not as advanced. In comparison, the AirPods Max are a bargain, even if they don‚Äôt sound quite as nice as the H95s - though they are very close.I‚Äôm very pleased with the AirPods Max. As a complete package, I‚Äôm not aware of any other headphones, at any price, that are competitive.*UPDATE*This morning I shoveled snow for a little over an hour while wearing the AirPods Max. Admittedly, my understanding of atmospheric physics is pretty low, but I figured my very warm head combined with freezing temperatures affecting the aluminum would likely induce some condensation. But, after shoveling, they were as dry as can be. Again, I'm not casting doubt on the many reports of moisture below the ear pads, but I can't reproduce the effect.
Well, I was having difficulty deciding after spending hours each of several days doing research. Most reviewers chose the Sony XM4 because of its much lower price, less weight and proven comfort and reliability. Of course that wasn‚Äôt good enough for me because I thought I was a little more audoholic than many so I needed to make a more insightful discovery. I had a Sennheiser several decades ago that was nothing more than a small piece of foam over a small driver and wired of course. It sounded awesome believe it or not so I moved on over to the Sennheiser Momentum 300 which most reviewers rated at or near the top in sound quality and build. It was marked down for modest noise reduction capability and a weight of 300 grams lying in between the Sony at 245 grams and the APMax at 385. Sony is plastic, Apple is metal and fiber and the Momentum is metal and real leather on the ear pads and headband. Apple Earphones are new age sexy, Sennheiser Momentum 300 are retro cool and Sony let‚Äôs call modern but plain. Price wise Sony is no higher than $348, Sennheiser is available for $330 down from $400 at introduction in 2019 or so and Apple is $550.Apple does Apple and I have discovered first hand how brutal they are about forcing you to do what they want. If you try to do anything other than pair them with your iPhone or iPad you will meet roadblocks. They only offer music at 48 kilobits per second so that is all they allow you to listen to in their headphones. If you try to hook up to a device with a higher bit rate it will be reduced before it passes through to your headphones. You can theoretically pay $35 for a special little wire that allows you to connect to a device that would otherwise allow you to plug into a receiver. You can only get it from Apple and even then the 3.5 mmonnection won‚Äôt fit into receivers because they take a larger jack which is 6.35. So while they sell adapters that will fit the bill they aren‚Äôt Apple approved. In short they don‚Äôt just want you to buy and use all their equipment. They force you to use their other products to use the headphones successfully. The weight of the Air Pods Max coupled with what they call clamping force makes them very uncomfortable to wear and don‚Äôt even think about exercising or running in them. They will bounce around as you move and I began to feel strain and stress from the fit within ten minutes. Sure, I bought them to entertain myself on long walks but I don‚Äôt know where I would put them for the walk home when they are too heavy to wear. You cannot hang them around your neck without choking yourself and then there is the bra/purse like carrier if you was to carry that. Won‚Äôt fold in on itself like many of most headphones.No matter how sexy it looks or how cool it makes you feel to be envied for your coolness the grimace on your face after an hour with these on your head will not attract anyone. I really wanted these as I was telling myself they must have the best sound quality and that is what I am all about. Still  if I don‚Äôt like wearing them the music doesn‚Äôt help much and I am left with hoping a really cool person or persons will see that I am cool also. I don‚Äôt hate Apple and I have an IPhone 10max and an iPad(I bought my first one in April 2010 when the first one was introduced and was the very first truly friendly computer like device) and a MacBook Pro which I won‚Äôt replace.With these headphones they have gone too far with the silly and unnecessary allegiance to Apple required to use it easily. You can search for hours online to find workarounds but half or more of what people suggest doesn‚Äôt work. Meanwhile Apple knows all of this and basically gives us the old high hat if we are willing to buy products that compel us to buy only their other products to make them work. Connecting instantly to my iPhone when picked up or put on rather than having to use a typical Bluetooth prompt to accept a connection is not worth enslaving myself just to show aluminum on my ears. I am boxing these up even though they arrived earlier today. I bought them from Amazon because of their stellar return policy and I recommend you do the same if you want to try these. If I kept them I would be doing what many who read my review will do and that is defend and rationalize my choice. That is what human beings do. So if Apple product allegiances are important to you after spending this amount of money on top of all the other products you have bought from them feel free to put it on blast. I know this is a lot of money to spend for many if not most people and I wanted to write something for folks who haven‚Äôt had time to do a lot of research and are at a decision point.I am torn between the Sony XM4(leaving me light headed and looking average) and the Sennheiser Momentum 300(xciting to listen to but making me look my retro like my age). If you want to check out online reviews you will find that deciding who to listen to and trust is every bit as difficult as making your headphone choice. I don‚Äôt know who receives what in the way of free products to use or resell or even monetary compensation which might disappear with too much honesty. All I can do is tell you what I think and let you take it into consideration if helpful.I don‚Äôt care about corporations especially large ones as they take care of themselves just fine. I have learnedthat there are people who are loyal to and defend corporations and don‚Äôt like others criticizing them or their products. In my own life I find that my weakest point is often my best point pushed too far. I think the exuberance for these Air Max headphones and Apples marketing games has likely reached that place with these headphones. Who knows? Maybe I will update my review once I try the Sony or the Sennheiser or both. For now I will be happy to merely take a heavy load off my head!
These are amazing! I have AirPods Pro‚Äôs and these are much better in noise cancellation and noise quality! Love them so much, however I will say I can‚Äôt workout in them because I have a super small head and even in the smallest setting they fall off if I do too much in them, like unloading my dishwasher is the most I can do and even then I feel sometimes like they might fall off. I do have a small head though but other than that I love them! They work perfect for school and work! One other thjnk is I wear makeup and they don‚Äôt take off the makeup like when I lift it up I don‚Äôt see a line where they were but the headphones get dirty with the makeup and it gets hard to clean off
After I perused the specs and got over the sticker shock of the price tag, I thought, ‚ÄúThese might be worth the investment for me.‚Äù I have high-end hearing loss, and because of that, most speakers, earbuds, and headphones don‚Äôt do much for me. I have an especially hard time hearing dialogue on our TV unless the sound is being pumped through our HomePods. That is what caused me to pause and really consider the purchase. ‚ÄúWhat if the AirPods Max is like putting HomePods on your ears?‚Äù That was worth it to me.After setup was completed, I put the headphones on my ears and heard the first sounds through the AirPods Max. It was a Christmas song that I had heard dozens of times before. The sound was so rich, deep, and clear that it was like I was hearing the song for the first time. ‚ÄúOk, there is no way these sound this good.‚Äù At that moment, Robyn, my fiance, walked into the room and said, ‚ÄúSo, are they like having HomePods attached to your ears?‚Äù All I could do was nod yes. She gave me a look and I handed them over to her. She put the headphones on her ears and scrolled through my library until she found something she wanted to play. She then said she had to have a pair.When I test headphones, I have a few go-to songs I like to try out so that I can get an idea of the listening experience of the headphones from every angle. The songs are pulled from a variety of genres including soundtracks, rock, grunge, punk, classical, and even a bit of rap. The AirPods Max does an incredibly nice job with all of them. The headphones keep a nice, deep bass sound while protecting the integrity of the rest of the track. I also found that vocals are crisp as well and I really love that as I turn up the volume, that I don‚Äôt get any distortion. That‚Äôs not been the case with other headphones I‚Äôve used.Overall, I‚Äôve been impressed with all the features of the AirPods Max. Here‚Äôs a brief rundown of my thoughts on the main features of the headphones.Active Noise Canceling (ANC): Until I used the AirPods Max, the ANC on the Sony headphones was the best I‚Äôve ever used. I took the Sony headphones on a flight a few years back and never heard the airplane‚Äôs engine noise. Therefore, I‚Äôve always regarded the ANC on the Sony MDR-1000X as the ‚Äòbest‚Äô. While I haven‚Äôt taken the AirPods Max on a plane yet, I can say that it deadens ambient noises like dogs barking, vacuums, and TVs that are left on in the background.Mesh Headband:  I love the look of the headband. I think it looks very clean and it accentuates the lines of the AirPods Max. The design is right up my alley.Weight: I‚Äôve heard some people say that the weight of the headphones is an issue for them. I have noticed that they feel a bit heavier than other headphones I‚Äôve used, but the weight seems evenly distributed to me and so it doesn‚Äôt bother me. I‚Äôve worn the headphones for several hours at a time and have not had any issues with headaches or soreness.Buttons: I am a big fan of the buttons. This is odd for me to say since I never thought I would be a proponent of moving to analog from digital, but Apple did a nice job of blending in the Digital Crown and the ANC button.Smart Case: This is one thing I would have reconsidered if I were designing the AirPods Max ‚Äî the Smart Case. I really consider it more of a ‚Äòsleeve‚Äô than a case because ‚Äî well, that‚Äôs what it is. The sleeve is made with a single piece of what seems to be polyurethane material and utilizes magnets for the closure. While the sleeve does protect the metal earpieces of the headphones from getting scratched up, for the most part, it doesn‚Äôt protect the headband and there is even a cut out on the bottom that leaves the headphones exposed to the elements and potential damage. I also noticed that when I take the headphones out of the sleeve that the AirPods clink together. The only way I‚Äôve been able to stop that from happening is if I physically place my hand there.Even though there might be a few minor things I would like to see improved about the AirPods Max, I‚Äôm absolutely thrilled with them. They are far superior to any other listening experience I‚Äôve had and think that their price tag is worth the investment. Even though the cost is prohibitive for many, if you want the ultimate listening experience, I can‚Äôt recommend the AirPods Max enough.
There are certainly cheaper headphones with equivalent sound quality, but these are well-constructed, comfortable for extended wear, have streamlined physical controls which are satisfying to use, and work hand in glove with an iPhone- it doesn't even shut off completely, it just senses when it's off your ears, and pauses playback.  Removing this one layer of friction means I'm more likely to take the headphones off when I want to give my ears a breather, and the phone goes back to using its internal speaker while I catch up on email or whatever, and back into the music/podcasts just by putting the phones on.  The earpads, held in place by magnets, are secure, but detach without a struggle for cleaning, and their texture is sufficiently breathable and spacious to make for long listening sessions with better overall comfort than most, IMO.  L and R channels are marked by a pattern sewn inside the ear cups- a little hard to see, as it's a similar color, but easy to tell in the dark if you remember that the controls are all on the right channel.  And they give you a clickable knob for volume and basic track controls, similar in feel to the crown for the Apple Watch, just on a bigger scale.  The other control, a button which toggles the transparency of the noise cancellation, is immensely handy, and allows you to converse with people and clearly hear others without having to shift the phones off your ears.  NC reduces even a screaming vacuum cleaner to a muted hum.  The spatial audio, for apps that support it, can be a little uncanny at first, and familiar to Airpod Pro users- it does feel like the audio is coming right out of the phone, rather than the sound being piped into your ears.  The default carrying case has taken criticism for only covering the cans and not providing much protection, but I kind of like it for the portability- it packs up like a little handbag, and the headstrap becomes a handle.  I might buy a third party box if I ever need to pack it for a long flight, but this is fine for my daily needs.  When the cans are folded for storage, the metal shells kind of clack together without the case, and is definitely in keeping with Apple's design philosophy of charging end users a lot of money for a product which demands additional accessories just to keep it from denting and scratching.There is no traditional headphone jack on the the thing, and it doesn't look like there's even a way to connect it with an adapter, which is unfortunate and should be a dealbreaker if you need that.  I just need the Bluetooth, though, and the supported BT 5.0 sounds fine to my ears.There is an option to help locate the phones with Find My, though it will only show where they were last connected to your phone, and it even allows you to play a locator noise through the speakers, so you can hear them in a relatively quiet space from about 8 feet away.  What would really have been cool is if they incorporated an AirTag in their design, because at about $500, I live with the uncomfortable possibility of them being stolen if I turn my back.In short, they are comfortable, they are expensive, they sound great, but if you want skull-rattling bass, there are better options.  They'll work with any Bluetooth-enabled source, though you'll probably only feel their full value if you intend to use them with Apple products, and if I do ever lose them, I'll be ordering a new pair the next day.(Added 7/31)About a month ago, I started hearing some weird distortion, then one day, six months from purchase, they just refused to sync. I don‚Äôt know exactly what the cause was, but I do wear them in hot summer weather and was surprised to find that some sweat can build up behind the ear cushions, so maybe that‚Äôs the culprit?  I dunno. They‚Äôre the only Apple product I have with the AppleCare+ coverage, and replacement was quick and painless, so I consider that money well spent.Anyway, nobody said these things were waterproof, which is why I was so careful with them. I still wear them outdoors, but now I pull the ear cushions off every few hours to see if any water has built up inside the cups. Gross.I also toss them in a baby bottle sterilizer at the end of the day. Nobody should have to deal with manky earmuffs!
I have many sets of headphones, some very nice ones, and these stand alone in terms of being something different - there is so much tech jammed into these, it makes them very different than anything else on the market.Sound - Sound quality on these is very good, very clean. Personally I'd like a lot more bass, but even someone who isn't a basshead would still probably like more bass. They're not weak or anything on the low end side, and booming bass is there, it's just too much in the background for my tastes. If stupid iOS just gave you an EQ, you could probably easily fix this, and some of the sound profiles you do get can hep, but for the love of everything, just give me a stupid EQ so I can choose the sound I want. In any case, again, the sound is very good, very clean. I'd say it's pretty easily better than my Bose QC25 but not on-par with my Beyerdynamic DT 990 open backed headphones (which I still think are the best headphones I've heard and I've compared them against sets costing well over $1k). But these headphones are about a lot more than sound, and that's why they go up to 5-stars...Sound Field/Stage - The sound stage on these, the openness of the sound, is amazing for closed back headphones. When you're playing music that supports Apples spatial sound (everything in Apple Music for example) it's incredible, it really feels/sounds natural a lot of the time. I've used other 'virtual surround' garbage, and it's terrible, but whatever Apple is doing, it works. My favorite thing is that you can set your phone in front of you, then walk around, and it sounds like the sound is coming from the direction of the iPhone, so it gives you this incredible sense of space (and it does not hurt the sound quality - for most music it sounds better in my opinion). This is something you really have to experience to understand as I don't know of anyone else that does this - and it's really impressive in person.Noise Cancelling - Absolutely top notch. Between the good fit of the headphones and the actual tech, you can block out a ton of stuff, they work better than my Bose QC25's, that still were best in class as of a year ago. Also, for the cry babies, I do not notice the pressure effect - it might be there still, but it's not nearly as noticeable as the Bose.Battery Life - Seems to be excellent. Only downside is it uses an iPhone plug, not USB C. I still have and need an iPhone plug so it's not a huge deal at the moment, but for the future, when it's all USB C, this is going to become a pain.Comfort - It's pretty comfortable. I heard lots of people say these are big and heavy and uncomfortable, and while they are big and heavy, for me at least they're pretty comfortable. Those Beyerdynamic DT 990 are amazingly comfortable, can wear them for hours, that's not the case here. But compared to my Bose QC25, I can wear the AirPods Max for longer without any issues. Still, it's not like the comfort of earbuds, which I can wear all day, but for big over the ear headphones, the Max's are pretty good.Build Quality - Top notch in my opinion, make everything else I've ever used, anything else I've ever even tried, feel plasticky and cheap.Wireless - No lag, no drops, works great. I wish they had upped the bandwidth so you could carry stuff like fully uncompressed audio, like blu-ray audio, but probably have to wait for V2 for that. With that said, I've never really noticed anything, everything sounds full with no compression. Obviously that isn't the case, but just saying, I do not notice any negatives as far as wireless goes.Overall, 5-stars. The sound, with less bass than I'd like and with no EQ in iOS, only gets 4-stars, but the other features make these unique and quite amazing. The spatial sound is what makes these special, and you can't get that with any other over the ear headphones, and it works remarkably well. I think it uses actual head movement for tracking, so it's not just a software gimmick they can do on any other headphones (I think that's the case), but it' something you need to hear in person to appreciate.

I have the bereynamic 1990 pros. Those are excellent I use those for Opera which I don't listen to classical music rock and anything that was made by a human that sounds really awesome.I didn't want to wear those out though because those are like $600. I needed something to play video games with and still hear high fidelity electronic music without wearing out those headphones. I think these are perfect for that. There's good detail in the bass out of the box and everything's really balanced. You might have to toy with an equalizer to bring up the highs that you want, but that's not so bad considering that the $600 headphones I have have really sharp high frequencies. These are good because they have good detail in the bass without equalizing and you can still hear everything else in a balanced way.I think the first thing you need to do with these is just plug them into an amp/dac and then play around with equalization so you might want to bring up the mids a little bit and make them more pronounced as I said everything's really balanced and flat it's not a bad thing but it does mean that if there are certain parts of a song that you like a lot you might want to make it more distinct.Also keep in mind that every song sounds a bit different and has different pronunciations and different frequencies if you equalize a song it'll sound amazing but then the next song played on that equalization setting won't sound as good you might be bringing up the highs when they're all ready too high. You can you can usually equalize for a particular music genre like electronic. An electronic I probably keep the highs the same to avoid the hi-hats getting into my ear too much but maybe increase the mids and the lows.Still though after trying the $600 headphones and then switching to these 1 minute later there's not a huge amount of difference in the detail it's more about the headroom and the soundstage and those $600 headphones the 1990s really be these in that area but as far as detail these are still really good.I also have the Bose quiet comfort 35 II's. These beat those out of the water. For $170 I don't know if you can find better sound quality.They are very light I thought the box was empty when I first got it lol but it's actually kind of nice because these are the phones that I'm going to be wearing for like 12 hours straight while I'm gaming they're great . don't look around anywhere else just get these unless you can spend over $250. Maybe not even then. To get a huge significant upgrade from these you would probably have to spend close to $400 or more.Take it all with a grain of salt though I got my first stack and amp maybe half a year ago and all of these headphones I referenced I've gotten within the past 2 years I'm not exactly an audiophile, but I am pretty good at picking the best products in the price points and I think I have done this with this product.
When I grew up I often listened to my father's Stax electrostatic headphones. I've always compared headphones against them and none have measured up until now. The Sennheiser 560 S comes extremely close. They will reveal everything about the recording you are listening to in a fantastically neutral but highly accurate way. The soundstage and imaging are marvelous. So the good is they will reveal everything. The intricate details of an instrument, voice, or sound effects will be reproduced in full detail, imaging, and clarity. Pretty much if it's in the recording, you will hear it, neutrally and naturally. The bad is they will reveal everything. For example, if you play analog recordings, you will likely hear every possible flaw, including any hiss, distortion, or saturation.As to powering them. They work perfectly with an iPad hooked using an Apple USB-C to 3.5mm adapter with the built-in DAC. I suggest getting the Kingston Nucleum USB C Hub, 7-In-1 Type-C-Adapter Hub to power the iPad and use the Apple headphone adapter at the same time.They work perfectly with an iPhone 12 Pro with the Apple lightning to 3.5 mm adapter with built-in DAC.A tip. If you find the sound too low, check the following:Settings -> Sound & Haptics -> Headphone SafetyChange / adjust - Reduce Loud SoundsI suggest getting Apple's official headphone adapter/dongles. They are rated the best for a super low price.They also work perfectly with a NAD - D 3020 v2 Hybrid Digital Integrated Amplifier. For that, I use an Airport Express 2nd generation to play Apple Music (aux input) or the digital input of the NAD for compact discs.For this inexpensive price, you will hear what would typically cost a few thousand dollars to achieve with electrostatic headphones or several thousand for a decently amplified stereo speaker system. Well worth it.
You can find a million reviews for these phones and they are very well thought of  and they mostly met my expectation. I'll give a few places there they did not.(of course just my opinion, we all have a different 'sound' we are looking for, but I found them a bit... neutral. No matter how I EQ them I find them a bit "cold", lacking a certain musical quality. I dunno, maybe it takes $300 to get that, or a DAC maybe.The bass is not quite as tight/resolving as I wanted. I could not quite distinguish between the bass guitar and kick drum that way I was hoping. But I had high hopes and maybe too high for $150 cans.I have had very high-end speakers in the past and got used to details like hearing the tip of the drumstick on the cymbals, the click of a tongue on certain sung notes, etc. These don't quite reach that point. But you can hear David Gilmour shifting in his seat and clearing his throat before starting the intro on Wish You Were Here.Comfort is OK, I don't have much to compare them to but the first night I wore them for 3 hours. But the pads feel hard and the headband bugs me. I can see myself shopping for different pads.My system is modest compared to some. I'm running this off a PC with about as good a DAC chip as you can get on a motherboard. An external DAC might be in my future. Maybe I can find one that sweetens them up a bit.I like them, but just can't quite give them 5 stars and might keep shopping.
I bought these to replace a set of K712's. The 712's are known to have a huge sound stage for gaming, but in my experience the 560s is even better and has more accurate positional audio and clearer imaging. For example when playing FPS games I can hear people running around in rooms above me, whereas with the K712 it sounded like those footsteps were coming from non-distinct locations in the same room. Music sounds good as well, vocals seem a little clearer than the K712 and there is slightly more bass.I have them hooked up to a JDS Atom+ amp and dac, but they also work fine plugged into my PC's motherboard audio.The comfort is great, I can wear them for hours with no issue. One thing that could be improved would be to have numbers on the headband extension notches so that you don't have to do any guesswork when trying to match the length on both sides.
Great detailed, wide sound stage for gaming. I could hear details in VALORANT and Apex Legends that I could have never gotten before with my previous A40s. I was able to also pinpoint how far of a distance that footsteps were coming from. Amazing for picking up on subtle footsteps/audio that could give you the edge in-game. The headphones are really comfortable and I could wear them for hours. They're good for music listening, but don't expect a lot of bass. It sounds very basic in terms of music listening and that's not a bad thing.Some nitpicking, the earcups have already begun to build up dust. The headphones do take a couple of days to break in because they are a little tight. The included wire is very long.
This is the second Sennheiser headphone I‚Äôve ever owned. Its sound quality is much better than I expected. I always played Tchaikovsky 1812 overture to review the speakers or headphones that I was going to buy.It‚Äôs a great headphones because of its Frequency Response: 6 ‚Äì 38,000 Hz which is much wider than other brand headphones.I love it. And I believe I will enjoy classical musicwith this headphone for years.By the way I don‚Äôt buy blue tooth cordless headphones, because blue tooth headphones are not good enough.
I am using a G6 DAC with this and the default sound without any profiles used, etc.. sounds a bit muffled. Voices don't sound like they would in real life ( It helps to record audio from someone you know and play it back to help calibrate ).With my previous headset, I had to tune it quite a lot and get it sounding good but the sound stage on those aren't as good as this. In games you can accurately pick out locations pretty easily but I still have to do more testing to see if it justifies paying this much, especially because voices sound off, music sounds muffled, etc..Treble on these headsets is very sharp, similar to my previous headset ( which I tuned down ) but very slightly less. It is ear-piercing and hurts.I don't know why noise-cancellation is an option as these are open-back and no mic.The open-back design is nice as it expands the sound-stage.The headset is about half the weight of my previous headset so that is a plus, however the major flaw is how it sits on the head. You want the clamping force to have the pillows apply even force all the way around your ears, but these are more /o o\ rather than \o o/ or |o o| which causes sound to escape out the bottom and actually hurts the sound stage. When moving my ears I can improve the sound quality a decent amount, but holding those muscles in that position is difficult for long periods. I loosened the headband so much that the headband barely touches the top of my head to make it somewhat fit but it doesn't feel secure and the cushions still don't fit right or help the sound quality.Because this is made of plastic I can't simply adjust the headband to make it fit without breaking them.I'm giving this 3 of 5 because of the sound stage, the decent sound quality ( when I move my ears ), how lightweight they are, the oversized area for your ears and the fact that it has a removable cable.I am docking 2 points because these don't quite fit, and the sound is quite muffled even with moving my ears. I shouldn't need to use an equalizer for this headset; however, when tuning it the sound quality can be improved but moving my ears kills it and because it doesn't sit quite right it is easy to change how the sound enters the ear and ruining the immersion. The other issue is this doesn't have a removable cable on both ears, and I've owned many headsets and they typically fail when the internal cable going through the headband wears out as I tend to baby my headsets but just the motion of putting them on and taking them off causes rubbing.I am currently looking for an alternative and will likely be returning these soon, but I'm going to see if there is anything I can do to help with the issues I've had.
The cable is weird, but the tuning is dead neutral. Bad recordings will sound boxy. Low distortion makes these babies an Objectivist's dream. Likely the most neutral dynamic driver under $300. I love them for gaming.
These headphones are magical. Especially for vocals, it made me fall in love with singers I never paid attention too before and I usually don't pay too much attention the the singer.So much clarity. Its so easy to pick out parts of songs and just listen to that one thing.However they aren't very comfortable. They CLAMP with the power of a thousand suns and I wear glasses. Pain.Also it makes a lot of songs sound bad. A lot of pop songs that you probably like. My experience was these headphones made a song sound like a 15/10 magical experience; its like hearing the same song but its brand new to youor it was a 2/10. Songs I already knew and loved sounded so bad that if I had heard them with only these headphones I never would have thought the song was good at all.
A little background on my experiences with studio headphones in general: I've really struggled to find a good pair over the years that accomplished exactly what I was looking for and gave me a good way to monitor mixes when I don't have access to full studio monitors (which is, most of the time.) I've tried both closed-backed and open-backed variants of reference headphones and had mixed results with pretty much every one of them. These however, I haven't found a single issue with in terms of sound and results. They're extremely natural to my ears, and are very crisp and clear. To me, they don't have this huge, binaural-eseque soundstage to them compared to some other open-backed sets I've tried, but their openness does lend to everything sounding more clear and separate compared to the closed sets I've used, for sure. And I'd venture to say they are the most comfortable variant of open back sets I've worn as well. Ever since I purchased these I've noticed subtle mixing choice differences I have made in recent projects that have really elevated how consistent my tracks sound on various devices, in my experience - if I can get something to sound good on these, they'll sound great on everything else I try, and phenomenal on my listening sets of choice! I wouldn't say these offer anything spicy in terms of sound, or lean at all in the "fun" side of things. But for analytical use? These rock.

The only time I found myself skeptical with making this purchase was after going down the "1 star review" rabbit hole. I've always wanted a pair of Bose headphones (over other competing brands) and I decided to go with these instead of the more expensive version. I grew tired of wearing earbuds and needed something that could serve as a multi-purpose headphone (bluetooth/answering calls). The price was well within the range that I was looking to spend. The headphones come in a nice case (make sure to search inside for the charger and an additional cord) and fit quite comfortably. I wouldn't say the headphones completely cancel surrounding noise, but it acts as a good 'noise blockage' where distracting background noises become faint, leaving you completely immersed in whatever it is you're listening to. Also, the battery charge is impressive (for now). At the time of this review, I've had the headphones for about a week (charged it on day one to 100%, used them every day thereafter, and they're still running at 40% almost 7 days later).For those looking for added bass, you might want to look elsewhere or purchase a more expensive version. My only gripe so far comes with answering the phone. The headphones are very sensitive to the slightest sounds - ie; running water, where it echoes into the headphone and disrupts the caller on the other end. Also, I don't believe I can sync the headphones to my soundbar (which is bluetooth compatible). Would love to wear these at home in front of the TV if possible. If I can figure the latter out, then these are 5 stars easily.
EDIT: After owning these headphones for just a few days over a year, read my updated review beneath the original!After reading reviews and seeing nothing but outstanding remarks for these headphones, I decided to drop the cash and give it a shot. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. I'm definitely an audiophile; I produced EDM music for quite a while which trained me to care about proper balance in songs. These headphones have AMAZING balance! Most expensive headphones that I've tried on just have a crazy boosted bass and it gives me a headache. Not to mention, it just doesn't sound good haha! Anyway, these headphones have super crisp highs, good mids, and crunchy bass. They really are perfect.As for comfort, I could easily wear these things all day. Sometimes I forget I'm even wearing these headphones... They look pretty stylish and they aren't too big. The carrying case is pretty lowkey and it works fine, no problems there. Headphones charge fast and the battery lasts me about a week with daily usage.I enjoy the little voice that sounds whenever you switch devices or turn on the headphones. It's not obnoxious in the slightest. Bluetooth is always a little finicky but these headphones connect almost flawlessly. They automatically reconnect to your last device and that makes things go A LOT faster! Switching devices is pretty simple too.Using the included aux cord doesn't effect sound quality at all. Good for conserving battery life is you don't particularly need the wireless feature at the time of listening!Overall, I'm more than satisfied with my purchase. It was well worth the money and I would recommend these headphones to anyone AND everyone! If you have any questions, leave a comment and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.EDIT:As mentioned above, I've owned these headphones for a little over a year now and I'm still impressed. Even after 1 entire year of extensive use (multiple road trips, a whole school year in the backpack, recording, listening, calling) these still work flawlessly and I've had ZERO major problems whatsoever. Long story short, I'm still sticking with the 5 star review. Below is a little more detail:Physical: No physical damage at all. I try to take care of my stuff, but accidents happen and these headphones have not sustained any scratches, dents, or cracked despite my heavy usage. The foam-ish headband piece still holds its shape. The earphones are still fluffy and squishy (no tears or deformities). At some point in my 1 year of ownership, the little piece of fabric that has the "L" on it (inside the left ear cup; it covers the electronics and such) started slipping out, but I was able to finagle it back in and there's been no problem since. I use the case basically whenever I transport these headphones and that's probably the main reason they've maintained physical integrity. Highly recommend using that case. It's small, sleek, and effective.Sound: I haven't owned any other headphones since these so I can't compare the sound of other headphones to these, however, I'm about to purchase a Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro which is known for it's studio quality, neutral sound. I'll compare the sound when I purchase them. I have noticed problems occasionally when connected to multiple devices. If the headphones are connected to my iPhone and my MacBook I sometimes have a little lag when watching YouTube. But as mentioned by another reviewer, turning on and off the headphones solves this. I don't get too many phone calls, but the several calls I've had while wearing these headphones were crystal clear and easy to understand (on both ends, I asked). I've had several VERY minor issues with the Bluetooth connectivity overall, but Bose regularly puts out firmware updates for their hardware and they've solved many of these issues. I'd say check about once a month for updates on their update site: http://btu.bose.com/The only negative: since these are over-the-ear headphones, they have some natural sound cancelling properties, but after I tried out some Bose Active Noise Cancelling Headphones at Target, I can't even BEGIN to explain how amazing the active noise cancelling was. With the Bose SoundLink headphones, the natural noise cancelling is good. It blocks out a majority of background noise and outsiders cannot hear my music at all (unless it's turned up very high... don't do that!). But with the active noise cancelling headphones, it's almost magical. You put those headphones on and it's just dead silent. These headphones are perfect as they are, but if you can afford it, go for a pair of Bose headphones with active noise cancelling. Just my suggestion.Tip: If you use these headphones for mixing (which I'll update the sound comparison part of this review when I get my new DT770 Pro's), make sure to use the custom aux cable provided. This ensures there's no Bluetooth interference and you get the clearest sound quality. These aren't studio headphones, but if you want headphones to use in combination with studio monitors (as a reference listening device) or if you need a good pair of monitor headphones that can double as comfort/listening headphones, these work great.
I like the fee of these headphone as I was having a hard time finding a pair that I could wear for a long period of time without it hurting my ear and these do the job. Two things I didn‚Äôt like were that they feel a bit loose I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll wear these for exercise. Second whenever I use the microphone I constantly hear my echo and people on the other end of my call cannot hear me well it annoying. But for the most part they are ok.
Exactly what we were looking for for my son‚Äôs birthday gift. I liked that those could be wireless or you can use a wire. This comes in handy for travel on the plane. It can also be used with some of his games that require plug in headphones. Excellent quality too.
As others have mentioned, when I got this headset, the microphone was unusable. Some faulty firmware caused the mic volume to go up or down with the headset volume. I downloaded the Bose app and updated the firmware and everything worked great. I do not like the fact that the mic sound feeds into the earphones (sort of feedback). I'm used to using headsets that only supply audio from a source, not mixed with my own voice and background noise. This only occurs when you are on a call.I'm giving this product 5 stars because I wear headphones about 8 hours a day, and these are one of the most comfortable and lightweight I have ever used. The sound quality is as expected from Bose and I got these at a discounted price on Amazon.
My daughter absolutely loves using them she can walk around the apartment and still be connected to the LivingRoom TV. As a parent I love it because I don't have to listen to the TV and my daughter hooked it up to her iPhone and said she loved how easy it was to connect it and the noise cancelation she say was amazing!  Really great buy!
First the good: These headphones live up to Bose reputation for great sound quality. The sound quality and fidelity are great right out of the box. There is no EQ app and no bass boost to color the sound, so you must like what you hear...and it is great fidelity that lives up to the Bose name.  There are headphones at half the price, but these are much better.  You do get what you pay for.I use these for gym workouts and listening to music while my wife watches TV.  There is no noise cancelling but it really isn't needed.  These headphones are the lightest and most comfortable I have ever tried, and I could wear them all day.THE BAD: The reason I gave 4 stars is because the microphone in headphones didn't appear to work.  There seems to be some problem with iPhones and the microphone in the headset where it sounds muffled or low volume to the other caller.  Android phones don't seem to have this problem, so it is not the headphones but the iPhone.  After pairing, you will have to reset both your iPhone and the headphones to forget each other then reconnect via Bluetooth.  It should work fine after that procedure.  You can Google "Bose headphones microphone not working" to find many other users and the solution to this problem.  Bose tech support was no help at all.
If it wasn‚Äôt for my lovely Bose headphones life wouldn‚Äôt be the same because they make the most immeasurable difference for me when I‚Äôm at work by letting me listen to all the music that I love!
I bought these for my 75 yr old dad, whom has PTSD. Loud sounds like thunder storms & fireworks are overwhelming for him. I was looking for something to ease his anxiety from his triggers & mine, from worrying about him when he‚Äôs alone. I wasn‚Äôt sure that he‚Äôd be willing to try them. To my surprise, he loves them so much that he even wears them doing yard work or working in the garage.
My only regret with these headphones so far is that I should have purchased them sooner. They are perfect for air travel; the supplied cable works with airline plugs and is long enough. They hold charge fairly well and recharge quickly. Sound is exceptional, and since they are over-the-ear headphones, they have natural noise-canceling properties. Highly recommend this product.

So this is an update to the review earlier. The price finally dropped again so I purchased it before it went back up, and this time the Bluetooth connection worked. Simple manufacturers defect no biggie... Continuing where I left off from, OMG, they sound absolutely amazing. Phillips has always made beautiful audio products. They have a sound presence that I like, free from unnecessary artificial enhancements. Usually, Headphones in this price bracket typically have some type of artificially generated sound to enhance listening experience.  I'm not going to say those are necessarily bad, because obviously people enjoy them which is why other brands have far higher sales figures. However, there are people like me who actually enjoy the music as written and produced by the artists, and these Philips l3 do just that. The mids the highs and the base are all nicely balanced to deliver rich quality sound and it does that in spades.Where battery life is concerned, I've been playing these things since they were delivered and I'm about halfway battery life after about 8hrs. However, it must be noted that I took these straight out the box, paired em to my phone, and started listening to music right away without charging. So, maybe after a full charge those numbers should go up and get closer to what's listed by the factory.When I read some of the reviews and see people complaining about the type of bass, and complains about the mids or the highs etc. I quickly realize they are comparing the Philips l3 to a brand they are accustomed, and not appreciating the uniqueness and the originality of the sound that the Phillips is presenting them with. If you love Bose headphones and how they sound, then stick with Bose headphones. Same goes for Sony, Beats, Sennheiser and whatever brand you're into. Stop expecting other brands to match the sound that your favorite brand makes, it's just not going to happen.1st Review:Unfortunately, I only had these for about two days before returning. So why 4 stars you ask? Everything you've read about the build quality is true. OMG, they feel sooooo nice. AND, I'm going to buy them again when the price goes back down. I didn't keep my pair because there was an issue with the Bluetooth, and it wouldn't pair with anything in my house. Tried the phones, iPads, my computer, nothing would pair with them.Anyway. Everything you've read about the build quality and robust feel of these headphone is 100% true. They feel indestructible in your hands. The padding material is super comfortable, the head band is perfectly snug and feel so comfortable that I could potentially wear them all day. The packing quality and even the free storage container was top shelf quality. I obviously have nothing to add in the sound quality or playtime as yet, but when I purchase it again, I will update this incomplete review.
These have the most solid and premium build quality of any headphone I've tested in this price range ($200-350). The leather is beautiful and supple, the metal arms seem bombproof, and the plastic used for the earcups is of the highest quality. I love that the leather is used for the earcups, which allows for a cool, very comfortable sensation against the head, as well as the headband. The Fidelio L3 logo is subtly embossed at the center of the headband. The earcups are perfect circles, giving the headphones an elegant and timeless design.In short, I love these headphones.Of course, in this category of high-end ANC headphones, the benchmark is the Sony XM4. I have been testing these Fidelios against my new (Dec 2021) Sony XM4s. In terms of build quality, these L3s *blow the Sony's out of the water.* By comparison, the Sony's feel cheap and like they'll crack at any moment - and, in fact, there are a number of reviewers who have ran into exactly that problem. (Take a look at the numerous images of cracked and useless XM4s on their Amazon page.) The Sony's seem to have a structural weakness at the pivot where the earcup connects to the headband, and too many people for me to feel comfortable with have reported the headphones snapping at that point. Sony customer service refuses to repair or replace these, even if it's within warranty, because they consider it "damage." This has practical consequences; if I want to take a nap with my headphones on, I always choose the Fidelios because the Sony's make me afraid that if I turn on my side and put pressure against the earcup, they will snap. At this price point, Sony should be doing much, much better. My opinion is that Sony has become accustomed to the fact that everyone seems to consider the XM4s the best-in-class, and, as a result, the company has become lazy, seeking to maximize their margins by using cheap plastics, fake leather, and generally neglecting the build quality.Can you imagine dropping $350 on your headphones, only to have them snap on you within a year? That's insane.So, in short, the Fidelios seem to me to offer the best build quality of any headphones in this price range. I think I'll be able to throw them into my bag when I'm rushing off to work or traveling for years to come and not worry about any damage. They are that solid. They are a pleasure to hold and look at.With all of that said, the Fidelios are not as excellent when it comes to the sound and ANC. I can tell that the XM4s have better noise cancelling than the Fidelios. Even worse, I have noticed a very subtle high pitched tone coming from the Fidelios at times, mostly when the volume is up high. I'm still testing to see whether it's a problem with my Bluetooth connection or audio player, but I think it may simply be a defect.The other issue I've noticed is that the mic on the Fidelios hasn't been super clear on my Zoom calls. (I'm on a 2018 Surface 6 Tablet, so that may have something to do with it.) That's a major drawback for me, but it's not an issue when they are plugged in. I also have about 5 or 6 Bluetooth connections going on at the same time and that's caused connectivity issues with the Sony's too, so I need to continue testing once I've reduced the number of Bluetooth connections. When I remove the other Bluetooth connections, I haven't had issues.(In case you run into the same issue, there is a reliable workaround: Get yourself a BT receiver, such as the TP-Link USB Bluetooth Receiver. The issue seems to stem from the BT connections interfering with each other.)This is the first year that the Fidelios have been out and I am confident that with the next iteration, Philips will get better at the ANC. I expect these headphones to quickly overtake the XM4s in the years to come. They just need to develop the audio quality. Philips has phenomenal sound quality on some of its other headphones, such as the open-backed Fidelio X2HRs, which I also love. (The soundstage and overall sound quality on these is noticeably better than the XM4s and Fidelio L3s.) The question is whether the headphone review industry will move on from its fixation on the XM4s, as far as public recognition goes.I highly recommend these headphones, but you will need to test them with your actual use-cases to figure out whether they match what matters most to you.
First of all, let me just say that I got hooked onto the Fidelio line from Philips from the X2s and they were amazing for the money I paid.Then X3 came out and I got a pair too, to compare against my Sennheiser H599. ended up selling the Sennheiser and kept the X3 due to its easy to drive nature, meaning I can listen with the X3 anywhere in the house with my phone.Still not contempt having wires and missing a mic for phone calls, I started looking up L3 when Philips announced it in 2020 but it didn't arrive until September 2021 (time of this review)Well... now being a Fidelio convert, I got the L3 too, pre-ordered and it was delayed getting to me (so sick and tired of covid impacts). So let's get into it!MUSICAL QUALITY (5/5):L3 is a big surprise, in a good way. The audio quality and signature is nothing like that of X3. L3 being closed back 40mm, self-driven. While X3 is open-back 50mm wired.X3 has great soundstage and neutral, transparent in sound quality, quite musical and not overly analytical but everything you want to hear is there without being overblownL3 is different, for the fun of it. It has more bass, while still a bit restrained compared to most wireless headphones. Nothing is overblown,  no M shapes here, yet everything is more distinct than the X3. I would say these remind me a bit of the X2 and what made the X2 fun to listen to.DESIGN & BUILD QUALITY (4.5/5):Amazing design, everything is just subtle and understated. No flashy branding or colors. If you are 35+ years old and want something that looks mature and sophisticated, these fit the requirements perfectly. The design is smart, there is just enough padding and plush there without adding unnecessary bulk and weight. It does weigh more than other wireless headphones I have but then this has a TON more battery life (30+ hours w/ ANC on) than anything I've owned. The earcup ring area is made from a metallic alloy too. It adjusts well and fits my head fine. I have a large flat head that is more circular than oval in shape.I even wore this on a 13-hour flight and slept on my side with it on, didn't feel that much pressure on my ears and it stayed on for most of the flight without feeling fatigued. It is too bad that this doesn't fold inwards though, for a more compact carrying configuration. However, with it folded flat, it is fairly thin in profile that I could put the case into my backpack without adding much bulk.ANC (Active Noise Canceling) PERFORMANCE (4.5/5):I would say it blocked out more than 90% of the noise while I was on the 13-hour trans-pacific flight. It was in an Airbus A350 which is quiet already but the headphones really blocked out most of the engine noise. It has to be turned on in order to drive the drivers properly even when plugged in via a wire source (cable and adapter included). I think it is amazing how far we've come in ANC technology, I could easily watch a movie on a flight without boosting the volume up really high. In fact, I was only 1/3 of the way on volume, it felt something like 70db, enough to enjoy the movie effects.PLUSES:+ Amazing sound quality for wireless headphones, has APTX HD, AAC...etc+ 90 percentile noise canceling performance (rivaling Sony's and beats Bose's QC35ii)+ Sophisticated look, understated design+ Top-notch materials without weighing too much+ Extremely comfortable+ Works well with app controls+ Insane amount of battery lifeNEGATIVES:- Weighs a bit more than plastic headphones- Placement of external mics on the earcups (especially right earcup) is prone to loud jarring sound if I accidentally touch the mic area while trying to use the gesture controls- Overall package a bit bigger and not as compact as Sony's headphones
I am NOT an audiophile, so it's likely my standards are not that high. I always found it insane to pay hundreds (typically $300) for things like "Beats," which, surely, most of that cost goes to profits and "brand name" royalties rather than "tech." I got these on a Prime day special for a bargain, and I'm very pleased with them.
Pros:- Decent price point for the product- Fully covers ears- Comes with a carrying case- Holds a pretty good charge (that being said, I am using these intermittently)- Easily connects to computer Bluetooth (used TP-Link adapter, myself)-Easy to use controls (on each surface and on the sides)-Easy to follow instructional card-Decent sound qualityCons:~ Subpar noise cancellation. This is the biggest draw-back to me using these any more than I already am. They are on par with my Raycons that don‚Äôt have any external noise reduction features. I can hear everything happening in a room. There are 3 controls for noise cancellation: going from NC to awareness OR off makes you feel like you‚Äôre underwater and there is no discernible difference in noise cancellation between these three very different settings. When compared to something like an AirPod Pro, it‚Äôs not even in the same league.~Uncomfortable on head. These squeeze a little too tightly and when they‚Äôre shaped, they don‚Äôt hold the shape super well. Other headphones/headsets I‚Äôve had over the years will hold a shape after a few days, but these just won‚Äôt budge.Overall, these are an average set of headphones. I don‚Äôt personally see anything special about them. If you‚Äôre trying to get a pair of headphones solely for the noise cancelling feature, I recommend not getting these. Otherwise, they‚Äôre alright.
I like these headphones a lot - great controls, easy and comfortable to wear, sound good, good mic, solid battery life.The noise canceling is only okay. Don't get me wrong, it is a big improvement over my regular earbuds, but I feel like too much of the noise canceling is based solely on the fact that these are over ear headphones. Toggling the ANC on and off doesn't make a huge difference.But still 4 stars. I'm not mad I bought them!
These quality ear phones are very comfortable. I've only used them a few times and I am quite happy with them the noise filtration is excellent. Well worth the money.
These are fine for letting folks know you‚Äôre listening to something else. Or if your ear buds have a tendency to drop out and roll under the seat when traveling. Or worse. This headset it comfortable enough, folds up nice and flat for stage, and is easy to connect via Bluetooth or enclosed audio cable. At this price point, though, you‚Äôre not going to get noticeable noise canceling. The audio quality is nice enough to turn up and mask some street noise, but it‚Äôs still there. If you need true noise canceling, pony up for Bose.
Noise cancellation works well and the sound quality is quite good.  The app is very useful with an EQ and the ability to control the noise cancellation.
I am happy with the half off price (bought on Amazon day)They are not the most comfortable but also not the worst.My ears get moist after long use. The sound quality is decent but not a lot of bass.Batteries last a long time.Overall I am happy with them.

My road to the Sennheiser HD 600's has been a little long and filled with some interesting twists and turns that have, or so I hope, led me to a better understanding of what are a great set of headphones.  Naturally it is very typical to wish to compare these to other headphones.  After all, isn't that how we so often make purchasing decisions?  We try differing products until we find the one which works best/right for our needs.  So my review is going to work on two fronts:  a review of the product itself, and a review against some competitors I have acquired in the last year in my quest to find headphones that are right for me.  And hopefully for you.Regarding the HD600's themselves I have mostly nothing but excellent news to report.  Personally, I like the way they look.  The mottled black and blue coloring is different, but not garish in any way.  The large and deep oval ear cups are precisely what one wants for an over-the-ear design.  At 6'4" I'm certainly sporting a larger head than the average male and fortunately for me my entire ears fit comfortably inside the ear cups.  My ears do not touch the protective cloth over the drivers, but the outer edge of my ear does touch at places around the inside of the ear cup.  This is a minor annoyance and goes unnoticed some of the time. Those of you more average of height and head size will likely never have this issue.  The ear cups themselves are very comfortable, seal well to my head and do not get hot even after a good number of hours of use.  This also means the head clamping  force is perfect for me; I never feel like my head is being squeezed.  Everything about the headphones seems to indicate they are well-made, but I cannot help but feel the plastic seems a bit thin.  Maybe cheap even.  They do not creak and nothing flexes, but it's the only part which lets me down at all about the headphones.The included box, while awesome for storage, is clearly not oriented for travel.  But I would argue these aren't portable headphones meant for the on-the-go user.  They do not fold up.  The ear cups do not turn to lay flat.  And considering the amplification needed to properly drive these, using a typical portable music player (your cell phone, iPod, etc.) isn't ideal anyway.Now for what I consider to be the more important part of how I came to select the HD600: research and listening.  Let's first be clear about something... audio equipment is not unlike some other equipment markets in that you often spend exponentially more money for an item just to gain minor, incremental increases in some important criteria.  To you speaker X sounds better than speaker Y, all other things being equal.  It's likely speaker X costs more.  Most of the time it will cost more, but not all of the time.  But how much more does it cost and how much more quality of sound are you receiving for that additional cost?  It's almost always a matter of diminishing returns... loads more money for a bit firmer bass or slightly clearer treble.  But this is the nirvana for which we seek in audio equipment.Over the last year I purchased two other sets of headphones:  Grado 80e and Sennheiser Momentum.  Clearly the Grado's at $100 are the least expensive with the Momentum jumping up markedly to $299, while the more recently acquired Sennheiser HD600 hit the $400 mark.  Comparing my first two purchases, the 80e's and Momentum's, the differences were pretty straight-forwarded.  To me the Grado's sounded brighter with good bass and sligthly harsh mids ("smeared" is the word which came to mind as I compared them in listening tests at home).  The Mometum's sounded more laid back (not as bright) with great bass (that could be a bit smeared itself in the upper bass) and definitely superior mids (thinking men's voices here - became painfully obvious will using a live track from Morrissey between the two headphones).  And so it was I came to find myself using each pair for different purposes.The Grado 80e's became my preferred can for classical music (a genre into which I am becoming more deeply involved of late) as I felt, for my personal preferences, the brighter qualities enhanced the instruments typical of classical music, while the bass was more than sufficient.  But when I wanted to rock (or alternative as is more often the case) I broke out the Momentum's.  The accentuated, but not overblown bass, was quite welcome and I noticed less the laid back nature of the treble, especially as I used them more and more.But with the also recent purchase of some better home audio equipment (Marantz CD6005 CD player and a SoundEngine D1 DAC/Headphone amp for my computer - listening to ALAC encoded tracks) I found myself thinking both the Momentum and 80e were somehow lacking.  That I wasn't getting everything I could from my music via this better equipment.From all the research I had done previously I elected to spend the money and purchase the HD600.  I don't think I have found a single bad review out there in the Internet sphere.  A few have thought them a little warm or laid back.  But most every review hits upon how, and especially for the money, the HD600s hit all the right notes (sorry).  Having had them burned in for 30-hours the listening tests began.  I had considered this purchase principally for classical music.  I really didn't think I'd get more from them for rock/alternative than I was already getting from the Momentums and so it was the classical CDs came out and I plugged into the CD player.  I also plugged in the Grados to the Marantz A/V receiver, direct mode engaged.  Adjusting for volume as best I could (this is hardly scientific) I played a handful of very familiar tracks from very familiar CDs; swapping back and forth between the HD600s and Grado 80e.It too almost no time to hear the difference.  I'll concede that it's sometimes difficult to put into words the differences heard, but I'll try.  The first thing I noticed were the violins.  When a number of them are playing notes together the Grado's sounded smeared compared to the HD600s.  Not unlike a poorly created JPEG from a digital point-n-shoot versus a well-made JPEG from an original RAW processed via Adobe Lightroom.  Details are are lost in the former, but the latter does a far superior job of keeping the detail even in the process of losing information.  The HD600 left me feeling like I was actually sitting there in the room with the musicians.  I'm not referring to placement of the instruments (the HD600 do a good job, but I've read reviews for other cans that do better), but simply how clear, precise, concise and live-sounding are the violins.  Actually, it was true of all the stringed instruments.  The resonance of the strings... their very clear nature... was a welcome and astonishing difference.Granted, the Grado's are one-quarter the cost and I shouldn't be surprised the HD600's sounded better.  Markedly better.  And I didn't have to listen long or hard to notice the differences.  They are obvious; not subtle.  That said, I can't say I was every displeased with the Grado's.  It was only in comparison to the HD600's that it became possible to hear and understand the Grado's limitations.And like the stringed instruments, voices also became sharper, clearer, more focused.  I had found what I was looking for regarding my classical music interests: a pair of headphones that while generally neutral (which some would consider to be 'flat' and flat has, I think, a negative connotation), are not at all boring or flat.  I feel the music is more alive than ever in comparison to the Grado's.So... I also broke out some rock and alternative music (the recently remastered Led Zeppelin discs, some Nine Inch Nails and Pet Shop Boys) to see what the HD600's could do.  Here I feared the Momentum would just kick butt thanks to the fuller bass, but I must say the HD600's continued to impress.  All the good things they brought to mid and higher frequencies (clarity, precision) were still present, but, surprisingly, the bass was rock solid as well. I may hate myself for saying it, but I think the bass was a bit better.  The upper-bass bloat in the Momentum's doesn't appear on the HD600's, which tends to make the lower-bass stand out more because they aren't overwhelmed by the enhanced upper-bass.  I'd still say the Momentum's have more punch and who doesn't like that when listening to rock or alternative, but I could find myself readily using the HD600's just as often for The Smiths, The Cure, Skinny Puppy, etc. as I would the Momentum's.And here I think I have found a most excellent trio of headphones.  Finding one perfect pair of headphones for all needs and opportunities is probably impossible.  But I think I have accidentally stumbled upon a most excellent hat trick of cans that meet my various needs.  I like to listen to music when I'm on the go; I have needs for portability.  And while not truly the most portable of headphones, the Grado's for classical (and still quite reasonable for rock and alternative) and the Momentum's for rock and alternative (I confess I don't like them as much for classical as I do the Grado's for rock and alternative), AND the HD600's for more critical, at-home listening with audio equipment that has enough amplifier ooomph to properly push them.Add my name and voice to the long list of of folks who think, dollar for dollar, the Sennheiser HD600 are the best value in headphones out there.
It's easy to forget that, next year, the HD 600 will turn 20 years old. Admittedly, audio transducers have a funny way of sticking around longer than just about any other piece of electronics equipment. A line of speakers will, usually, be in production for at least several years. Even when they've been replaced, they usually aren't even close to obsolete, because even mid-fi has gotten pretty far into diminishing returns. But, even in this alternate timeline of audiophile-dom (others might call it an alternate reality, an insane asylum...) the HD 600s are freakin ancient. I can only think of a few other cans with this kind of longevity:The Sony MDR-V6; so old that it still has "for DIGITAL" emblazoned on the side. A quick trip through audio theory will reveal that this is meaningless, but in 1985 it sounded really cool.The Beyerdynamic DT770/880/990; so old that they still have shag carpet earpads.Various Grados; so old that it's too late for anybody to admit they sound like trash. Instead, they just mumble something about "sparkle" and then go buy something else.And yet, 20 years later, the HD600 is still the headphone that, within headphone circles, everybody talks about and everybody has heard. There's a reason for that: it's not just really good. Purely on the strength of its sound, it stands out as excellent. When price is considered? It might just be the best headphone in the world.THE SOUND:Inevitably, whenever anyone tries to talk about the HD600 or the HD650, someone brings up the "Sennheiser Veil." This so-called veil was a kind of muffling of the sound, and the people who complain about it would have you believe that the HD6XX sounds like Apple Earpods.I cannot state emphatically enough how much the veil does not exist. It is either a product of the imagination of people who wish the AKG K701 was a bit brighter, or the result of people trying to plug the HD6XX straight into an inadequate source, i.e. most phones, MP3 players, iPods, laptops, etc. They need an amp. More on that later. At any rate, these headphones are as veiled as Eva Green in The Dreamers. You. Will. See. erm, Hear. Everything.That's both a blessing and a curse. Lesser headphones - even my Sony MDR-V6s, for instance - can mask the flaws in a bad recording. All of those 128kbps MP3s you've pirated because you're a bad person? They're gonna sound awful. If your father-in-law-to-be hands sends you some recordings of his garage band, grab however awful a set of backup cans you need for it to sound good. Because these will tell you the truth. Yet, to a good recording, they are shockingly flattering. If you put garbage in, you'll get garbage out. Give it something good, though, and you'll get magic. I've listened to just about my entire music library with these, and there are a few recordings in particular that really demonstrate how well these shine:-In the Air Tonight (Phil Collins, Face Value, 1981): On a decent-to-good set of headphones, this song sounds ominous; it sounds cool. Whatever. On the HD600s, it's a religious experience. Sounds swirl around your head. The crescendos and diminuendos blow you away. The vocals sound perfect. Incredible.-In Your Eyes (Peter Gabriel, So, 1986): The entire album is fabulous. Listen to it over and over again. But there's a reason this song is singled out. It's a sibilance nightmare. On my MDR-V6s, it's unlistenable above a moderate volume. Enter the HD600s: there's no hiding how much sibilance there is, but they handle it as gracefully as possible.Enough ink has been spilled over how these handle classical and jazz (spoiler: fabulously), and their vocal presentation in particular is spot-on.THE STUFF YOU'LL NEED:To get all of this brilliant sound, you're going to need a few things. First and foremost is an amp. This can get crazy pretty quick, so first let's draw a distinction: solid state vs tubes. The HD600 has a high enough impedance to really get along with OTL amps (ie, most headphone tube amps). This will color the sound somewhat, get hot, be unreliable, need to warm up, etc. If you want to go down this road, you can. There's also a lot of really expensive solid state amps.Or, you could just get a Schiit Magni or a JDS Objective2, both of which sound... well... about perfect.Next, you'll need to think about a DAC. Now, a lot of people just assume they'll need one. That may not be the case. If you have a Retina Macbook Pro, for instance, skip it. You'll never hear the difference between it and whatever you get for 150 bucks. Same deal if you're plugging a (good) CD player or receiver or whatever straight into the amp. If your source is something else, like a midrange PC, you'll need to evaluate this yourself. Unfortunately, I can't help you with that.If you decide you need a DAC, there are a lot of expensive options out there.Or, you could just get a Schiit Modi or a JDS ODAC, both of which sound... well... about perfect.(Side lesson: The internet audiophile community fights back and forth all the time about whether the O2/ODAC or the Magni/Modi is the better setup. Realistically, their performance is nearly identical. Buy whichever you think looks better.)(Another side lesson: You seriously probably don't need to spend a ton of money on DACs and amps. The O2/ODAC was designed by some wacky internet crusader who wanted to prove that the performance of the Benchmark DAC2 and HPA2 could be achieved without spending thousands of dollars. From an engineering perspective, this is obviously possible. If you look into this further, you will still find people who insist that the O2/ODAC doesn't sound as good as significantly more expensive gear. Just remember that these are audiophile crazies, who think they need 192kHz recordings because Nyquist-Shannon doesn't apply to special snowflakes. The two most important things in any digital-to-analog system are the input file and the transducer.)Finally, you're going to need good recordings. iTunes is sufficient. Vinyl is pretty good (repeat after me: vinyl does not sound better than CD, it is objectively worse, a record will only sound great 25 times, and will be the equal of the CD never). CD is your best bet, particularly those mastered before the "loudness wars" started up in the late 1990s. However, the world isn't perfect; fear not, the Senns still sound good with stuff that has a compressed dynamic range (within reason). Anything beyond the Redbook CD standard is simply a ploy to get you to spend more money for things you can't hear, and that your dog can't either.SOME REALITIES:The way that the Senns achieve all this great sound is by being "open-back" headphones. This means that, on the side of the driver opposite your ear, there's just some mesh to protect it from damage. This means that you can't really use these outside a quiet environment, because you'll hear everything around you. It also means that you probably won't want to listen to them in public, because it's really difficult to look cool when everybody knows you're blasting the Bangles.Also, they're ugly as sin. But they aren't leaving your house, so who cares?A WORD ABOUT THE HD650:Released several years after the HD600, the HD650 at first glance looks like an upgrade. That... depends. The HD650 is darker and smoother at the expense of detail. That's all. I prefer its sound signature. But, it usually costs between 75 and 150 dollars more than the HD600, and so it wasn't worth it for me. It probably isn't worth it for you, either.So, yeah. These headphones sound just about dead neutral, wonderfully crisp, and yet smooth enough that you can listen at high volumes without fatigue. They can usually be had for less than 300 dollars. And for the price, they have no equal. Now we just have to hope that someday the HD800S can be such an easy decision to make.
These headphones are pretty much the standard for this price range, and excellent if you want to explore more detail in what you listen to.They are open-backed headphones, which means you can hear outside noise with them on more easily than normal closed-back headphones or earbuds with a rubber seal. (This is why I didn't rate it's noise cancelling, as that isn't something these try to achieve) It also means that they have a very wide soundstage. It's hard to describe if you're not into audio, but basically it feels less like the sound is coming from speakers right next to your ears and more like you're in a room with the music playing.The sound is remarkably balanced, meaning most frequencies are emitted by the speakers at about the same volume. Being open backed headphones, the subbase tapers off a bit at the end, but is still very easy to hear. These shine when listening to music of all sorts, but particularly big-band jazz and orchestra. That being said, when listening to hip hop or rock or something, I find myself picking out much more detail than with something like my Bose QC45s (which are great in their own way)So what's the catch? You will need to have something a little more powerful than a normal computer audio jack to drive these headphones. I use mine with a Moto M2 USB audio interface, which is great because you can also run monitors and two xlr mics with phantom power at the same time. These aren't cheap but are about best bang for your buck if you want to record as well. Otherwise, you can probably fine a USB headphone preamp to run these.Overall these are excellent headphones for just about anything. They are my daily drivers for literally everything I do at my desk
Well this is the first real pair of headphones I've owned. Previously I wasn't too serious about headphones and had purchased some SOL Republics over-the-ear headphones. There was a customer service guy that recommended them among others like Skullcandy and other sub $150 non-audiophile headphones saying that "All these headphones are pretty good, just don't buy Beats or your just paying for the name". Well at the time I thought the Republics sounded good for music like Rage Against the Machine. But after I purchased some quality NHT Superzero bookshelf speakers for my office I noticed that the headphones were completely missing the higher frequencies. Boosting the Highs on an Equalizer helped but it still had a muddy sound to them. So I decided to try some more serious higher priced headphones and see what happens.I already had a decent Peachtree Audio Integrated Amp/DAC with headphone amp to test them. So as I sat in front of my bookshelf speakers, I plugged them into the headphone amp. I wasn't that blown away thinking the HD 600s sounded slightly better than my other headphones but certainly not worth the extra $250 Dollars. However I noticed right away details in music that I'd never noticed before. Like clearly hearing the squeaking chair of a producer at the beginning of The WHO's 'Don't get Fooled Again'.  I let them keep playing music and burn themselves in while I did something else for about 4 hours. When I came back the bass response was noticeably better and sound was slightly improved but still felt it was not that great of an improvement.Then I had an major facepalm moment when I realized I was comparing these headphones to my bookshelf speakers. They sounded so much like them that I didn't even realize that I had the memory of the bookshelves sound in my head and not the other headphones. I had been listening allot to my main speakers and not much to my other headphones so that must be why. Needless to say I was pretty impressed when I realized my error. Kind of hate to admit that they sound a little better than my main speakers. The bookshelfs have a slightly darker sound and have a somewhat boosted bass by default that I don't care for. So then I compared the actual other headphones and as I expected muddy bass, missing highs and mediocre at best sound. The other headphones also had a very noticeable noise floor. On the HD 600s there is absolutely NONE! Any background noise you notice through the headphones is either due to the recording itself or the source your hooking it up to. This is great because you can listen to music at low volumes and still clearly hear the music without fuzzy noise interfering.I was surprised also that my phone was even able to drive these headphones to a respectable medium volume. I expected the volume to be allot lower considering the 300 Ohms rating. However you need an amp to get loud enough to get the full details of the music and the phones amp doesn't have the separation of instruments like my home headphone amp. The Bass and Treble don't fully emerge until you get to a loud volume and I mean LOUD. These can be fatiguing if you want to hear all the details of the music because I find the volume has to be fairly loud to reach 100% potential. Just listen to these at medium volumes compared to loud volumes and you will be shocked. There is a sweet-spot with these headphones for sure. It is great for easy listening 'classical' music, acoustic with vocals, symphonies, light rock etc. People saying the bass is too light on these have got to be kidding. I use a Peachtree Audio Amp and DAC which is considered to be neutral by many and at louds volumes it can be a little overbearing on bass-heavy songs. At low volumes I'd agree that the bass is a little light but so is the treble. It has a good punch without taking over and overwhelming your ears. Not flat in anyway whatsoever.Definitely find Open headphones to sound better without the boxed-in sound of a closed headphone. Yes you can't use them in a quiet room when someone is sitting next to you. But what I like is that you can still somewhat hear what is going on around you if you are not listening at too loud of a volume. I'm a mail carrier that cases mail for hours a day before delivering. So at work I can listen to music at low volumes without someone having to throw something at me to get my attention. I much prefer it to closed headphones in situations like these where you are not concerned about critically listening and just want some background music to pass the time. These headphones are also very comfortable and feels like your wearing earmuffs when they are on. My entire ear fits in the headphone without touching the sides of the enclosure, so rarely get soar even after several hours of use. They clamp a bit tight on your head at first but eventually get stretched out and loosen up over time.Not a fan of the headphone cable that comes with the HD600. After only one week of use and trying to be careful, the headphone signal was cutting out when I flexed the cable. The cable is so thin and cheap and not deserving of these high quality cans. I'm not one of those people that says cable will change the audio quality but it has to at least be built well enough to withstand normal wear and tear. I upgraded to the HD 650 cables which are almost twice as thick and much more respectable. Although it has a 1/4" plug instead of the 3.5mm plug from the original cable, so you need an adapter for that too. Be prepared to spend about another $25 dollars though on top of your $400 dollar investment(Much cheaper now I guess). I almost wanted to dock a star just for the poor cable but ultimately it's one speedbump in a field of positives.These headphones can't match the physical feeling of sound vibrations hitting your body from big speakers. However the big speakers can't match the detail the HD 600s give you being right next to your ears either. Unlike stereo systems with subwoofers needing room equalization and treatment, all you have to do it is put these headphones on for near perfect sound. There is no boominess to the bass and it's very fast and tight. The bass is not overpowering and just right. While the Highs sound very crisp and detailed. Vocals are very lifelike. Nora Jones has never sounded better.Last but not least these are made in Ireland! Good to know there are still SOME electronics not being made in China. I have no problem paying a premium for something that wasn't made in a sweatshop. You don't need to spend $1,000+ dollars on an Amp/Dac to reach these phones potential despite what people tell you. I use an Objective2Amp/DAC Combo that has really low distortion and doesn't color the sound like many Amps Do and it sounds brilliant. I'm not someone that buys new headphones every month and was looking for a great headphone that would last several years. Hopefully this is the one. :)1/26 Update: I've discovered after listening to these for awhile that I was actually pushing these headphones too loud. Apparently these headphones are EQed for a more distant mellower sound instead of being loud and in-your-face like headphones I was used to in the past. The bass was not strong until I had the volume very loud and then the treble was almost ear piercing. But if I listen at more moderate volumes the bass is not quite as present but blends with with treble perfectly. There seems to be a pretty small window for the volume not being loud enough, to being to loud to get a full clear sound. The default flat settings are not really suited for music with electric guitar as it sounds a bit faint. It's more for relaxed listening when your browsing webpages on your computer or just listening to musical instruments/vocals. Which is Ok with me but thought I'd tell others so they should know what to expect. You'll just need to change Equalizer settings if you want a more aggressive neutral sound. I like switching between the default warm sound and more bright sound depending on the music.
I've had my Sennheiser HD600 headphones for 20 years [Amazon, Feb. 2002]. They have outlived 3 desktop headphone amps and every other piece of electronics I have ever owned (except my beloved Sota turntable).To be honest, early on I added aftermarket cable [Stefan Audioart SE], so my affection for these phones is certainly biased. All the praise for these is true, so I won't get repetitious.I currently substituted an entry level balanced cable [NewFantasia, Amazon, $48] to experiment using these headphones in a MacBook Pro/Fiio q1II combination with sparkling results. There is more than enough headroom to drive this 300ohm beast at safely loud levels.Saving up for "real" (& expensive) audiophile balanced cable.Just looked the phones over and no dents or scratches, even after all this time/use [YMMV].Finally, you might just want to be buried/cremated wearing these...PS _Don't be a jerk like I was and loose some of your hearing playing these at very high volume - they can take it, your ears can't.
As a studio engineer and producer, I've been wanting to buy these headphones for at least several years.  However I put off purchasing them in favor of getting other less expensive headphones.I ended up with some Avantone MP1 headphones and some Senn DT-990 to help with mixing.  I already had some Sony 7506 and Audio Technica MTH-M50 for recording.Well I'm here to tell you, the HD-600 sounds the absolute best and flattest of ALL my head sets!  Whatever adjustments or changes I make on the HD600 is exactly how it comes out on my studio monitors. It's almost a 1 to 1 translation.  This is very important for mixing because you want to make sure that what you do in the studio translates to the real world (other people's listening systems).My other headphones all seem to have various sound profiles which doesn't exactly produce a good 1 to 1 translation.  For the instance the 7506 is bright, the M50 is more dark & bassy, MP-1 has balance but is not very detailed or lacks depth compared to the HD600.Although I do like how the DT990 sounds, however, I tend to trust the HD600 more. the HD600 sound profile  makes it particularly accurate and detailed if I'm mixing or doing sound editing.  The 990 does have more bass however, so it can be useful for checking the lower levels of the bass regions in a mix.At the end of the day, if you do any mixing or editing, the HD600 is well worth the price. I wish i wouldn't have waited so long to get one.  So if you're on the fence about it like I was, just trust me and get it now!!  You can thank me later :-)
If you're reading this, you're deep enough into the audio hobby to have realized an important psychological truth about yourself: you can't leave well enough alone. Neither can I. That's why, even after falling head over heels in love with the sound of the HD650, I ordered the HD600. I just had to know.The verdict? It's almost too close to call, but for my preferences the 650 is the better headphone. The two have been compared to death online, but if you have the capacity to think for yourself, audio review sites and forums are usually an unsavory if fascinating combination of shilling, self-justification, and "follow the leader" parroting of received opinions. Many self-proclaimed "audiophiles" have strong opinions about equipment they've never actually heard, which I can't accept.Given that, I decided the only way to compare the two headphones honestly was to listen to both myself for hours, going back and forth on a wide variety of recordings. The difference between a good recording and a bad recording dwarfs the difference between lossy and lossless, and the HD600 (more so than the HD650) may end up changing your taste in music because it makes good recordings sound SO GOOD and bad recordings sound SO BAD. In other words, it reveals the "truth" of the recording, and sometimes the truth hurts‚Äîit's really hard to enjoy The Killers now.The fact is that the 600 and 650 are ultimately more alike than different, and the popular insistence that they sound completely different has more to do with what Freud called "the narcissism of small differences" than the headphones themselves. If you Google some variation on "HD650 vs HD600," you'll hear over and over that the 650 is "bassier" or "darker." Not really. There's actually very little difference across this parameter. Piano music presents an exception, but this is rarely what people think of as a bassy genre.There are two significant differences. The first is soundstage. The HD650's soundstage is wider, but that doesn't mean it can make a cramped recording sound airy. The HD600's soundstage is more intimate; there's less space between left and right channels, but it's not a huge difference, and I could see people preferring (or at least not minding) the HD600's tighter spacing.The most striking difference between the two headphones is in what I'd call "smoothness." The best analogy I can think of comes from digital photography. As an image sensor increases its sensitivity, it also increases its noise because you can't amplify a signal without also amplifying noise. There are two rival philosophies for dealing with noise: leave it as "grain" or smooth it out. Grain has its devotees, and the advantage of grain is that it preserves fine detail. The disadvantage is that past a certain point it becomes a distraction. The advantage of smoothness, meanwhile, is that it looks superficially nicer. The disadvantage is that when you look closely you won't see all the fine details. Like all things, it's a continuum of compromise. The 600 is the headphone to get if you value detail at the cost of an occasionally unpleasant grainy and even metallic quality to the sound. The 650 is the one to get if you care more about music than sound and don't care if your headphones sand down the sharp edges of your music a bit.Going back and forth between the two, it quickly becomes clear that the 650 is the stronger all-around performer: it sounds nicer on more recordings and across more genres. The 600, meanwhile, is the champion of a particular niche: good recordings with lots of micro detail. Want to be able to count how many times the skin of a drum reverberates after it's struck? Want to hear such fine vocal gradations you'll know how a singer felt during recording? The 600 is for you.Make no mistake: at its best, the 600 produces the most astonishingly detailed sound I've ever heard. Unfortunately, at its worst it sounds grainy, jumbled, and not particularly musical. I'm sorry to report that piano music sounds particularly off on the 600: low frequencies disappear and take the fullness of the keys with them. Vocals can sound oddly recessed, even far away. In general, the 600 seems to fare better with female vocals than male ones, and with strings over pianos. It's absolutely glorious for acoustic guitar, but then, so is the 650.The 650's great advantage lies in its ability to bring out vocals like a spotlight. They stand out so clearly and powerfully from the instrumentation that you'll feel like you're hearing your favorite songs for the first time. The effect is really quite incredible: it's like there's a special sonic space reserved for vocals and unpolluted by other sounds. Based on Sennheiser's own specs, the 650 has lower distortion than the 600 and it's clearly a more refined driver unit. Whatever the technical reason, the 650's background is pitch black: sounds rise from and fall back into a sea of silence. Be forewarned: a well-recorded vocal track through the 650 may bring tears to your eyes, and that's why I kept the 650 and returned the 600.Finally, let's talk about measurements. While there's a valid SUBJECTIVE argument for preferring the sound of the 600, the 650 has an objectively better driver that improves on its predecessor in every way: higher sensitivity, lower distortion, and better power handling. Here are the figures straight from Sennheiser's manuals, which you can find for yourself on the product pages for both headphones at bhphotovideo[dot]com. The terminology used isn't consistent from one manual to the other, but the parameters in question are the same. I've noted these variations where applicable.Frequency response (-10db): 12 ‚Äì 38,000 Hz (HD600), 10 ‚Äì 39,500 Hz (HD650)Impedance: 300 ÔÅóohms (same for both)Sensitivity/"Loudness" (Sennheiser also calls this "Sound pressure level at 1 kHz"): 97 dB (HD600), 103 dB (HD650)Load rating (Sennheiser also calls this "Long-term max. input power"): 0.2W aka 200mW (HD600), 500mW (HD650)THD (Total Harmonic Distortion): ‚â§0.1% (HD600), ‚â§0.05% (HD650)In short, the HD650 will get louder than the 600 because it has higher sensitivity at the same resistance. The fact that it can handle almost twice as much INPUT power is a positive, not a negative; if you turned a decent amp ALL THE WAY UP with the HD600 connected, you could damage or even destroy the drivers. The 650 has enough headroom for more than twice as much input power, but there's little point in driving your headphones loud enough for permanent hearing loss.At the end of the day, headphone preference, like any preference, is primarily subjective, and I can't seriously imagine anyone being unhappy with the HD600.
Tried so many headphones over the years, but keep coming back to the Sennheiser HD600. By far my favorite! Serious base, melodius mid tones, and crisp highs. If you are playing from your PC or mobile device you will need a decent DAC/Amp to drive them as the 300ohm impedance needs some power to make them work their best (I am using the FiiO K5Pro and very happy with it)
I just got these, and am breaking them in. They sounds excellent. I have a pair of ported headphones that are also very good, but I want to start doing some home production. I love both sets of headphones. These do not cancel or block noise at all, but I didn't buy them for that. My ported headphones have a little more punch on the bottom end (very little), but these have a wider sound stage. I'm really enjoying them.
This thing is AMAZING! I've never experienced something similar.I've been using Bose Q35 Bluetooth for 3 years, and I love it on a daily basis; then I bought the Sennheiser Massdrop 6xx at the beginning of this year; amazing sound, 30-50% better than the Q3. HD600 was a great upgrade, 20-50% better than 6xx. The sound is more clear. I'm using it along with a Fiio Q3 amplifier/DAC. My next (and final) upgrade will be the HD800S, but it will take some time.

These headphones had great noise cancelling ability! BUT it created an unbearable cabin pressure feeling in my ears. I've had other brands of ANC headphones, and never felt it as extreme as these. It was super uncomfortable no matter what was playing, gave me a headache, and also made me nauseous. So I returned and decided to get the newest version of the brand I liked, Soundcore.I heard this is common for people with sensitive ears, due to how ANC tech works - using "anti-noise waves" to cancel out low frequencies, which can trick your brain into thinking the air pressure has changed. If you're not sensitive to those sound waves, these headphones would be great for you!
The first thing I noticed when I put on these headphones was how good the Active Noise Canceling is. I never realized how much I needed ANC until I put these on. My spouse and I are gamers and have a smallish office that we have both our computers in. We also don't have central air, so we have a small window AC unit in here. With all the PC equipment and the AC, there was a lot of background noise that I've just been filtering out with my brain or with high volume on the headphones.When my Skullcandy Hesh headphones got to the point where the 3.55 jack could no longer connect properly with any cord, I finally switched to bluetooth headphones, using the ones I used with my phones at first‚ÄîSkullcandy Push and some Vivitar over-the-ears I picked up from Target for $10. The Vivitars had good battery life, but the Pushes had good noise canceling from just being in-the-ear. After a month of this, I realized I needed something better, some ANC.I looked around, looked at pricing, looked at reviews, looked at many other brands just to hopefully find a good deal. There was always some dealbreaker. Slow charge. Expensive. Good battery life as long as you don't use ANC. I held off on looking at any other Skullcandy because, as I'm sure you've guessed, I've been a bit of a brand loyalist and I wanted to make sure I wasn't favoring Skullcandy just because it was Skullcandy.Let me tell you, I favor Skullcandy because they actually deliver. I started buying them decades ago, because their earbuds were cheap and reliable. I bought the Hesh because they were less expensive than the other headphones on display yet sounded better. I got the push because they actually fit my ears and don't feel like they're so heavy they'll fall out.The Venues look and feel extremely comfortable. They stay on my head even with rapid movement and don't need to rest on the top of my head. My Vivitars had a small headband that would touch my scalp and, after shaving the sides of my head, I found had actually been giving me contact dermatitis (aka a rash). The Venue headband doesn't need to touch my scalp at all to stay on. My scalp and mohawk are safe.I got the Venues because reviews said the ANC was great‚Äîand it is. I can game in the same room as my spouse and hear him clearly over the voice chat without hearing him in the same room. Even with no sound playing, the ANC still makes it calm and quiet in the room. I'm tempted to start wearing these while I'm out just to have the ANC on normal outside sounds.I got the Venues because reviews said the battery life was great‚Äîand it is. They arrived with no charge, but got enough charge in 10 minutes for me to use them with ANC for the rest of the night, which was about 5-6 hours of gaming with ANC on. I was using two headphones previously when I switched to bluetooth because the Push battery life is only about 4 hours and I would use the Vivitar while waiting for them to recharge. The Venues hold enough battery life on a full charge for me to use them all day while working from home, and then gaming for the night, all with ANC on and not needing to plug them back in at all.Let me repeat this important point: The Venues last ALL DAY with a full charge, and in the event that they do run out, they will charge sufficiently in TEN MINUTES. And if you can't charge, there's still a 3.55mm jack for your audio.There are other features of the Venue that I have not tried because they are not of interest to me (such as Skullcandy's partnering with Tile for locating devices, the hands-free call & assistant integration, etc). I use these headphones as my primary PC headphones, not with my smartphone, so I can't comment on any of the smartphone integration features.
The ONLY real gripe I have is that in the Gym the Headband part slips a lot as do the Ear Bud part.  Not sure what the material is, PU?, but it will slip when you get into your workout and start sweating.... Small Stuff.  Overall not the greatest battery life BUT very good sound quality and the features work as advertised.  JP
I bought these for my 14 hour flight to Japan in 2020. Then COVID hit and that never happened, but I have used these in many situations since. They've held up very well and still work flawlessly. The noise cancelling isn't the greatest, but for this price is probably good. Worth picking up on sale for sure. The battery has never died on me, even through days of using these for my job mowing at a golf course with noise cancelling turned on. Audio quality is pretty good but noise cancelling emits a high pitched sound that can be annoying if you're not playing any music or podcasts. The music quality sounds better with ANC turned off, and still does a good job of blocking lesser noises. The feature that lets you listen to the outside world is really nice, I just wish it didn't make my music so quiet. Noise cancelling helps when flying but if you're expecting these to remove the sound of an airplane you will be sorely disappointed. It just makes it a little less loud and a bit more bearable. They can get tiring on the ears after a while, but as far as headphones go are pretty comfortable.
First this is an honest review from a regular old everyday guy. No one paid me or gave me free headphones. Period.I tested the Skullcandy Venue headphones side by side against the Bose QuietComfort 35 II headphones. Here are my impressions:Sound Quality. Much to my surprise I actually found the Venue's to sound better than the Bose', at least to my ear. The Venue's have a much rounder and more full tone and comparatively the Bose sounded a little thin so I give the edge to Venue on this one.Noise Cancelling. This one was close, again much to my surprise. Both headsets were able to do a good job rejecting outside noise. Although the Venue's had a very slight white noise with ANC on and no music playing but not enough to put me off. However the Bose' have an additional feature of a high and low ANC setting which could be useful depending on the environment that you are using then in. Slight advantage Bose on this one.Comfort. The weight of both headphones are within 4/100 of a Lb. (yes I weighed them) so weight is not an issue. The Venue headphones fit a little tighter and snugger around the ear which makes for a good seal but might be a little less comfortable during periods of long use or if you have a large head. On the other hand the Bose are just the opposite they have more head strap room than anyone could ever use and the cans are much bigger than the average ear. This provides some short term comfort but if you move your head quickly they can actually move around on your head. I'm calling this one a tie because this is just personal preference.Build Quality. First Impression is that Bose has a higher quality. Theirs include some metal alloy where the Venue's are almost completely plastic. I found the Venue's to be sturdy feeling and was not put off by the look or feel. I have to give the advantage to Bose here.User Experience. Bose includes no user manual in the packaging and basically requires you to download and install their proprietary app in order to set up and learn how to use their headphones. This offers the benefit of assigning a virtual assistant to a button. This is helpful if you use Alexa or Google but not if you use Siri because it comes pre-assigned. I found the app an unnecessary hassle with little benefit. Venue's on the other hand come with easy instructions and clear easy to use function buttons. Advantage Venue on this one.Value. In the end, nether of these headphones blew the other away in anything but price. So this one was a no brainer for me. These are both high quality headphones. The differences are much less than I expected and many of them will come down to personal preference. If cost is not a number one concern and you listen more to podcasts than music I can see how you might choose the Bose. I have other Bose products currently and the quality is generally very good but I cannot say that I ever felt that the price point was commensurate with the value of the product. Considering the quality I am finding in the Venue's and at 1/2 the price of the Bose, for me it's an easy decision. I am picking the Venue's. Your mileage my vary.
Excellent sound and noise cancellation. The disappointment is with the lack of durability in the ear pads and headband fabric. I don't use them daily and this breakdown is inexcusable, having purchased them Jan 2021.
I'm starting off with mostly comparing these with my Sony xm3's, as these are mainly just a secondary pair for back ups.Personally from the reviews that I was reading in comparison to my sony's for myself personally I do feel that the base on these is a little overpowering for some song selections, as I've mostly been so far listening to chillhop, rock, alternative rock, hip-hop, I've gotten just about the same sound from songs that have a emphasis on base, however the cost is that the base on these can overpower other portions of the sound as a whole, mainly the vocals in certain beats. Some complains I do agree with are that it does have some murky sounds on the lower end of things, but in general I would say for at least the selection I've listen to so far, these are actually pretty decent headphones.These are also great for watching movies/videos, due to the profile of the sound these actually in my opinion do a great job of being able to capture a show as if your watching it in a movie theatre.I personally think the build quality of these FEELS extremely cheap, with all things considering these were on sale for $100 dollars, the regular price on these is around 170. These feel like they can snap at a moment's notice if your not delicate with the band at all, as most of the band on the top has a cheap plastic feel to it.The cups on these as far as it goes for prolonged use, I personally find them to be alright. I have giant ears all day, so I'm always going to prefer larger ear cups for comfort purposes, and although these are smaller than the Sony's I'm not feeling personally that these make your ears feel cramped at all. I was having these on for several hours today's without feeling to much fatigue from wearing themI think overall with the fact I got these on sale, these feel relatively decent considering the sound profile of what I personally listen to, however I have heard some tracks get extremely muddied by the profile of these headphones, so I don't believe that these are for everyone. I do feel that $100 should be the regular price of these headphones, anything above that I personally feel is a rip off with all things considered.
Honest review. I just got these headphones, and overall sound quality is great. They are comfortable, With good cushioning and they're breaking in nicely.-I'm big on aesthetic. They look good all around, though, the 'crimson' ascents are more of a reddish plum color. Definitely looks better in the photos.-Didn't realize this, but it comes with a 3 month subscription to YouTube Music (though my card was already expired. Sent an email). I also got an email from Amazon saying this purchase is eligible for 3 months of Amazon music. So if you don't mind switching up music providers for 6 months of free music, there's a plus.-The bass is alright, could be a little more prominent for what skullcandy likes to deliver. I used the Crushers for years and it's not a competition.-It seems slightly smaller than any of my other headphones but good adjustability. Earcups are also a little small but my ears still fit cause i got small ears. This does, however, make them pretty light, which is a nice switch from my Logitech gaming headset.-The active noise canceling is alright. Got to crank the music louder to hear nothing besides the music. Though there is a difference when ANC is on/off. Past like, 70% volume they are great ANC.-The carrying case is also really nice and the headphones feel well protected.One small thing to note. I'm sure if you're buying these headphones you've YouTubed reviews. One thing that I saw in many of them was that they don't like that they 'creak.' When I first opened mine and tried opening them up they did give off a loud creak, assuming since they've been sitting in a box for a while, but after that, I haven't heard any more. I even went a little exaggerated in moving around the paur and there wasn't much creaking. What they do in the reviews is ridiculous. No ones going to be doing what they do in those videos...I do like Skullcandy, and I'm glad I got them for $100. I don't think I would pay $180 for these.If you find them on sale, go for it. Otherwise be sure to look around for what suits your needs!
These were my first pair of high quality noise cancelling headphones. And wow they really make a difference. For those with a budget of ~$100 like me (when these are on sale) you cannot beat them. The one problem I ran into is I think the noise cancelling technology is too strong for calls, because even with it switched off people had a hard time hearing me.My pair unfortunately broke (heavy use) before a year was up and I was very upset because I loved them. But skullcandy takes their one year warranty seriously! Even if you get them on Amazon on sale. I was so worried they wouldn‚Äôt accept my return since I didn‚Äôt have all the pieces but they accepted everything and gave me credit for the full price of the headphones (which I didn‚Äôt even pay!) so now I‚Äôm getting newer nicer ones worth double the price! Overall really impressed with skullcandy products and customer service.
They're not Bose or Sony, but they are quality.  I own a top of the line pair of both and they are spectacular.  My wife "lost" my QC35's on a business trip and my daughter confiscated my Sony's which now live in student housing.  I saw a review on less expensive than top of the line, wireless, noise cancelling headphone cans.  These were up there in reviews, so I bought them think if they weren't that great, I could always return them and shell out the $400 for another set of Bose.  I am really surprised by the quality of the product.  Noise cancellation, not the best, but pretty darn good.  I can still hear some ambient noise, but not enough to be a distraction, even in quiet parts of movies.  The Sound quality follows along with the noise cancellation, not the best, but really good for the price.  What really satisfies me with this purchase is the battery life.  For ~$90, I get more time than my "lost" Bose or Sony WH-1000XM4.  This comes with a Tile location capability which is pretty handy.  My wife really appreciates that tool.  If I'd had that with the Bose, they wouldn't be lost.  The bottom line, regardless of the money savings, the Skullcandy Venue do a really good job at everything I've asked of them.I can't give them a 5, but I'd give them a solid 4.5 if I could.

I got these so that my small ears would be completely engulfed in the headphones, and they are, but my thin wired frame glasses don't sit normally on my face when I wear the headphones. The foam cups don't adjust like you'd think foam would, but instead push the arms of my glasses into my head, making the bridge of my glasses float on my face instead of resting on my nose.It uncomfortable & not grate for seeing. The sound is fine, but I'm not really picky about it, just wanted basic headphones & these seem pretty basic. The thin flexible plastic "skin" on the ear cups is really very very thin & I imagine that it will not last long but will see. I have a small head for an adult & these fit well without uncomfortable pressure (unless I wear my glasses!) I Am satisfied overall, just wish they worked better with my glasses.Update : I replaced the ear covers with thick angled velour covers  & they are much cooler than the plethor & work better with glasses, still not perfect, but better. these headphones are lighter than most over the ear headphones that I've tried, though others have better sound, these are what i use all the time because of the comfort. After 2 years of everyday use use they are holding up fine
I am accustomed to audiophile level sound,  and these headphones do not deliver in that haughty realm of pipe smoking, 'golden eared,' pretense. However, as everyday headphones they serve admirably. The sound seems a bit compressed and lacking at both ends of the audible spectrum, but I have found no headphones in this price range to offer the full range and dynamics of ostensibly better models.There are lots of headphones in this price range that I have found to be really harsh with glaring faults in some or all part of what us humans can hear. These headphones do not suffer from this sin.The quality seems pretty good save for the cord, which my young cat(he'd kill me if I called him a kitten) found delightfully chewable. Voodoo(the cat) chewed through the casing in a week. The headphones failed due to cord issue not much later, so I soldered up the break in the wire.  That's the reason for the one star knock-off. I have other headphones here and their cords are undeniably more robust.If you have critters that chew, there may be better options in this price range. If not, then I have no reservations about recommending this set.
These are the best budget headphones I've ever used.  Better than expected sound quality and bass and they don't get uncomfortable when worn for extended periods. I bought these cause I wanted something cheap but kinda decent after losing my Sony headphones. These aren't my sonys, but for $10 I'd definitely recommend these if you're on a budget.
For the price these are much better than I expected. Yes, they are made of relatively inexpensive materials, however I get really good sound from them. I only just started using them so I am unable to speak to their durability. They do fit my ears comfortably even after semi-prolonged usage. The longest I've worn them was about three plus hours. Other earphones I've had actually hurt, these my only substantive complaint is I got sweaty behind my ears, but that is not unexpected.
After 2.5 years, I decided to write a review for these headphones. I have a much better pair of closed-back headphones that sound much better. Compared to my more expensive Tascam headphones these sound just average. Thing is, these headphones weigh next to nothing and they are comfortable. I've been using them for more than 2 years, so the quality is good enough. I wear them off and on all day long.The weight and the comfort are the reason I wear them. I think of them as being a good value.
If you have an equalizer in windows, you can certainly tweak this.. But standalone, they sound slightly muffled like it's completely missing tweeter* Update: After 4 months still working good, though one cushion has slipped off.  I was able to slide it back on, but this is annoying.  I really wish a headphone manufacturer would design a more reliable way of attaching cushions more securely than a tiny clip that breaks off, or an elastic band that tucks into a crevice.  Still pretty happy with my purchase, but I think I would gladly pay double for a headphones I knew were built right.
Decent low quality, not built to last. Yet pretty decent for a spare set or a ‚Äústarter set‚Äù.
I‚Äôve brought these headphones three times. I record music, edit music and love listening to music. I‚Äôve used many headphones throughout my years. These are great for the price but DON‚ÄôT LAST . If you take good care of them and are very careful, they might last a year. They are NOT DURABLE or built to last. After a few months with moderate use, you have to hold the cord and jack a certain way for them to work. Very frustrating.positives: Good sound quality for the price. Very comfortable.Negatives: You will not have working headphones for long. It begins with having to hold the cord a certain way and ends with only working on one ear.
Best budget headphones. The amazon product detail does not show the entire spec. It has only 35mm driver but sound pretty decent. The earpads are comfortable for short usage.
These things are great. I use them every week for our livestream at church so that I can listen to the mix in the stream and make sure that we don‚Äôt have too much vocals or piano or anything like that. They usually stay comfortable right up to the end. The cord is a great length and the quality is awesome. I‚Äôm sure that you could find better ones that cost more but I love these and the price was great.If you use headphones all day everyday you may want to look for a different pair but I think these are great.

An upgrade to the ones I previously purchased in terms of sound quality. Not as comfortable though. I think Audio-Technica is a good brand. However, like all audio equipment, if you can go higher end, definitely do so. I had to upgrade the earpads as they were incredibly uncomfortable for me. I wear glasses that these headphones really push the temples into my skull behind my ears. Gives me quite the headache in a short amount of time. The upgraded earpads help, but don't completely resolve this issue for me. An acceptable set of corded heaphones.
These monitor headphones are great for voice reproduction, gaming, and most music. The lows seemed a bit lackluster, but I think that is because I'm used to lower quality headphones that raise the bass to compensate. Built fairly sturdy, especially for my big head, they fit comfortably and stay put.  The plastic feel of the pads makes my ears sweat, that may be an issue in summer months but is not bad right now. The noise cancelling ability is pretty good with the design. Long cord with 1/4" adapter that can be removed and used as 3.5mm input. Can fold up for easy storage or left extended to show off.
The Audio Technica ATH-M30x are excellent sounding headphones in the sub $100 range. I'm using the M30x as a second pair of headphones to listen to music and when watching movies or TV shows on an iPhone, iPad, or through an AV receiver. I wanted headphones that would sound great, be well built, be portable, and yet be affordably priced. In those regards, the M30x delivers.The M30x is a nicely designed successor to the popular M30 headphones which they are replacing. I really like Audio Technica's styling update for the M30x, giving it a look similar to the iconic M50 and newer M50x headphones. Like the M50 and M50x, the M30x now features a collapsible design for space saving portability. Both of those are welcome changes from the dated looking and clunkier M30. A few months back I purchased a pair of M30 headphones, used them for a couple of weeks before returning them, and then purchased the M50 headphones. The design and feel of the M30x is much improved from the M30.-----SPEC COMPARISON BETWEEN ATH-M30x & ATH-M50x:The M50 and M30 were the most popular headphones in Audio Technica's Professional Studio Monitor Headphone lineup so my guess is that the M50x and M30x will be also so I've written a spec comparison between models.1. The M30x has a 40mm driver compared to a 45mm driver in the M50x.2. The M30x has a frequency response of 15-22,000Hz compared to 15-28,000Hz with the M50x.3. The M30x has a maximum input power of 1300mW at 1kHz compared to 1600mW at 1kHz with the M50x.4. The M30x has a sensitivity of 96dB compared to 99dB with the M50x.5. The M30x has an impedance of 47 ohms compared to 38 ohms with the M50x.6. The M30x weighs 7.8oz compared to 10oz with the M50x.7. The M30x has a built in cable compared to detachable cables with the M50x. The straight cables are both 9.8'.With a higher sensitivity, lower impedance, and higher maximum input power  the M50x are a little easier to drive, are a little louder, and can handle more power before clipping than the M30x.-----COMPARING AUDIO TECHNICA's PROFESSIONAL STUDIO MONITOR HEADPHONE LINEUP:If looking at other models in Audio Technica's lineup, the M20x, M30x, and M40x all have 40mm drivers whereas the M50x has 45mm drivers. All have a frequency response on the low end of 15Hz but as the headphone models get better so do the higher end of the frequency response, 20,000Hz with the M20x up to 28,000Hz with the M50x. The M40x and M50x feature detachable cables whereas the cable in the M20x and M30x is built in to the headphones. The M20x isn't collapsible while all the other models are. When examining sensitivity, impedance, and maximum input power, as the models get better the headphones tend to increase in dB's, become easier to drive with a lower impedance, and are able to handle more power before clipping.-----SOUND QUALITY OF M30x & COMPARISON TO M50:The M30x offers excellent sound quality for its price. The headphones produce a rich, clean, and detailed sound with a good amount of bass. I'm really impressed with the sound they are able to produce.Having the M50, I was able to do a comparison between the two headphones. Since many reviewers who own both the M50 and M50x headphones state that the two models sound identical, my sound comparison between the M50 and M30x should provide a good comparison in sound between the M30x and newer M50x headphones.The M50 headphones are a little louder. They produce better bass as a result of the 45mm drivers compared the 40mm drivers in the M30x. The sound from the M50's is also fuller and has better separation. You do get what you pay for but when considering sound to price the M30x offers great bang for your buck.-----PROS:1. Produce a rich, clean, and detailed sound with good bass.2. Affordably priced, great bang for your buck.3. Comfortable to wear.4. Attractive design and lightweight.5. Collapsible for space saving portability. When collapsed they are noticeably smaller than my M50's collapsed.6. Comes with protective carrying pouch and 1/4" adapter for headphone plug. The 3.5mm plug allows the M30x to plug into smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers. The 1/4" adapter allows the headphones to plug into receivers, mixers, and other audio equipment.CONS:1. The "L" & "R" indicators for the cans are inside the headband area and are hard to see in dim lit areas. I much prefer their placement on the can swivel mechanism with the M50/M50x. I know its minor especially if you just remember that the cable comes out of the left side but I thought I'd mention it.-----SUMMARY:The ATH-M30x headphones continue Audio Technica's legacy of producing amazing headphones. At the price point of the M30x, they are very hard to beat. If you are looking for a pair of headphones that sound great, are well built, are portable, and yet are affordably priced as I was, I highly recommend the M30x. If considering other Audio Technica models I recommend spending a little extra money and purchasing the M30x over the M20x. The collapsible design is very nice and the M30x allows almost double the maximum input power than the M20x. If sound quality is your concern over price, the M50x is superior with better bass, separation, and a fuller sound. The build quality is also nicer with the M50x. My M50's feel sturdier, the headband extender feels more durable, and I like the swivel feature of the M50 cans. That's not to take away from the M30x because they are well built headphones for the price.
I have a degree in Recording Arts, and prefer using headphones over speakers for monitors.I am comparing these to the Sony MDR7506, which is generally considered the hands-down best cans under $100. Source sound is Tool.These are definitely on par with the Sonys.The bass is slightly better: More bass, but artificially so. Slightly too much bass, but not overwhelming. A little better than the Sonys, but cancelled out slightly by overdoing it a little.The soundstage, separation, openness, however you want to call it, is definitely lacking as compared to the Sonys. FAR tighter, more like listening in an acoustically well-designed closet, whereas the Sonys sound incredibly natural, almost hyper-natural. This works out as a small advantage in some instances, but overall a net negative.Physical comfort is awesome. Like wearing a pair of your favorite slippers on your ears. No long-term fatigue. The cord is a little annoying in its length, but I'm mostly happy with it (better too long than too short).Sound cancellation is a fraction of a hair better than the Sonys, which is to say incredible. I can block out all but the loudest sounds, with virtually no impact on what I'm listening to. It's really nice that both of them allow flipping the ear cup 180* without the need to take the whole set off or shift them on my ears so that I can hear The Boss or The Spawn try to converse with me.All other aspects seem comparable between the two. Same airy highs. Same overall excellent sound. Same incredible comfort.If you're looking for a tight, modestly bass-accented, noise-cancelling pair of cans for a great price, you'll be incredibly happy with these. Insane bang-for-the-buck value: like a $120 pair of cans. But for $5 more, you can get a $250 pair of cans with the Sonys (just don't expect the bass bump).
These are great for someone like me who has a large head.  How large?  I wear the largest sized hat normally made and that hat is a snug fit!  The added bonus for me is the sound cancellation feature that works because the headphones fit so well.
Happy happy
I very much appreciate the quality of the sound that I‚Äôm able to create with the headphones. The volume control is excellent. When ever I use my headphones all I hear is the music that I‚Äôm trying to process which I totally appreciate.
Was expecting these to be semi-decent, but am really blown away. The only complaints I have are that the mechanism by which the ear cups collapse is a little difficult and to collapse the ear cups is not a very smooth process. I could definitely see this being the first thing to break down after regular use. Another thing is that the cord is just too dang long. I don‚Äôt know what the deal is with headphone cord lengths. Cords seem to be either so short you can‚Äôt even move away from where they‚Äôre plugged in (Apple) or they make them exceptionally long to where you‚Äôre constantly having to move it out of the way, getting tangled up in it, etc. Why can‚Äôt they find a happy medium?!I really have no other complaints though. Time will tell, but so far so good. I am definitely happy with my purchase.
These are great quality, bass is firm and present. Audio is great for EDM genera. Noise cancelation is only passive from headphones covering ears but ambient noise is much quieter. If this is your price point, these headphones are the best you can get.
Easy transaction, as described, quality product and would do business with in the future!
https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-508678-RS135-9-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B08BGD3WYK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews
I purchased this product because my central a/c unit was loud and my hearing has deteriorated to the extent that I couldn‚Äôt understand what was being said on tv without closed captioning being on all the time. So far it has worked flawlessly, the sound quality is excellent, the range is so good I can walk outside to my car without signal and I‚Äôve sat, on weekends, for more than 8 hours (more than a normal person ever shouldüòÇ) watching news, movies and listening to music and still have never run the batteries down!
It would work for my hubby who keeps the volume excessively high, using the ear phone jack.I wanted one that would play volume for the rest of us in open air at the same time.  Sadly this new TV has no stereo/RCA cable input so, I had to return.
Sennhieser RS135 has a good sound for what I use them for. The problem I have is it like having two pieces of wood against head, not very comfortable. The price was so good I was going upgrade to padded earmuffs. But they do not have any upgraded earmuffs. It a great product just not comfortable.
Purchased these so I could watch TV and play PS later at night and not wake up everyone in the house. I connected these to my stereo receiver, which in turn is connected to the TV, game systems, fire stick etc....These advertise being able to connect to an optical out, audio out or 5.6mm headphone jack.  For my setup, only the headphone jack would work as that would allow all the different sound sources which are plugged into the receiver, to go to the headphones.Sadly, this connection method leaves a lot to  be desired.  Even with the ability to "tune" the headphones there was still noticeable static which would get worse or better depending on how I turned my head.  There would also be random pops of static which were much louder than the audio I was listening to which was very annoying.I returned the 1st pair and tried a replacement pair in the hope's it was just a bad set, but the 2nd pair had the same exact issues.In the end, I ended up returning these and purchasing the RS 175 headphones.  Those are much better in terms of sound quality and although more expensive, I feel they do a good job and are worth it.
Like you would expect these Sennheiser headphones produce a pleasing sound.  Easy to wear with good flat on the ear layout. A brilliant physical design, the batteries (AAA nickel metal, hydride are perfect for these long lived rechargeable cans)  Audiophiles won't like these, just based on price.  All 1% er's spend all you want ~ you can spend as much as you want on headphones ~ with diminishing returns.  I usually wear them for 4 hours listening to an eclectic mix on Spotify with comfort.  I love that these phones have 3 analog adjustments on the earpieces themselves.  Bass headed rappers will not like these, as these are not tone colored at all. Buy the RS-135-9 model.  The chrome bar that holds the phones on the base acts as the wireless antenna and supplies the batteries with a nice trickle charge while they are not in use.  Not blutooth, analog... remember?  One warning is that these headphones rest gently on your head, so if you're up and dancing you will dance the phones off your head.  So just don't...
orderd over the ear - recieved on ear - they slide off my with very little movement - echo feedback from tv .
It‚Äôs an absolute wonderful product! Now my husband can watch television without it blaring!
I bought them for my 94 year old father to help him hear his tv without running everyone out of the house. 1st pair lasted 10 years of constant abuse ie being dropped and sleeping with them on.
i'm over 60 and i can't hear worth a lick when the tv is at regular volume. this has an individual volume control, so i can turn it up for me without disturbing everyone else watching.
Sound Quality very good, A bit uncomfortable when you wear glasses but I can adjust my glasses to make it better. I can walk all over my house and have crisp clear sound. I have not tried it outdoors to see how far I can go and still be clear although I probably would not use them outdoors as the earpads are not coated to make them sweat resistant.  I would recommend these earphones

First let me tell you I am an audiophile to max, I am very picky about sound quality. That being said I wanted a pair of headphones that would deliver when I am at the gym so I didn't rish ruining my other high end headphones that are not made for that purpose. These Underarour Sports Headphones, endorsed by Dwayne Johnson, impressed me more than I thought they would. They are durable, offer great ventilation for over the ear headphones, and most importantly sound AMAZING! The controls are easy to use for volume control, skipping to next track, answering call and so forth. My gym has a lot of backgroud noise but the noise cancelling in these headphones takes care of that and puts me in my own audio bubble while I am working out. Can't recommend them enough.
These are without a doubt the best headphones I‚Äôve ever had! The bass with some songs and JBL headphones app eq is insane! I‚Äôll buy the white ones next just to mix up my style these are my new favorite purchase I‚Äôve ever made!
When I run with these, there is a continuous ticking/clicking sound coming from either speaker at anytime. The sound quality is not what I expected. Switching from mid-priced/range earphones to these expensive headphones, I expected much more.They are also top heavy. When doing slow and controlled sit-ups, these headphones flop back and forth.They fall off. Not sure if it's due to the top heaviness or the loose swivel portion of the phones but when I bench-press or lay down, they slip off my ears.The auto-stop feature works when it wants to.Excessive wind noise when running.Random speaker noise that sounds somewhere between white noise and a dial up internet connection that only goes away when your cycle the power.When doing full extension chin ups/pull ups, my shoulders smack the oversized headphones.When setting up or moving my head ever so slightly on the standing calf raise machine, the headphones bang on the should rest due to their large size.Overall, they fit very loose.The only think I like is the long battery life.These certainly aren't worth the original retail price of $300 nor the half-off price.

I'll start by stating that I am replacing an older pair of active noise canceling headphones that I used for 5-6 hours/day for the past four years in varying office environments.  The old pair had a plastic swivel attaching the ear cup to the head band which finally broke after about a thousand times (literally, do the math) placing them into and taking them out of the case.As I mentioned I use these headphones primarily in an office environment to listen to music (I'm a software developer) and/or to just block out the constant hum of HVAC systems, etc.  I've been reading countless of reviews on numerous headphones looking for something that fits my needs and after much consideration I settled on the QC25's.The main things I took into consideration when looking for my replacement headphones were:  comfort, sound quality, noise cancelation, noise leakage, craftsmanship/durability, battery life, case, style, features (wireless/playback control/etc), and price.  Here's how the QC25 rates:Comfort - 5/5 - These are the most comfortable non-studio headphones I have ever worn.  They are fairly light weight and have a large over-ear design.  The ear cups are also fairly deep so there's no contact between my ears and the ear pieces at all.  The cups rotate to allow you to wear these comfortably on your head however you desire.  The material on the ear cups is a soft foam filled leather that doesn't apply too much pressure to the side of the head (I wear glasses so ear comfort is of utmost importance to me).  There is also a foam filled suede material on the top of the headband making the headphones rest comfortably on your head.Sound Quality - 5/5 - Excellent and well balanced.  If you're looking for headphones that just amplify the lows and the highs, these are not for you.  If you want solid lows, crisp highs and a pronounced mid-range then look no further.  These headphones play the music as-is and let you control any equalization you feel is necessary for your best listening experience.  I suppose if you're just into thumping base and are listening from a mobile device that doesn't support custom equalization you may be better off with a different brand.Noise Cancelation - 5/5 - The first thing I did when I got these is pop in the included battery and walk into my furnace room (the furnace was running) to see the impact and it was profound.  These far outperformed my previous noise canceling headphones (which weren't too shabby).  At work I sit near a call center where there are typically 4-6 people on the phone during busier times.  There are also heat pump units in the ceiling which hum and buzz throughout the day (especially since the temperatures have been in the single digits the past several weeks).  The second I flip the switch on all of the humming and buzzing is gone without a trace.  The call center noise is also greatly reduced (I'd say about 70% quieter than without the headphones on) to the point that I have a hard time focusing on any one conversation.  This is of course remedied when I turn on some music and the awesome sound quality completely drowns out any remaining distractions.  I frequently have colleagues walk up and do jumping jacks to get my attention as I don't even hear them knocking on my desk when I'm "in the zone".Noise Leakage - 4/5 - One of my slight disappointments with the QC25 is the level of noise leakage (the amount of sound that can be heard by people nearby).  At a comfortable listening level the noise leakage can be heard from 4-5 feet away.  If you like to listen to your music loud, expect people up to 10 feet away (in quiet environments) to sing along with your tunes.  I'm currently in a cubicle environment so the closest person to me is about 5 feet away, however at my previous office I sat 3 feet from another guy with no divider so it definitely would have been an issue there (except he wore headphones all day as well ;).Craftsmanship/Durability - 5/5 - I only have a couple pairs of headphones to compare these to but they look like they are made well.  The joints and swivels are made with metal parts and are fastened with screws.  The headband is made from a metal ribbon surrounded by plastic.  The cup internals are covered with a rugged cloth (as opposed to the foam covering which often disintegrates after extended use).  The ear cups are a foam filled leather material that seems durable (same style on my old headphones and those lasted 4+ years).  Even the cord is made with sturdy gold-plated ends.  They flex well and seem like they would last a long time even on larger heads. (I had a friend who ate through headphones due to his large head).Battery Life - 4/5 - So far the battery life on these is acceptable.  The noise canceling feature is typically on for 6-8 hours a day and I find that so far I've gone 2-3 days before swapping batteries.  I am also using some older rechargeable batteries which probably don't have the same life that they once did.  I have not completely drained a standard AAA battery to see how much life you get out of those.  The battery life is comparable to my old headphones (which is where the batteries came from) and is sufficient for my needs.Case - 4/5 - The carrying case included with the headphones is sturdy and has a nice look/feel to it.  The headphones fold up rather small and fit neatly into the case leaving just enough room for the included headphone cable and maybe an adapter or two.  There is an elastic pouch on the back side of the case but it is designed more for storing your instruction manual or thin items (perhaps an extra cable?).  Because of my obsessive use of the headphones I own a small USB powered AAA batter charger which fit perfectly into my old case...when my batteries were low I could pull out the charger and charge a battery while my backup was in the headphones...not so with this new case.  Fortunately I almost always use the headphones with my macbook pro so I can keep the battery charger in my laptop bag when I need it.  Aside from that, the case is very compact and does include a little slot for a spare battery (one AAA is included) as well as an airplane adapter.Style - 5/5 - I own the black design and I like them.  I'm not a style buff when it comes to headphones but I certainly don't want some big ugly things on my head.  These are sleek with an undertone of teal on the cups and on the in-line playback controller.  The plastic is a brushed style and I am overall very pleased with how these look.Features - 4/5 - The only feature I was passively looking for in headphones that these don't have is wireless capabilities.  This isn't a show stopper for me, of course, since I came from wired headphones and I am typically always at my desk when using them.  Again, I do not use these while walking about listening to music from my phone or music player so I can't speak to that experience.  There are inline playback controls which consists of a small (1.25" long) control with three buttons.  There is a volume up button, a volume down button and a center button to control playback.  A single press of the center button will play/pause your music, a double-tap of the button will skip to the next track and a triple-tap will skip to the previous track.  I already have keyboard controls for this functionality but I imagine if listening to a music device (that supports inline playback controls) this would be convenient.Price - 4/5 - Who doesn't want more for less?  For the quality and package you get the price is fair.  If you're looking for an exceptional pair of headphones with great noise canceling, great sound and decent features this is a great option to consider.Overall - 4.5/5 - I would recommend these to anyone that doesn't mind being wired to their audio source and who doesn't mind anyone within their reach being able to hear what they're listening to.  I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase and would buy them again.
As a frequent flier, I depend heavily on noise cancelling headphones to get me through long flights, and I purchased these Bose headphones to replace an older Sennheiser in-ear set.  I knew what I was getting, more or less, because I had purchased a pair of QC15s for my husband a few years ago, and I had used those.  With my own headphones on a couple of transatlantic flights, however, I fell in love with these.  The active noise cancellation cuts out what seems like 95% of engine whine -- the sound inside the airplane seems deafening when I take them off.  That said, there's a decided difference between choosing an over-ear set and an in-ear one -- and, as much as I love these, I'm not sure I made the right choice.  Scroll down for more on that topic.If you've never used active noise cancelling headphones, then it helps to understand what you're getting.  Active noise cancelling technology uses an electronic hiss, powered by a battery, to cancel out a specific noise frequency, one that is created by engine whine or other mechanical sounds.  These are not soundproof headphones or ear protection.  You can hear the voices around you, albeit muffled.  For instance, when the pilot comes on over the PA system, I can hear it and might even be able to hear exactly what's being said, even if I'm listening to music or a movie.  (I don't use a high volume, though.)  The kicker, though, is how much engine whine is filtered out.  Most people aren't aware of just how loud the inside of a plane cabin is -- and you won't, probably, unless you use noise-cancelling headphones.  Bose is unparalleled in noise cancellation technology -- my Sennheisers were good, but not this effective -- and, as a result, I turned these on without sound for a couple of hours just to protect my ears.Although the audio quality is very good, I prefer other headphones while on the ground, mostly because these aren't as precise as some others that I own.  They do reproduce a full range, from bass to treble, though, so if you can only afford one set and need noise cancellation features as well as excellent sound, then don't hesitate with the Bose.  You won't find another headphone with this quality of noise cancellation, period, so you'll end up disappointed by compromising.  Flicking the noise cancellation on improves the sound, even without engine whine, by giving it more depth, although, again, the sound is fine even in regular mode.  Still, at the price, I wouldn't recommend these unless you need the noise cancellation.The build quality is good, with comfortable padding around the ears.  The ear cups float on articulated joints to adjust to a variety of head shapes.  That said, these headphones pose certain problems for women in particular.  I cannot wear earrings, even studs, without some discomfort, and the articulated part over the ear cups sometimes catches my hair and pulls out a few strands.  Those of us with smaller heads don't get the same contact of the headphones against the head.  My husband tried on mine, and the cups made full contact around his ears while I had a slight, almost impercepible gap.  The headpiece is adjustable for larger heads. I have to use mine on the smallest setting. The inside of the ear cups is blue with huge R and L on the fabric.  It looks tacky but it's extremely useful, and I see it only when I first take them out of the case.For those who are contemplating whether to get over-the-head or in-ear headphones:  in-ear models tend to block out more ambient sound.  They plug your ears in ways an over-ear one will not.  Bose makes an in-ear noise cancelling set (QC20) that I was considering before I bought these, and I now wonder if they would have been better for me since in-ear doesn't bug me the way that it does other people.  My Ultimate Ears in-ear set blocks out sound better, although not engine noise.  I went for the known quantity, however, since I had tried my husband's.  As I said earlier, I'm not sure I made the right choice even though I'm extremely happy with the performance of the QC25.The case for the QuietComfort 25 is more compact that the one for the QC15, and so takes up less room in my bag, something I was initially worried about since space is always at a premium.  It comes with one AAA battery, an airplane adapter, and the detachable cable with in-line mic and music controls.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
I balked at buying the Bose, because I thought it was overpriced, and that probably all the manufacturers used the same generic digital signal processing chip. I've had two other inexpensive NC headsets, and thought they worked alright.  The first non-Bose headset, I had two of, because the cables kept fraying and breaking.  Can't remember the brand name anymore, but they were only about $35, so I thought, well, just my bad luck.  Replaced them with inexpensive ($50) Sony headsets, and the Sony cables are durable, but the sound quality and cancellation wasn't quite as good, to my ears.  Nevertheless, I kept the Sonys (and still have them), thinking again that Bose was just too darned expensive.  Then I saw one day in the classroom that I work in, that there were several Bose QC25 headsets that the school had purchased, so I thought, hey, here's a chance to see if they're really worth all that money.  The teacher let me borrow a pair, and as I left the school, I parked on the street, with my windows down, to listen to the car traffic go by, and try these out in an A/B test with the Sony NC headsets.  Wow!  It took me all of about 30 seconds to decide that they were worth the money.  One of the reasons, perhaps, that they work so well, is that the headset completely covers my ear, and the Sony headsets did not have complete ear coverage.  I've worn them for long periods of time, without discomfort, although if I wear them on the treadmill in the gym, they need to be wiped off from the perspiration on my head.  My first A/B test with the Bose QC25 was to put it on, without plugging it into any device, and just switch the NC on and off, as cars and  trucks passed by on the street.  The results were simple:  switched off, there was car noise; switched on, there was silence.  I ordered a pair immediately, and have been happy with them ever since.  They are great at cancelling droning noises, such as cars, or airplane engines, but not so good at nearby conversations.  I do use them when working in a library, and they do a fair job of cancelling out the noisy kids at the next table, but not as profound as engine noise reduction.  The big advantage I see to this model is that they use a single AAA battery, which lasts me about a week of listening to audiobooks, and the case has a holder for a spare battery.  A rechargeable AAA battery works just fine, and the later model Bose headsets use some sort of proprietary non-replaceable battery, which in my view is a deal breaker.  Your views about the bluetooth feature may make you think that the later Bose model would be better, but in my mind it's not, due to the many documented problems with bluetooth.  These wired headsets just simply work, with anything that has a standard audio jack.  The cable is not an inconvenience for me, and the easily replaceable AAA battery is a big plus.  As for the cable, when I unpacked the box and saw it, my first thought was that if these expensive cables fray and break, I'm going to be out a bunch of money to replace them.  Not true, you can buy generic replacement cables on Amazon, I did buy a couple, tried them, out, and tossed them into the drawer as backups, after finding that they worked just fine.  I got two generic cables for less than the price of one Bose cable.  My only advice as to these cables is this: they come in two flavors; one works only with Android and generic devices, and the other flavor works with Apple.  Make sure you order the correct one for your device.  I have used the Bose QC25 in place of my Plantronics bluetooth on my phone (android), and they work just fine, although legally I can't use them if I am driving, and must use my little hands-free earbud instead.  They also work fine on my laptop, and a little generic MP3 player.  The sound level is about the same in these headsets, with the power on or off, but they do sound a lot better with the power on.  In short, spend the money, they're worth it.
Although these headphones are pricey, they are well worth it. They are a marked improvement in sound quality and design from the QC 15's. Prior to the QC 25's, my primary headphones were the Bose AE2 headphones, which I absolutely loved. They sounded great and they were very comfortable, however, when in a loud environment the sound quality diminished greatly. With the QC 25's. this simply is not so. The 25's provide excellent sound quality no matter how loud it is around you.Design:The design of these headphones is absolutely superb. They plastics feel very sturdy, and they have yet to be scratched. I never worry about these headphone getting damaged simply because of how solid they feel. The headphone cups rotate to lay flat when around your neck, but they only rotate about half that in the other direction. This has never been a problem in any way for me. One thing that I really like about these headphones is that when I use them just for the noise cancelling, there isn't a massive gap on the side of my headphones where the cable plugs in. It does not effect anything except for the aesthetics. The outside of the headphone (with the Bose label) is made of some sort of metal, presumably aluminum. This also adds to the overall aura of quality that surrounds these headphones. Another thing that I really like about these headphones is that the headband no longer has leather wrapped on the top. While it looks and feels great at first, after a few years this leather starts to break down and flake off. Again, it's not the end of the world, but it doesn't look the greatest when it happens. The cloth on headband of the 25's feels very high quality and seems like it would be very easy and simple to clean, if need be. Although these headphones are slightly heavier than my old AE2's, even after 6+ hours I can barely tell that they are there. As is with all Bose around-ear headphones, there cups feel heavenly, and are easily replaceable. These headphones definitely feel like they are designed to last.Sound Quality:As I mentioned earlier, these headphone are a marked improvement in terms of sound quality over its predecessor. They don't feel "closed off ", as the 15's do, and they are definitely louder. When the noise cancelling is off the sound  quality definitely drops, but it is still better than a lot of headphones on the market. The biggest difference between having the noise cancelling off and on was the volume of the music. I would definitely recommend listening to music with the noise cancelling on, otherwise, what's the point? Overall these headphones sounds great. I am not saying that they are the best sounding $300 on headphones are the market, but they are way up there. An important note is that while there are better sounding headphones out there, none of them can boast the level of noise cancelling that the 25's do, and that is a huge deal when yours on a bus or plane, or somewhere generally loud.Noise Cancelling:When compared to the 15's you would be hard pressed to notice a difference with the noise cancelling. Not to say that the noise cancelling needed improvement, but if you're buying these headphone just for the noise cancelling you might want to consider the 15's if the $300 price tag seems just a tad too high. That being said, I love the noise cancelling on these headphones. They block out all of the low frequencies, and drastically reduce the volume of higher frequencies. The result is that you will most likely be able to have a normal conversation with someone while wearing these (no music of course). I use these headphones at work when I am down in the shop, and I never cease to be impressed by these headphones. When I traveled to London a couple years ago my girlfriend and I could have a normal conversation while wearing these (she has the 15's), when no one else could hear us. I also wear these headphones a lot in the car (not when I'm driving, of course), and they make a long car ride a heck of a lot more bearable. Also, as I mentioned earlier, the greatest thing about the 25's is that your music always sounds great, no matter how loud it is around you. When is comes to noise cancelling, Bose is the best.Battery and Case:As for the battery, I seem to get right around 35 hours on a AAA. The case also has a very convenient spot for a spare battery. The case is the perfect size, and it fits almost anywhere just perfectly. It is much better than the QC 15 case. It is a semi-hard case, which is good for finding a place to put it, and since the headphones are so durable themselves, the case definitely does not need to be hard.Overall these headphones are great. The design, sound quality, battery life, cable and case are all superb. I would definitely recommend these headphones for anyone who loves music, and ever has to be in a noisy environment (i.e. everyone). This is definitely one of the best purchases, and I look forward to using these headphones for years to come.
Allow me to start by saying I'm not a headphone connoisseur. I'm not necessarily an audiophile, but I do love music and I have synaesthesia for what that's worth. I can't really be biased towards or against them as such...I've never owned anything Bose related, and my only experiences with Bose have been limited to store tests and my grandfather's sound system. I have upgraded to these headphones from a pair of Behringer HMP100s BEHRINGER HPM1000 that have served their purpose well. (Yes, it's a significant jump) I have worked with pretty nice headphones before, some mid-end Sennheisers and the like, but never Bose.I work with video and audio mixing/editing, as well as manage a podcast, so all I really look for is clarity and comfort. Needless to say these are very comfortable. They're soft while tight enough for them to feel like they're not going to fly off, so that's a plus for me. (I do tend to go out for runs, and the haven't so much as shifted on my head.)So, as far as sound quality goes, without the switch on, they sound as good (If not better) than the Behringers, while sounding massively better with the cancellation and amp on. I'm noticing little nuances in music I have never heard in music I've not noticed (or been able to hear) with my other headphones. Though if you have the amp on, there are occasional times where I can hear a slight ticking with bass, but it's not consistent with every kind of bass I've heard, it's rather hard to describe. A lower-quality song with a more direct bass will case a slight rattle, but a higher-quality version of the same song won't have the same rattling. Also there is a small amount of sound-bleeding at mildly high volumes, but it isn't loud enough to hear outside of arm's reach. I'd say at 3/4 volume, the radius of being able to hear sound leaking would be around 6', give or take.The cancellation: Alright, I always like things that have noise isolation. Isolation is nice, but I've only owned one set of active noise cancelling headphones and they were 'meh' at best. They wouldn't quite filter out road noise, while these will block out things like a generator running, construction noise, dogs barking (Provided they aren't right in your ear), and so on. I'd definitely recommend them on that basis alone. There are a couple of little quirks I've noticed with the cancellation, nothing dealbreaking or anything... like for example, if you're sitting in a car, and someone opens and then closes the door, the resulting 'whoosh' does seem to confuse the cancellation a bit as whatever I'm listening to will stutter for a second.Comfort: I haven't noticed any sort of fatigue or unwelcome pressure even with glasses on. They are also secure enough not to fly off, even with rapid head movements. They also feel rugged enough to take a drop or two without shattering, and that's always a plus for me.So, all that to say: As a first time Bose owner, I'm satisfied. They deliver on everything advertised, and met my expectations.I'm not sure I'd recommend them to someone that's just looking for a minimal good pair of headphones for the price, as they are to meet a specific criteria. If you can spare the cost, enjoy music, and also enjoy quiet to the extent of considering them, I'd say go for it. If you're just looking for something expensive for bragging rights... well, that's entirely up to you.A couple of things to note: if you have lower quality MP3s, you will definitely notice. And these do NOT play well with any sort of bass boosting. They have a good amount of bass on their own, but if you add in extra bass they may very well start rattling like crazy.Oh, and if you're the kind of person that tends to shout when you wear headphones, I'd approach with caution. With the noise cancellation on, it's pretty hard to hear your own voice. I'm softspoken, and never really talk loud to begin with, but I let some relatives try it on and that resulted in yelling worthy of a sports stadium... Then again, that's not really Bose's fault, and just a bit of a personal note.I hope this helps. (If I missed something, I'll try to answer questions as best I can)
I was a little reluctant to buy these based on some reports that they fail for a portion of owners after short use.  But I decided this failure is probably due to using the carry case which is provided by Bose, which requires quite a bit of twisting of the ear pieces to downsize them for storage, coupled with fairly frail wiring. I opted to buy another carry case that does not require any twisting for storage, thinking this might prevent that issue. I'll let you know if they fail anyway. So far I have been impressed with them in actual use. I've used them on city buses and in the car while traveling as a passenger. The music quality is fine for travel, and the noise reduction is substantial.  On the bus, if I'm listening to music at a low volume, I can't hear bus engine or braking noise, cell phone chatter, or misc noises, but I can still hear the bus stop announcements ( I usually sit near the front of the bus). In the car, even with no music on, engine and road noise completely disappear, nor can I hear my wife cursing at other drivers, unless she's really screaming. She has to signal me with her hands when she wants to talk to me.I haven't had a chance to use them yet on an aircraft, but we are headed to Europe this summer, so will get to test them on the way out and back. I also carry my earbuds with me, which themselves are pretty isolating (though not attenuating); this in case I have the misfortune of sitting near a screaming baby. I'm sure the buds, plus covering the ears with the Bose will cancel even that noise. I really feel for babies on planes, they don't know how to clear their ears, so probably are in terrible pan with the pressure changes, but I definitely do not want to share their pain on a long trip.My only issues with the headphones: 1) The plug going in to the headphones, tends to pull out rather easily part way, this leaves the right ear without any music. I resolved this by taking the shirt clip off an older pair of headphones and putting this on the cord. 2) I find it a little tricky to get the door open on the phones where the battery goes in. Fortunately, the battery seems to last a long time, so you shouldn't have to change it much. Its also a little hard to read the tiny + and - markings to place the battery in the slot in the correct direction. So note which way this goes while you are in bright light, and memorize it in case you have to do it in low light.I've been using the headphones with my Sansa Clip, so far this has had more than adequate power to drive the headphones with no issues at the volumes I listen, which is not usually very loud, without any noticeable distortion. Of course with the Sansa, I don't have control of volume with the switch on the Bose cord, since its not an Android device, but I don't find this to be a problem. Haven't gotten around to trying them on my Nexus 7.I'm actually not a fan of the Bose home systems that I have listened to, they all seem a bit bassy, muddy and unfocused, but one has to notice that one of Bose major production items, aside from home speakers, is headphones for professional pilots. I think its fair to say they know noise attenuation. So far I'm glad I got these, even if they do seem a bit pricey. Will write a follow up review if they don't hold up, in spite of the bigger carrying case.
I bought these headphones in 2019 before traveling internationally to ensure I had high quality headphones for my flights. Now, when a lot of people hear the phrase noise cancelling, I think an unrealistic expectation pops into their head. They imagine being able to put a pair of headphones in and immediately erase all external noise. Maybe there are headphones that can do that, but I think the average pair just dims the external noise and cuts out specific frequencies as best as they can which is what these do. For my 7 hour flights, they dulled the roar of the plane and didn't feel too tight or painful, so I think the name QuietComfort holds up.Since then, I have been using these almost daily though mostly without the noise cancelling feature. The fidelity of the sound isn't perfect which I suspect has to do with part of the design being devoted to noise cancelling, but unless you are a devout audiophile, I would expect these would get the job done for most people. The actual construction of the headphone has generally held up really well with the cord and headphone itself still being original. The headphone speakers themselves haven't blown out and still sound relatively crisp. After about two years of regular use, the ear pieces did require replacement since they were breaking, but I think that is a reasonable lifespan for pieces of foam with faux-leather sewn over them.Design-wise I believe there is one flaw worth mentioning which is if you have longer hair (more than a couple inches on the sides) the swivel of the headphone will sometimes snag on your hair when you try and take them off which is uncomfortable.Overall, if you need noise cancelling headphones that you can wear for extend periods of time, I would recommend these. If you need headphones primarily for listening to music without noise cancelling, I might seek out other options.
I give these headphones five stars, but I will say the battery wears out VERY fast. I was going through way too many batteries, and they are bad for the environment. I invested in a rechargeable battery set-up and the problem is solved. These headphones are a must for noise cancellation, such as on flights, or just in your home.
SUMMARY: I've had these for a year, buying them during a sale for $110 + tax. Overall I'm happy and they make a big difference in during my constant travels (see below), but the cord is way too long and doesn't connect well, has to be placed just so to keep the audio from going mono or out completely.THE GOOD: Regarding noise cancellation and sound quality it's great for my needs, which is mostly to quiet out the drone of airplanes/trains/cars when traveling and allowing me to enjoy in-flight entertainment. Some hums disappear completely whereas others are greatly muted, and sometimes I use them without any music to just cancel noise while I read or try to nap. I can't believe I put up with long flights without these before! You can somewhat hear what people are saying depending on the pitch of their voice, but it's definitely quiet enough to concentrate and comfortable enough to wear for hours. I haven't yet had issues with the ear pads or other material degrading as others have noted. I like the compact case and the adapter for planes with the double-plug audio ports has come in use, as well as the space for an extra battery (though I've just thrown a pack of five in the case so I'm not worried). Music sounds better with noise cancellation on than off, it's pretty poor when off.THE BAD: the cord is too long and in my case doesn't connect properly. First about the connection bit: I have to insert and twist it just so in order to get audio out of both sides, otherwise I get just one side or none at all. And then once I have it right, if I make any sudden movements or even twist my head too quickly it's enough for the audio to go out (even though the cable is plugged all the way in.) I could probably have gotten a replacement from Bose for this but it annoys me to go through that process and I feel that products of a company that claims such a focus on quality should just work well and go through rigorous quality control. Regarding the cord length, I can't fathom why they made it so long, perhaps so you can sit on a couch and plug in to a receiver a few feet away? But in a more typical modern situation of plugging into your phone to listen on the go, you end up having to wrap it around yourself or thread it through your belt loops just to try to keep it under control. It's so long it's sometimes even tough to store it comfortably in the case. I'd buy a shorter cord aftermarket cord to fix this but then wouldn't have the volume controls, so I'm just living with it, oh well. I guess all future models are bluetooth anyway.
I ordered a pair in Black but received a pair in White instead. These headphones are so good, that I decided to keep the White ones. I did not know if I returned them, asking for the color Black if they may just send the White ones again. I highly recommend them.

I am not an Avantree hype-man, but I will do everyone a favor here: The three 1 Star reviews are basically garbage. Let me scroll through some of the main issues that they bring up and then I will address a few problems. 1. Inferior sound quality and random switching between call quality and playback quality. - I have never had that happen once and the quality switching is most likely due to the sound card in their PC. 2. The latency is between 0.5-2.0 seconds. - I have never experienced this, and, again, this could be due to sub par computer innards. 3. They pale in comparison to the Beats Solo 3 headphones. - Okay, I am a music producer and mix with my headphones as well as monitors, and have had/used high-end headphones, and Beats being superior to the Avantree is true. The Avantree are not up to par with the Beats headphones...but they are also roughly $150-$200 cheaper. You do get what you pay for. I would like to say that they do not "pale in comparison," the merely aren't as good. 4. Claims that the range is minimal. - I haven't had any problems with the range as so long as I am not behind two, lead painted walls...and even then they only cut out a bit. (Yes, I have thick walls with lead paint in my house.) 5. The guy complaining about the lack of Windows 7 compatibility (MANY people have complained about this on a lot of online forums,) as well as other OS's. - Okay. I know computers (you'll have to take my word for it.) First: The headset does not have a firmware problem (someone mentioned cutting out due to the firmware, and not connecting;) second: It is not any one specific OS or a Mac or PC thing, though Win7 is the worst offender being sorely behind the times on some much needed upgrades. Now, let me say that I couldn't even detect them at first with my copy of Windows 7 Ultimate and when they were recognized, I paired them easily, but there was no sound or it kept telling me that there was an install issue with the firmware. Why? My drivers needed to be updated. That's all. You don't need Bluesoleil (a wireless control/bridge center,) or any other fancy crap (unless your computer doesn't have wireless capability, in which case, you need a wireless adapter,) all you have to do is what we all hate doing and update your drivers for whatever your running, and you're fine. It'll work...at least with Win7Ult., which is one of the worst with Bluetooth/firmware. (Side Note: If you do not update your drivers, purchasing Bluesoleil WILL bridge the connection gap in between the headphones and the computer, but why spend an extra $30?)So, all that being said and done with...There are some complaints that seem valid; a battery that won't keep charge, static, low sound, or syncing issues. All I can say is that these things happen. I have no doubt that these people have legitimately faulty headphones and are not just too stupid to figure out if it is some failing on their end; every brand churns out some duds. Also mentioned was the multi-pairing just grabbing the first Bluetooth signals it encounters with seemingly no proprietary options. This is true. I don't use it for multiple pairings, so it doesn't affect me, but it is a valid complaint and is a feature that should not have been overlooked. The microphone not being useable due to not picking up your voice well enough hasn't been a problem for me, but it was mentioned, so it might fall under the afore mentioned "You got a dud" category. As for the guy with the busted charging port, I would say that that sounds like a user error, but if not, it is another faulty set. (I actually just took my pair off while writing this review right now and tested the solidarity of the charging port and I have no idea how it could become dislodged into the casing like he did, but maybe he got a faulty press.)So Final Review? - I use these for movies and music, but, as I mentioned, I produce music, and I have a pretty good ear for sound; I have to, and they deliver. The sound quality of the 3.5 audio jack connection and the wireless connection are identical. Some people complain about any audio equipment that they purchase; everyone thinks that he or she is an aficionado, but these are better headphones than the Koss, Sony, and other name brands that I have owned for similar prices. As for comfort, the muffs are built to be firm, but not too firm so they don't become uncomfortable even after hours of use, and the headband sits well. The muffs also cancel out most sound when being worn and people can barely hear what you are listening to even when they are turned up. I have never found a pair of headphones of this quality for a price this low. Are they the last pair of headphones you will ever need to purchase? Nope, but for the price they deliver. Also? One of the 1 Star people gave a shout out to Avantree's Support, and I have to agree. They actually answer their phones and don't act like your an idiot, and the lady whom I emailed got back to me within twenty-four hours and was very helpful. I recommend giving these a try if you are on a budget and can't quite afford the Pioneer Air Studios. Plus, they come with a two-year warranty.I hope all this helps.
Bought these Nov 20, 2017 and they are still going strong, I use them almost daily. Battery life is not quite what it was after 5 years, of course, but they still last a long time on a single charge. If they eventually break I will probably still buy another pair.
I am currently on my 3rd pair and absolutely love these headphones. Don't get me wrong, it is not because that these headphones have a small lifespan that I am on my 3rd pair, it's quite the opposite.Too Long;Didn‚Äôt Read: Outstanding Battery Life, Manufactured to last, Great Bluetooth Range, Exceptional Headset, Phenomenal Customer Service, Great Quality for the Price. Only downside was it was hard to adjust the headband initially, but once you adjust them they stay put, which is a plus if you exercise with them.I bought my first pair February 2016 as I was looking for some Bluetooth headphones to remove the inconvenience of wired earphones/headphones. After doing some research and looking at the reviews, I bought these headphones. The moment I turned them on and connected it to my phone, I fell in love. I wore them daily and listened to music & audio books, with them, any chance I got. After a month, I was on spring break so I went home for a visit. During my visit I lent the headphones to my little sister. She also loved them and wanted them badly, so I gave them to her. She still has her pair and they still work well.After giving her my headphones, I decided to cheat on Avantree, which I regret, and purchase another highly reviewed pair of bluetooth headphones, the August EP650s. These did not last as long as I thought they would. Comparing the August EP650s to the Avantree headphones, the Avantree headphones outperformed the EP650s in ergonomics, battery life, durability, and bluetooth range. I did like the ability to fold the EP650s though. I did purchase insurance for these headphones and was able to get a full refund when they finally gave out. I, however, did not plan on purchasing another pair of EP650s.After the EP650s, I decided to go back to my roots and purchase some Symphonized wood wired earphones. Loved these earphones, the sound was rich, I could wear them for hours, and they looked really nice. The only downside was the wires, it felt like they were always in the way when I was on the move. After some good solid months of putting them in my pocket, tugging and bending the wires, the earphones finally gave out.The Symphonized headphones gave out a few weeks before spring break 2017, so I decided to wait and take my time choosing my next pair of earphones/headphones. However, this year I didn‚Äôt make any plans and was dead from my finals so I just wanted to ‚Äúrelax‚Äù back home- or so I thought. It was when I was back home that my mom asked me if I could repaint my little brother‚Äôs room. I said sure why not, but for those who don‚Äôt know me, I need music to get through tedious tasks or else I get bored and stop working. I asked my sister if I could  borrow her, ‚Äúmy‚Äù, headphones. Honestly,  if I didn‚Äôt have music I probably wouldn‚Äôt have been able to finish, but that's not what this review is about. The headphones, my god, I have forgotten how awesome these headphones were. I was working on painting the room at least 8-10 hours a day for 3 days. Now it was just me doing this job. It included removing the furniture, removing posters, laying down the painters tarp, plastering up holes, putting painters tape, painting the room, and then putting everything back. These headphones lasted all 3 days without needing a recharge. I could hear my music clearly, the weight and padding made it comfortable to wear for long hours, and there were no wires to get in the way of work, overall great headphones.It was May 2017 when I bought my second pair. These lasted me all till the end of January 2018, but in all fairness I was using them everyday for 8-12 hours. I used them while exercising, while walking through campus, while studying, while cleaning, anytime I wasn‚Äôt talking to someone I would put them on. The thing that gave out was the battery, the headphones could no longer hold a charge after so many charging cycles. I talked to customer service and received a new pair of headphones for free, as these were still covered by the warranty.The customer service was in itself phenomenal. I was connected to an actual person within minutes, the problem  was explained and understood quickly, and the matter was taken care of almost instantly. I do not plan on buying other headphones as I think these are the best ones I have come across, especially for the price.
This works really well , good sound , comfortable on my head . My only complaint is that I have to turn my husbands on to turn my set on . If I am using mine and he wants to watch too I have to turn my set off so his will go on then turn my set back on .However they are worth it . Didn‚Äôt realize how much I was missing till I got them .
First off, I really like these headphones.  I bought them to replace a set of Idea V200 headphones, which were simply too heavy.  (Otherwise, they're pretty nice, and seem very well made.)What really attracted me to this listing was the generally good reviews, and advertised weight of 180 grams!  I was getting tired of my old wireless headphones pressing on my head, or slipping off / around if I wasn't just sitting still.  These Avantree Audition headphones sound great (I'm far from being an audiophile, but I've had some decent sound systems, and like a pretty wide range of music.)  If anything, these headphones seem much bassier than my previous ones, but I can't really say which one was more accurate.  It isn't distracting, just something to be aware of.They seem to be well made, and are generally pretty comfortable*.  I love the light weight, and the ear cups are actually big enough to go around my ears.  (My ears aren't huge, but probably on the larger side of "normal").  My one and only gripe so far is the the ear cups simply aren't deep enough to avoid having the tips of my ears press into the foam inner liner.  It isn't any big deal for an hour or so, but as time goes by, it gets more and more annoying, to the point where it's getting to be uncomfortable.  From some of the other reviews, this is a somewhat common problem, and Avantree apparently has deeper ear cups available. (Maybe -- see below).I say "apparently", because I can't quite get through their email based customer service.  I thought I accurately explained that I wanted to buy a set of "deeper" ear pads, but have been playing email tag over about a week now where they reply with some canned response of how I can return the headphones, or how they're assigning me an RMA number, or are sending me a new set of pads. (Regular, deeper? who knows -- I certainly don't).  All without ever actually admitting whether these deeper pads even exist.  I can't really fault their attempted helpfulness, but it doesn't seem like anyone actually read my email, or my three responses so far.  It seems like rather than "waste" 10 seconds reading my email, they would rather string this out over days and multiple emails.  I don't know if they're just swamped from the holiday rush, or their CS folks aren't native English speakers?  Either way, despite their good attitude and apparent intentions, they aren't actually helping me at this point.  (I remain hopeful, but so far I'd have to give their service 2 stars just based on how much of a run-around this is causing me, and them, when a simple "yes, here is how to order them", or even a "sorry, those are the only size we have" would have avoided all this trouble.)I the meantime, I just ripped the ~3/16" foam liner out of each ear cup, and put a loop of plastic tubing around the inside of each cup to space the pads out just a bit.  It's not *quite* perfect, but it's very close, and makes them comfortable for the 2-3 hours at a time I wear them.  If I do eventually get deeper pads from Avantree, I will update this review.  For now, these are 5 star headphones for folks with smaller or flatter ears, and maybe 3 stars for us Dumbos.Update 12/6/2018:  I've received another 3-4 email flurry of copied messages from a back and forth between their customer service, and what I assume is their supplier back in China.  No one actually addressed my questions directly, but it appears they are sending me deeper pads at no charge.  (2-3 week est. delivery.)  I will try to update this once they come in.  Overall,  I'm not quite sure how to rate their customer service.  They have helped me, and at no charge on what is already a pretty low priced item.  On the negative side, it's been a bunch of run-around and until the 7th or 8th email, I never actually got what could be considered an answer to my initial inquiry.
First pair lasted a little over a year and I was able to get a refund under warranty, repurchased and second pair only lasted less than 6 months, as now one side produces only static and the other is poor quality volume. It produces static noise even when not in use, unpaired, and shut down, which is unfortunate because I wanted to use the broken pair to muffle noise a bit.I bet my first pair would have lasted longer than a year if I did not consistently sleep with them on, so there's that. My second pair I was more careful with.For the second pair, part of me wonders if the poor lifespan was due to me having to use the cord, as my new phone no longer supported Bluetooth well and went in and out. (This is a common problem with my phone model, apparently, so I don't blame the headphones for the connection there.) I also speculate that not having it charged damaged it, or the fact that the cord had to be rotated in the socket to get both speakers to work on occasion. But I have no clue.Volume/pause feature is convenient but does not work when connected by cord.Does not have true "noise cancelling" technology, so if you have a need for good noise cancelling headphones look elsewhere.Sound quality is amazing and was consistent quality until they died.
The sounds quality is great and they're very comfortable.
Very comfy and could be alittle louder , but I'm hard of hearing need something for elderly with hearing problems.
I'm not an audiophile, and probably prefer too much bass in my music to be classed as one. That being said, I love these. They sound great, so much so that I'm having some trouble adapting back to my workout headset, and it's probably the most comfortable headset I've ever owned.Pros:-Good bass response without being overwhelming. I don't have any set tracks to listen to, but listen to a good amount of electronica, and I am very fond of Disturbed. This handles all of it without sounding washed out or tinny. I do keep the volume moderate, so can't speak for its response when pushed.-Comfortable. It's lightweight, so it can stay put without the vise effect, and doesn't create much of a "hot spot" on top of my head. I have a small to average head, so it might be less comfortable for someone with a large head. The headband isn't really padded, more of a leather-covered feel, but that doesn't bother me in this case. I wear glasses, and the ear cups are soft enough that it only barely moves them and doesn't cause pressure marks where the temples touch my head. I didn't know it was possible for an over-ear headset to get along so well with glasses and it gets a lot of points for that.-Solid battery life. I've had it for two or three weeks now, and it's still running on its initial charge. I don't use it every day, and not always for long when I do use it, but I'd say it's played at least twelve hours. I have not used the aux cable so I can't speak to that. It's also micro-USB, so it works nicely with a standard charger.-Easy pairing. I held the button down for ten or fifteen seconds on first use, and my phone found it immediately. I later switched to a different phone and was able to connect it without problems by holding the button until it spoke and then tapping my phone on the NFC symbol. I did turn off Bluetooth on the first phone before pairing the second.-It very clearly lets you know when it's on by playing a rather enthusiastic tone that's slightly longer than I'd prefer. It also has an indicator light, but it's small and non-obtrusive, and did not reflect off my glasses.-Good range. I left my phone in the living room and went into the laundry room; from probably 30 feet with two walls in between, there was a bit of static in the music, but it was still listenable. I have had no issues with it breaking up if I am in the same room, and it doesn't matter which side of my body it's on or whether it's on the coffee table.Cons:-After an hour or two, my ears begin to hurt. It presses a bit on the part that projects furthest from my head and I have tender ears (my pillow can leave them sore at times, to give you an idea). I can usually eke another 30-60 minutes out of them by fidgeting with the angles. I've never had a headset that didn't hurt, and I can tolerate this one far longer than most.-My ears get slightly warm, although for me that's more of a pro than a con since I'm often cold.-The ear cups don't rotate, and when I have them at the best angle, the headband is near the back of my head and will start to slide after awhile.-They stick out far enough to look a little goofy, in my opinion. I typically only wear them in the house so that's not a big deal.-They take so long to turn on that I start to wonder if they died before it plays the power on tone, and said tone is a bit obtrusive. I turn them on before putting them on so it isn't as loud.None of these are major cons, and I am very happy with this. I would definitely buy it again at the price; it was around $45 when I purchased.
This is my second pair of these.  My wife liked mine so much, she took them.  I liked them as well, so, I bought another pair.  The sound is fantastic, the bass is extremely good, and they stay charged for a long time.  Recharging is a little longer than I expected, but not enough to cramp my using them.  They are most comfortable and sit well on the head and ear.  Foam around the ear is soft out of the box, and forms a nice seal around the ear, lending to the very good bass rating.  Being that I have bought 2 pair of these, it‚Äôs obvious I love them.  The last reason is the cost.  Most times you get what you pay for, but dont let the cost of these sway you in thinking they can‚Äôt compete with headphones that cost well over $100.  These rock!  A great purchase, you wont be disappointed.

I really like them. They are light and the sound are great. The only complaint that I have is if I listen my music really loud then people around me can listen to my music.
Comfy, nice build, but needs higher volume output for when you want to crank up the music
These headphones feels like an aviation or NASA headsets for people works on operating flights etc., these looks very huge on head and looks feels weird to use these in office location. I used it for few days in my office and most of them looked at me with weird expressions‚Ä¶ not sure on what reference Logitech designed these headphones for office but does not work for all hopefully.
Lightweight, comfortable‚Ä¶ can be worn for long periods of time. Excellent blue tooth pairing and ideal for those needing to use for phone and video meetings. Music and other sound do sound great. Very good headphones for the price.
Thanks
I purchased this product because they advertised excellent dual microphone noise canceling. I expected there to be a drop in quality from my wired Logitech Zone 750 but this is terrible. I've been told it sounds like I'm in a tin can and they can hear my typing, air purifier, dog barking, cars passing. I've played with all the settings. Testing on a Dell XPS 950 Windows 10, MacBook 2018, Lenovo T540, Dell Latitude and the results are the same. The speakers are crap too. Save your money and do not but this product.
I ordered these to have a ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù secondary headset for music/movies/video calls while I work. My other headset I primarily use for gaming. I can say these are a great replacement for my gaming headset.The bass is good, punchy and no rattle. The highs are also great. Build quality is also great. It‚Äôs mainly plastic, but the plastic feels high quality and durable. I think what impressed me was the lack of weight. They are super light, without feeling cheap. I can wear them for hours on end with no complaints.I think my only cons are I wished they got a bit louder and the mic isn‚Äôt terrible, but I prefer my AirPod Pros. The mic itself is a little too tinny for my liking.
SO I had a chance to review these new logitech zone vibe 100 headset, and I gotta say, I didn't look at the price until I started writing this review. My answer to $99 is no way. I was thinking in my head $40 to $45. While I found the bass to be fine, and the lows fine, the BT leaves this headset with a lot to be desired. First off this is by no means a gamer headset. BT is a horrible medium for gaming sound, and to Logitech's benefit, no where on the box itself does it say gaming anywhere(Just inside). They are being billed as a phone, calls headset. Well I guess that is fine, but in a packed world of fantastic ear buds would you want these over those? I do not see the niche. And the $99 for a headset billed at lasting just 18 hours talk/ 20 hours listen. While I would say on a positive they are very light, The ear muffs just aren't that comfortable over ,more than 30 minutes. They don't breathe well so your ears get hot. They used 40mm drivers which surprisingly didn't do as bad as almost any other 40mm I have tried, it is still noticeable. I would take my $99 and get a nice pair of ear buds.
As expected from Logitech, this headset is well made and looks snazzy. The scope of delivery included a bag and charging cable (USB-C) as well as a quick start guide. Its light weight and fits perfect, at least on my head. Very comfortable even when worn for hours. Connecting via Bluetooth to a PC was very quick and easy. No additional drivers required. All the features you need for conference calling or listening to music are there and can be controlled via small buttons on the headset. A soft female voice gives feedback on the functions. The microphone on the side is foldable and is automatically muted when flipped up or vice versa when flipped down. The sound quality for conference calls is very good, as is the MICROPHONE noise cancellation. The sound quality for listening to music is well balanced, only the bass is a bit too rich, but most younger people like that. It's not a high-end headset for music enthusiasts, but it's a great all-rounder in my opinion. All in all it is a great device and I can only recommend it.
It was working perfectly fine on Zoom and quite comfortable, but when I switched to MS Teams, people could barely hear me.  I hadn't changed a thing in settings.  Going back I think.

I guess I should leave a review after buying 10+ of these over the years.  They're great; most of the time they come with one side longer than the other (by this point i think it's intentional) but i just bunch up the longer side and tape it.  I also have to replace them every few months -- usually the L side stops working suddenly, no matter how gently I use them.  The materials just aren't built to last.All that said, these are the only headphones I find comfortable & that I can wear with my hearing aids on.  Ultimately, they're what I stick with.
I got these for a persona 3 cosplay and they were really cool!! they bleed a lot so I wouldn‚Äôt wear them normally but I found them really comfortable and intricate!! came fast too
Pretty good for VR, be mindful that some head straps won‚Äôt work for these. The cords are also at different lengths
love them and would buy again
These work great with either In-the-ear or in-the-canal hearing aids!  No feedback and for the price, pretty amazing sound quality.  They look like they‚Äôre made somewhat cheaply and I expect a wire to short out eventually, but what do you expect for 12 bucks?  So small and portable, great to carry on commercial airplanes or to use for zoom meetings on the go with portable laptop and decent sound for music.  Won‚Äôt work with behind-the-ear hearing aids though.
They come in a small beautiful plastic packaging with instructions in Japanese. It turns out they are tiny - foam has less than 1.5 inches in diameter. Actually I have pretty small ears and still not covering much with them. Also, they look pretty fragile. It seems one has to be super careful to avoid damage. They are cheap in the end...I find the sound is not good, specifically for a region in the high frequencies that is overboosted. This brings a harsh sound and makes the S's of human voice sound too accentuated. It causes listening fatigue. Often it forces me to lower the volume, like these headphones are shouting to you.You wouldn't like to listen to music that already features some kind of distortion with these headphones. It's annoying.I've had clip headphones in the past which are more comforable and deliver a better sound than these ones. Unfortunately they are not very easy to find in the market.
I bought these to replace ones that Walmart stopped carrying. Panasonic has discontinued this item. These came from Korea.Earbuds hurt my ears, so these are a great lightweight option, especially if wearing for long lengths of time.Very inconspicuous for live streaming or video calls.
These are my go-to headphones. Bluetooth headphones seem to connect and disconnect randomly. When I want comfortable, reliable headphones these are the ones I turn to.
I needed something that could let in ambient sound without letting out too much music, for use in public (so, nothing properly open-back). These do this excellently and the sound quality and comfort are both good for what I paid.I have a Sony Xperia 5 II and tested with Mannheim Steamroller's "Toccata" and Miles Davis's "Jean Pierre," and these sound about as good as the earbuds that came with the phone, or maybe a bit better. There is not as much sub-bass as something that can make a proper seal with your ear, but this is expectable, and not a problem unless you're a huge basshead.These don't have a microphone or smartphone remote. You might consider this a negative, but I actually like it because it lets me use the headphones with older audio devices (e.g., a portable CD player) that only have three-pole jacks and don't work properly with the four-pole plug that a microphone requires.The feeling is weird at first, but you get used to it quickly, and it doesn't get fatiguing in the same way as most portable on-ear headphones do. I could probably wear these for several hours before they started to bother me, and they stay in place when I move around, which is good.I wouldn't expect durability to be great. The cord is thin (although definitely not the thinnest I've seen), and the headphones themselves are plasticky and very light. They should survive the occasional drop but probably not any kind of serious abuse. For the price, this is fine; if I can get six months or so out of one pair then I would consider that my money's worth.
Good enough for meüôèBetter than paying $100-$300 for the over priced stuff üòâ

I've owned these about nine months now.  I'm a huge audio nerd, and I love these headphones!Quick points:-  frequency response is incredible.-  you won't need a DAC -- they're very sensitive (efficient).-  sub-bass is present, if a little quiet, but-  they can take MASSIVE amounts of sub-bass if EQ'd-  great for people who are sensitive to treble-  they're really comfortable -- I can wear them for hours, with glasses-  their floppiness takes some getting used to-  they isolate sound pretty well-  you'll want to buy a different cable (there's an awesome 1.2m braided one on Amazon for $12)They sound /so/ flat.  ("flat" here refers to a graph of their frequency response, where a "flatter" graph gives a sound that's de-emphasized across the frequency spectrum -- it doesn't make some notes too loud and others too soft, just reproduces them exactly as they were recorded.)  They respond to EQ really well, but I don't feel the need to use EQ on any part of the range besides sub-bass (and only for trap, future bass, etc.).  Of course, their response isn't the most even and flat (according to professional measurements I've found), but it's really, really great.  What is emphasized makes detail (2kHz to 6kHz) just a little more present, without being harsh.  To my ears, a lot of headphones in this price range and higher sound too harsh because they emphasize treble too much.  I had that concern with these at first, but for my ears, they're right on the edge without going overboard -- just about perfect.You can practically use them as speakers with a mobile device -- they're that sensitive.  You definitely don't /need/ to use a DAC with these.I love sub-bass.  I listen to a lot of trap, future bass, and misc. edm where the subbass really needs to speak.  These headphones start to roll off around 70Hz, but not so drastically to where these styles aren't enjoyable without an EQ.  I could go without EQ on these headphones, but I don't.  What's great about these is that you can throw all the sub-bass boost you want at them and they still perform superbly.  I use as much as +25dB at 31Hz (on a 29-band EQ) and they handle it excellently.  In that regard, I give in before they do.  I recommend AIMP if you're on Android so you can dial in the bass just how you want it, if you're into that sort of thing.With other types of music and with podcasts, audiobooks, etc, I don't even think to use EQ with these headphones.  Acoustic instruments never sounded so good before, or so true-to-life.  And with podcasts, you can really hear the differences in the different microphones people use; it's incredible.They're really comfortable for me.  I have a large head and I wear glasses half the time, and even while wearing glasses, I can wear these headphones for hours at a time with minimal fatigue.  The earpads and headband are nice and soft, and the earpads reach all the way around large ears.  My partner has a small head and seems to find them comfortable, though they can slide around a bit on their head.  When I'm moving around a lot, I find I need to really tighten them up to get them to grip when I tilt my head down.  This became a non-issue for me as I got accustomed to them.Due to the flexible nature of the design, they are especially floppy.  You really can't pick them up quite like normal headphones, and putting them on is necessarily a two-handed affair.  The first time I picked these up at a demo, they seemed to abandon my hands.  You can't pick them up by one earcup and slip them on one-handed.  I find I have to grab both cups or both ends of the headband and then put them on.  But that's intentional.  Sometimes you want to just pick up one ear and listen for just a second, like when you're trying to dial in something in a recording.  For that purpose, the rest of the headphones fall to the side out of the way, and it's very convenient.  I was actually frustrated by this at first, but after using them for some time in several different scenarios, I'm glad for the flexibility.Other design notes: they seem durable and they've never appeared to even start breaking.  I am gentle with my equipment, and I kept from forcing the hinges when the headphones would flop out of my hands for the first week I used them.  I absolutely love that they fold up.  This is eminently convenient for putting them in bags and taking them places.The sound isolation is pretty good.  Even on airplanes I've found that I don't have to turn the volume up too much.  They easily block out conversations and even that one guy who doesn't know he talks too loudly.  Adding bass seems to help this.The cable situation is pretty bad.  It's kind of weird to include two giant studio-length cables with headphones that will also be bought by average consumers.  That being said, I bought a compatible braided cable on Amazon for $12, and it's awesome.  It locks into the headphones, it's just the right length for everyday use, and it seems really durable.  You'll probably want to buy one if you ever move your headphones from your desk.I really love these headphones, and I highly recommend them for all purposes.
I have been using mid-priced headphones since the 60's. These headphones have been a good choice, a bargain really. The included choice of cables was really nice. I use these when watching things on my computer so as not to bother others nearby. I am very happy with how well movies and music sound, and with the long-term comfort this product offers. These headphones muffle surrounding sounds a bit, but I can still sense my surroundings. I have noticed that many pros on You-Tube use these as "studio" headphones. That seems to confirm my feelings that these were a very good choice in headphones....great price too. I did black-tape mine to stop the "swivel" movement, they are perfect now.
I know the frequency response is TECHNICALLY better on the M50x, but for me I just like the sound of the M40x way more. I would definitely recommend trying to find some place to listen to both of them in person and making your decision, but for the price difference I would recommend these over the M50x especially to someone on a tighter budget. I've been using these for well over a year now and I love them, never had a single issue. The locking headphone cable is a nice touch, and I appreciate how long the cable is and that you also get a telephone-style coiled cable as well if you need a shorter one.The only thing that is annoying about them is that you can't just use any standard 3.5mm cable, it seems like it HAS to be the ones that come with these. IF you're someone who gets cables shredded for one reason or another frequently, you may want to either stay away from these and go with something that can be replaced more easily, or buy a bunch of extras if AT sells them individually (I honestly haven't checked). If you take care of your gear though, I really don't think you'll have an issues.
I bought these 4 maybe 5 years ago, its my first time investing in a pair of Audio Technica's but i used to own a pair of Sony MDR750's which at the time for the price i did not believe you could get a better pair of headphones for the price range, however after 5 years of use i'm here to tell you that so these have been the best pair of headphones i've ever owned, i use them for everything, in music production, balancing and mixing / mastering, casual listening, and i take them on my 8 mile runs and get them dirty ... Never once have they failed on me, nothing has broken off, and they sound as good as they day i got them, they fit snug over my ears like a glove and they don't abuse my ears after long sessions and honestly if you want even better ear support you can buy custom earcups that'll really bring the experience of owning these ten fold but the standard ones are well built, the sound is leveled and there's not much coloration going on giving you a crystal clear yet loud full surround sound, the clarity is honestly really impressive, in most cases headphones that are acoustically flat that deliver an honest clear sound tend to lack in the low end but these are the exception to the rule, honestly i'm actually thinking of buying a second pair just to stash away just in case but to be honest i don't know when that day will come because no matter the time of day, no matter where i am, no matter what i ask of it ... it steps up to the plate and continues to deliver a quality sound that just blows my mind, i cannot believe the price on these pair of headphones ... I feel like the only person who got cheated here was Audio Technica for the price lol.
There are more expensive and better monitoring headphones out there but this has a nice balance of frequencies, is comfortable and affordable.  I tried the Sony but the highs were too sibilant and painful after a time.  I could wear these for hours.  The variety of cords and the pouch are nice features.  The detachable cords mean that a fault in the cord doesn't mean you have to buy new headphones, just the cord.  I use them for practice with my keyboards, harmonicas and vocals.  I even used them in a performance and they blocked out the stage sounds nicely.  The sound on stage was very loud and these helped. Highly recommended.
These are the little brother to the Audio-Technica ATH-M50 headphones.  Are they AS good, no, but very close behind and leave a little more change in your pocket.  I believe the digits indicate the diameter of the drivers; 50mm or 40mm.  Yes, you can hear the background bass clearly.
I've used the M50Xs for the past 6 years and they've been incredible, but they're now super glued in 3 spots due to heavy use. It was time for a new pair, and I've read and heard that the M40Xs are better, if not on par with the M50Xs. It's only been a few days with them, but I have to say, it's all true. All the sound quality, comfortability, and closed-back noise isolation is here for $50 less. I'm not really an audiophile, but I like music and I feel like I'm actually able to pick up more detail on these than my M50Xs. My main use for these is gaming, and they have great directional imaging for footsteps and gunshots and whatnot. If you're on the fence between the 40s and the 50s, save the money! Get these, you won't be disappointed.
I use these with my digital piano.  They are comfortable and the sound is accurate and without any change.  The over-the-ear style keeps out sufficient household noise and there isn't much bleed of the piano to others in the next room.  I like the straight cord which I can tuck behind me.  The curled was a bit too heavy for me.
They sound pretty good. The detachable cable is a nice feature but the hinges on mine broke after about 2 years. They also feel kind of cheap.
Love these! If I wear them for a few hours on end, they do get a little sweaty on the cups. They are also a little heavy compared to other headphones I've tried, but comfortable still. The two cables are great, and I love the sound quality for gaming, video editing, listening to music, watching movies, etc.
https://www.amazon.com/Bowers-Wilkins-Cancelling-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B07574TYWW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews
First this is a written copy of my video review, which can be found on youtube under the title "Bowers & Wilkins PX - The Wireless Headphones to Beat in 2018" If you would like to watch that rather than read, then head to youtube and copy and paste that title into the search engine. And as always thank you for the support. Below is my written review.Hello Ladies & Gentlemen, Devon from Dcon here and these are Bowers & Wilkins PX wireless headphones. They are noise-cancelling headphones and they weigh 335 grams. Bluetooth 4.1 is built-in and these headphones are APTx HD compliant.The battery life ranges between 22-29 hours and USB Type-C is implemented for recharging. These headphones and are very low key and modern. I have the space grey version, which allows it to be even more minimalistic, but there is also a blue and gold variant that is a bit more exuberant if that‚Äôs your thing. Each cup rotates 135 degrees giving the headphones a foldable design making it easy to pack away into the carrying pouch. The outer cups and headband are covered in this checkered fabric, while the inner earcups and headband is constructed of memory foam and are enclosed in a soft leather material. The memory foam and leather are really nice and allow the headphones to be extremely comfortable. The circumference of the earpads is a bit on the small side. They‚Äôre fine for my ears, but I could see this being a problem for others as it may cause some discomfort. The headband is adjustable and can be extended by simply pulling each side downward. The speaker wire is nicely covered in a nylon-braided cover and runs along each adjustable rod. While in design this looks great, in practicality it is a poor design-choice as they will likely get damaged if you get caught in the rain. Back to the ear cups for a second, this plastic piece here is more than just a branding opportunity; it also covers the rear part of the speaker. This allows the headphones to be a closed-back headphone opposed to an open-back headphone.So you may be thinking Devon why do I care if my headphones are closed-back? Well one reason is they help limit noise from leaking out of the headphone as well as preventing noise from coming in. This is nice for when you are in a crowded area such as a coffee shop and you don‚Äôt want to disturb or be disturbed by anyone around you. Closed-back headphones also provide you with a more confined soundstage which allows for a more intimate listening experience, whereas open-back headphones allow for a much more expansive soundstage. Think of this as seeing a concert at a much smaller venue such as Lincoln Hall versus a much larger venue such as the Red Rocks. The main reason why these are close-backed though is to implement the noise-cancelling feature, which I‚Äôll talk about further in a minute.Along the right earcup is where all the functionality lies. The power button doubles as the Bluetooth pairing button. Holding the button down for a few seconds sends the headphones into pairing mode, where up to 8 devices can be remembered. To turn the headphones off, you slide the power button to the left. Interestingly enough, B&W does not recommend turning the headphones off, they recommend letting the headphones go into standby mode. After a few minutes of no activity the headphones will go to sleep. This actually works quite well as the battery holds a fantastic charge while in standby and is just one less thing you have to worry about when taking them off.Just above the power button is the ‚Äúenvironmental mode‚Äù button. This activates the noise-cancelling feature. There is three sensitivity options for noise-cancellation, all of which are accessible via B&W‚Äôs phone application. Airline is the most aggressive of the three, as it attempts to cancel out any external engine noise. The noise-cancellation works well, but is nowhere near as aggressive or effective as Bose‚Äôs quiet-comfort series, which virtually cut out all sound around you. This can be a good or bad thing depending on your preference, I personally prefer the less aggressive approach of these headphones. The included three modes are a nice touch, but I honestly couldn‚Äôt tell a major difference between them. The noise-cancellation is great when in a noisier environment, but I recommended leaving it off when you are in a quiet environment as the sound is degraded some and your battery will discharge at a slightly faster rate with it activated.The remaining buttons are your standard volume up, volume down and play/pause in between. The play button also doubles as a track selector. Pressing it twice will move to the next track, while pressing it three times will select the previous track. With the headphones on, there is a slight learning curve with all of the buttons. The play button is slightly raised to differentiate it from the volume up and down, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs enough to minimize mistakes. After extended use, you‚Äôll get used to it, but I just personally think it could have been better designed. Spacing the buttons apart and texturizing the play/pause button would have been ideal.Since these headphones are Bluetooth, they‚Äôre capable of receiving calls. To answer a call, you simply press the play button. To reject a call you simply hold the play button down. In terms of call quality it was slightly awkard hearing the person I was talking to. The connection and quality was fine, but their voice was really muffled. The included microphone does a nice job however and everyone I talked to reported positive feedback on call quality.Located toward the bottom is the 3.5mm headphone port and the USB type-c port. Both are capable of listening to music via a wired connection. The USB type-c cable allows you to listen to music and charge at the same time. These are convenient options if you wanted to use a device that is not APTx HD compliant and you wanted to listen to lossless music, otherwise they kind of defeat the purpose of wireless headphones.Before I talk about the sound quality, I wanted to quickly mention the battery. It is a 850mAh lithium-ion rechargeable battery and it is fantastic. B&W is touting 22 hours of battery life when using noise-cancellation and 29 hours when only using the headphones wirelessly. During my testing I was able to get around 20 hours with noise cancellation and 26 hours without it. All while allowing the cans to go into standby mode in between.Alright now on to what really matters: the sound. These headphones are APTx HD compliant and in short APTx HD means these wireless headphones can receive lossless audio from any compatible device. This is insane, because lossless audio was only available via a wired connection due to their large file size and now with the APTx HD codec, lossless audio is available via wireless connections.For anyone unfamiliar with lossless audio, essentially this is audio without any compression. Audio printed on CD‚Äôs for example is completely lossless. While music streamed from Pandora, spotify or purchased from iTunes is all compressed. Compressed audio is bad because you end up losing a lot of the fidelity that makes music so amazing.Alright now I will actually talk about the quality of sound these headphones produce. These headphones sound really, really good. They hit low enough to make bass feel substantial without bottoming out or sounding boomy. The midrange is nice and accurate, while the treble is a little on the bright side and can cause some minor ear fatigue after long listening sessions. The soundstage presented is a bit constrained and that is a limitation of the closed-back design, but the actual separation of instruments is really nice. By this I mean there is nice clarity among different instruments on a track when they are all playing at once. For example, you‚Äôre able to differentiate a guitar from a bass guitar all while hearing a tambourine off in the distance when listening to ‚ÄúNew Slang‚Äù by The Shins. Instruments don‚Äôt necessarily sound as true to life as you‚Äôll find on more expensive headphones and that‚Äôs only due to the limitations of the drivers implemented, which is honestly expected for any headphone under $500 dollars.Overall the sound is very impressive and in my opinion is the best sounding wireless headphone available in 2018.If you‚Äôre like me and you want a minimalistic wireless headphone without compromising on compressed audio, then this is absolutely the headphone for you. Not only is lossless audio possible with these, but the battery life is incredible and they are very comfortable for extended periods of time. The noise-cancellation is implemented nicely, although it is not as aggressive as Bose‚Äôs quiet-comfort series. So if noise-cancellation is your main priority for flights, work or studying and you don‚Äôt care about lossless audio capabilities, then go with the quietcomforts. But if you care about sound quality first and foremost, these are your guys!
I'm really liking these so far. This is just from a few hours of listening to music today, about 4 hours I would say. I did quite a bit of research on these and they weren't my first choice. I already own the Plantronics Back Beat Pro 2's since June of 2017 and the Audio Technica ATH-DSR7BT since October of 2017 and I've been happy with them both. I auditioned the Bose QC35 back in June of 2017 and decided on the BB Pro 2's. The Bose to my ears just didn't let the music come through, made me feel like I was in a "pressure cabin" or something and I couldn't even switch ANC off. Anyway I wanted another pair of ANC headphones to rotate in my daily listening. In the morning after checking my HRV the headphones go on and I actually wash my face and brush my teeth with them on, I do take them off before I shower. I was going to sell the Audio Technica but couldn't find a reason, to me they really let the music come through. I like the way the BB Pro 2's sound too, although they can be a little heavy on the bass, but the music is enjoyable and the Pro 2's are feature rich.Now to add another set of ANC cans to my rotation I had Sony WH1000xm2 in mind. I actually ordered them and while they were on the way to me I kept reading about the cracking head band piece so when they got here I picked them up from UPS and didn't even bother to open the box and just sent them back. I also considered the Sennheiser PXC 550 but decided not to get those because they didn't support AAC (I own the Senn HD-700 wired as well as the Senn HD-598 wired just for reference). Although I do have an Android phone that supports aptX and aptX HD this is the phone I run and exercise with. Now I did do some comparisons between my iPhone using AAC and the Android phone using aptX HD and to be honest I couldn't hear the difference, maybe it's my old ears or something but the music I listened to sounded good using either codec on either phone. Anyway even if I couldn't hear the difference I wanted something that supported all the codecs out there, who knows, maybe I'll experience a miracle and be able to here the difference one day, in other words I want to be ready even if I don't get to go!So I ordered the B&W PX's (B&W is what we called the company back when their 801 reference speakers hit the scene). B&W, like Audio Technica as well as Sennheiser has a history of making various devices, equipment in the audio reproduction/recording industry (I guess Bose too with their in the corner 901's I think?). Anywho I got my PX's today and I love them and read that they get better after some burn in time, who knows?. The first thing I did was plug them in, turn them on, connect them to the app and update the firmware. So far everything has been going smooth. The only thing I kind of dislike is the power button. Why not a regular slider or rocker switch that stays in the position of off or on? Other than that it's pretty straight forward. The music shines, just comes through on my iPhone X. I have to say to my ears the PX's are on the neutral side of the spectrum, where as the BB Pro 2's are on the "warm" leaning towards a fatter bottom end. The ATH7's are more neutral as well. the PX's and the ATH7's to my ears are really close in their presentation. This is just my initial observation and opinion and like I said to my ears and perceived matched volume level. I did notice that on a particular recording (India Arie) there's some distortion (bass riff) in the recording that I had not noticed until listening to the PX's. I first thought that something was wrong so I went to the ATH7's and heard the same thing, but not as pronounced as on the PX's. Don't know why, maybe it's because of the different sensitivity between the two cans. I didn't listen on the BB Pro 2's yet but will and maybe I'll add more to this note of my experience.I also read that to some the clamping force or fitment of the headband on the PX's were a little uncomfortable to them, to me they're just fine. I didn't experience any heating up of the ear cuffs around my ears either. I'm a big sweater, I perspire just sitting around so It'll be interesting this summer but I do have air conditioning in my home, thank goodness :). I don't expect any problems. I've used my BB Pro 2's while cutting my grass but not sure if I'll bring my PX's outside use while cutting grass. anyway over the last few months I've acquired some really good sounding LG and Sony earbuds that have passive noise cancelling that I use when I run outdoors so the Pro 2's are relieved of outdoor duty too. As far as comfort I would say the ATH7's then the BB Pro 2's then the PX's. This could change in time after I get used to them and or the pads get softer or broken in. The pads or ear cups can easily be replaced on the PX's too so who's to say that B&W won't make some that are softer. The PX's are keepers for me! I forgot to mention the ear pads/cuffs fit over my ears (ears are inside the cuffs) and form a perfect seal.Update: 3/12/18: Very revealing. If it's a good recording then then that's what I hear. Listening to a compilation of female vocalists. Natalie Merchant; "Cowboy Romance", layered, open and her husky voice is right there. Instruments, not sure what they are but could some kind of synth sounding like maybe an organ, violins and some stringed instruments are very harmonic. India Arie; "The One" another very good sounding recording to me. Nice bass lines, guitar strumming and everything just sounds so good. Her mature silky voice just comes through. I noticed on Norah Jones "What am I to You" sounds a little vailed, not as open as the first 2 I mentioned. I believe this is more to do with the recording. Her voice is still immediate and sounds very good. Organs, drums and guitar are very noticeable but the recording itself is just not as open and airy, still sounds good though. Sarah Bariellas "Love Song" sounds pretty open and well recorded, her voice is just right there along with the piano and accompanying instruments, drums, guitar etc. right there. Alanis Morissette "All I Really Want", her squeaky high pitched voice and rhythmic drums, and what sounds like an harmonica and organ, just have to move, pat my feet!. Just a sample of how enjoyable these are to me. I listen to a wide variety of music, to the above mentioned to "Red Hot Chili Peppers", "Sheryl Crow", "Adele", "Maroon 5", "Parliament/Funkadelic" and on and on. Just love what I call music and the different expressions. And the added features of the PX's are a plus. I haven't used the various filters a lot but just played around with them and to my ears they don't distract much from the music and works pretty good. I don't use the "proximity sensor" thing, I don't really care for it on the BB Pro 2's either so I leave it off, on both headphones. I like the position of the controls and they work pretty good, as I said I don't care for the on/off button, it order for me to get it to work right I have to hold the headset in my hands, so turning them on and off I'm holding them, not a problem though, just the way it is for now. Maybe it'll change once I'm used to it. So that's it. I'm done. These are excellent to me. Like I said, "Revealing" , what you got (recording) is what you hear. Also I'm using Tidal HiFi downloaded recordings to my iPhone X. I haven't listened with my Android (LG G5) yet but mainly use that for exercising, running and gym but I'll get around to connecting them to it sooner or later. Sorry for the rant, hopefully you can get my point.
I'm an audiophile that has a daily train commute, so I'm coming from a place of needed excellent sound, portability, fit and battery life.*I disagree with other reviewers on the app and pairing process. Couldn't be simpler. Follow instructions, read what the buttons do, download the app, have a decent phone. Mine's a Pixel 2 XL and it works flawlessly.*** No issues with automatic play and stop, it works perfectly for me and I wear "hipster" glasses...**1. Sound Quality: The PX, like any headphone, will sound best with ANC off. They have a wider sound stage and fuller lower mids with ANC off. It's not at all bad when ANC is on, it's just noticeable, I'd say it goes from a 10 to around a 7 from none to heavy Airplane ANC.To be clear I say 10 because these sound amazing. I would rank these a 10, Bose QC35 a 7, and Senheisser HD1 an 8. These are the best sounding bluetooth high end headphones I've owned.-Bass is punchy and boomy, but not muddy or over done. Low end is perfection from listening to classic West Coast Jazz to EDM, these are never overbearing.-Mids are where these are surprisingly excellent, a lot of typical on the go headphones like beats etc scoop the mids extremely aggressively, I'm assuming to make more headroom for an obnoxiously muddy bass presence. Think smiley face EQ.The PX don't do that, they have perfect, boomy when you want it to be bass, but don't lose the mids. This is clear in classical, some indie rock, and jazz. Everything is there, I can hear all the instruments whereas other headphone brands that squash the mids lose instruments.-Highs are tame, they're not shrill and brash or tinny like some headphones are. These are perfection. They're crisp and add presence without assaulting your ears. Singers with a lot of sibilance in their voice won't rip your head off with these. Cymbals are crisp but not crunchy, it's all there and it's wonderful.Overall, no these aren't "reference" headphones, they aren't flat. They have a very tasteful and purposeful curve that's meant to make music enjoyable, thunderous when it should be, airy when it can be, never intrusive. Perfection.2. Active Noise Canceling: The PX have 3 ANC modes: Office, City, Flight. *Side note; the seal that the large ear cups make around your ears provide a lot of noise cancellation on their own to be honest*- Office mode is the lightest ANC and sounds fantastic. Really, this is the setting to use 90% if you want to. It's also very easy to toggle ANC on and off with the touch of a button, on the right earphone. Office mode is good for well, an office that's chatty, blocking out a mechanical keyboard, coffee shop, but it's versatile. I honestly leave it on the office setting and it does a fine job even walking around downtown Seattle, or taking a bus or train. Only an ambulance or yelling will make it past.- City mode and Flight mode are much more aggressive amounts of cancellation. You will hear this effect the sound quality and it will be slightly negative. It's also not really necessary unless you're around construction or on a plane or in an airport, somewhere EXTREMELY loud.On the extreme end the PX block out a little less noise than the Bose QC35, but are better than the Sony 1KX and the Senheisser HD1.3. Wireless Features: Bluetooth 5 and AptX sound brilliant, can't hear a physical difference between wired and wireless. The connection is solid, unlike other headphones that cut out when crossing a busy street, these do not.I haven't had any issues with the automatic play and stop via the sensor in the ear cup. It works flawlessly for me (maybe others were on older firmware?) and I wear glasses.The buttons on the side are awesome, responsive, intuitive, easy to reach.4. Comfort: These are lighter and more comfortable than the Senheisser HD1's but they're heavier than a pair of beats or the QC35. Fit is just as good as QC35, same comfort level. Even being a wearer of eye glasses I wear these for about 2-3 hours a day without issue. Sometimes up to 4 hours at a time.Conclusions: These are the headphones for someone that doesn't want to make ANY compromises.-Sound quality is unmatched, these are the best of the best-Wireless and features are on point-Comfort is on par with other headphones-Battery life is great, charge with USB C instead the dreaded micro USB cable.These are hands down the best.
I've had these soft gold PX for a month now, so they're fully broken in and I've had a chance to evaluate all aspects of them.Sound quality: 10/10There's no way around it: these headphones are the best sounding Bluetooth set on the market at this price point, and it's clear to me why B&W took so long to bring it to market. Even with noise canceling on in its most aggressive setting, these headphones deliver tight, punchy lows, warm and full mids, and crisp highs. With my iTunes equalizer on flat (because with perfect fidelity there's no need for an EQ) I can hear every detail that the sound engineers intended me to. Bass doesn't drown out everything, the mids are present but never overbearing, and the highs - just wow. Every cymbal crash in Iron Maiden's greatest hits, every warble in Whitney Houston's epic voice, every tropic keystroke of Kygo's keyboard, perfectly reproduced, all elements of the sound balanced and none demanding more attention than the other. These are a balanced set, and if you're looking for something that will provide more kick to your EDM or heavy metal, look into something else. That's not to say those genres dont sound fantastic on the PX - they absolutely do - but I find myself gravitating toward classical, general rock, and downtempo electronic in search of every last detail of my favorite songs in those genres I may have missed on my lesser headphones. The PX encourage musical discovery. And rediscovery.Comfort: 6/10The biggest tradeoff for that sound quality is comfort. PX was designed so that it's most premium sound would be without the noise canceling turned on. To achieve this, B&W decided on a tight seal, making the ear cups a bit on the firmer side and the headband a bit tighter than I would expect to pass muster in testing for a product at this price point. Additionally, the padding on the headband is not exactly accommodating. It's not terrible by any means, but after about three hours of continuous wear I find myself needing to take a break to allow the sore spot on the top of my head to disappear. It almost seems as though the PX are demanding your attention, as though B&W made the conscious decision to scale back on comfort (that is so obviously a trademark in its main competitor the Bose QC35) to remind you you're listening on a seriously premium set, so you'd better pay attention. Very British, right?Noise canceling: 8.5/10I bought these primarily for the sound quality, and noise canceling by its nature is inherently compromising to sound quality. That said, the ability to fine tune noise canceling strength to suit your surroundings and allow voices to pass through while listening to music is a cool and welcome feature. Although the counterfrequency in the highest setting is pretty aggressive, the noise canceling on this set is utterly isolating.Design: 10/10Beautiful, understated, and constructed of the highest quality materials (machined aluminum, high quality plastics, ballistic nylon, and real leather) make this a beautiful and contemporary alternative to competitors, and perfect for those who see headphones as something of a status symbol and would rather not be absorbed by the masses with Beats and Bose headsets. Soft carrying case is nice if not exactly protective.Battery life and connectivity: 9.5/10A stated 22 hours with noise canceling turned on. I have no doubt that this claim is accurate, and the iOS/Android app will provide you with the exact percentage remaining. Recharge time is quick. Bluetooth connection is strong, and I have no issue maintaining a connection with my iPhone between walls, or up to 60 unobstructed feet away. I've had these connected to three devices at once and experienced no untoward behavior. Only two dropped connections in the time Ive owned these, and easily fixed by a firmware update. The smart power management feature and auto-pausing is cool, although I wish there were more options for customizability.All in all, if you are seriously considering parting with $400 for a pair of headphones, you need to love music a whole lot, or these will not seem worth it. That almost certainly means you need a subscription to Spotify, Tidal or Apple Music to wring the full potential out of this set. These won me over because of brand pedigree, beautiful and differentiated design, and utterly amazing sound quality. Just challenge yourself if you do take the plunge, and make the foray into music outside of your day-to-day. Listen carefully for the details, and it will make more sense why good sound costs so much.
I was looking for a replacement for my 2016, Sony MDR-1000X (1st generation) noise cancelling headphones and picked up these Bowers & Wilkins PX along with a pair of Sony WH-1000XM2s as potential replacements.The 1000XM2's are the successor to the 1000X's and, to me, seemed identical with the exception of a pair new Sony apps that allow for detailed customization of noise cancelling and equalizer settings.  The 1000XM2's were as comfortable as my old 1000X's and they sounded the same (excellent noise cancelling and good sound quality).  The only thing that stopped me from pulling the trigger on the 1000XM2's was the fact that I'm not 100% confident that Sony has addressed the reason I'm in the market for replacement headphones in the first place -- build quality.  My original 1000X's right arm developed a crack and eventually snapped right off and despite claims online that Sony has addressed the issue with a different type of plastic on the 1000XM2's, the plastic doesn't seem sturdy enough or reinforced enough to support the loads at the joints where the cracking happens (just compare the hinge joints and arms of the Bose Quiet Comfort II's to see what "confidence-inspiring" plastic looks and feels like).So why did I settle on the Bowers & Wilkins PX?  The construction looks and feels rock solid; the device is built from metal, leather and some plastic (the base of the earcups, and possibly the guides for the arms).  The whole thing looks like it's bullet-proof (in fact the coverings for the earcups and the top of the headband is actually made of ballistic-grade nylon), the metal hinges swivel confidently, the arms extend and retract with the right amount resistance and I am 100% sure that these headphones won't snap on me.Ok, but nobody buys headphones for build quality alone.  Sonically, the PX's sound great when NC is turned off (better than the Sony's), there's just so much more detail in sound that is transmitted on these headsets compared to the 1000XM2's.  Here's an example: if you listen to Annie Lennox's "Little Bird" from 0:30 to 0:35 you'll hear a synth harp play from left to right; on the PX, the individual notes sound more distinct and brighter -- not artificially so.  The same track segment doesn't sound as clear and distinct on the Sony's regardless of whether noise cancelling is turned on or off.In terms of noise cancelling, the 1000XM2's win the battle hands down.  My belief is that the B&W's depend quite a bit on passive noise attenuation (with active noise cancelling maybe accounting for 30-40%) -- which explains all the complaints about the earcup seal and clamping force for this headset since combined this would ensure physical sound isolation.  You aren't going to get isolation chamber levels of silence with the PX's; for that, you'd be better off looking at the Bose QC 35s or the Sony's.  I'd say the B&W's are probably 80% as effective as the Sony's at noise cancelling -- I can still hear conversations in the office with the PX's regardless of whether I put them on Office, City or Flight modes... moreso than the Sony's ever let in.All in all are the Bowers & Wilkins PXs worth the money that I spent on them?  Yes.  The sound quality is better than on the Sony's and while the NC isn't as effective, I think the sound quality combined with the build quality gives these headphones a distinct edge in my books (especially if the price difference is less than $70).Nice touches:- The Bowers & Wilkins logos machined on the earcups are written vertically, so that if you rest the earcups on the top of your head, they read left-to-right- The armband, arms and joints are all-metal construction- You can listen to audio through the usb-c connectionAreas for improvement:- The auto-pause feature (lifting an earcup) doesn't pause YouTube or other browser-based streaming apps- If you weren't listening to iTunes before you activate auto-pause by lifting up an earcup, when you place the earcup back, it'll play whatever track iTunes was last on- Sony and Bose rivalling levels of noise cancellation would be welcomed
These are difficult to review.  It feels like the majority of the major positive and negatives are all true, even the conflicting ones.  I think all wireless headphones are going to have some tradeoffs, and these are no exception.  They aren't for everyone, but I've decided I'm very happy and will be keeping them.Build quality is immaculate.  They're smaller than you think from photos, but still pretty heavy.  I don't think I have large ears, but I need to sort of wiggle them over my lobes and settle them in.  But they do fit.  I find them to be a very tight fit, almost to the point of discomfort from the vice pressure, but they never quite hit painful and I can wear them for hours.  Through the shear joy of listening to them, I'm not consciously aware they're on my head the entire time.  It can take a while to forget they're on, though.These are my first active noise cancelling headphones, so I can't speak to comparisons to other headsets.  I can say as expected, ANC does negatively impact sound quality, but I think that's par for the course with any ANC?  They have pretty solid passive noise cancelling just by the nature of their build, I haven't really felt the need to use ANC either in the office or while on the streets walking my dog.  Obnoxious cube neighbors are even why I bought headphones with ANC in the first place!There is a slight hiss when using the audio cable, but it's consistent and low and gets lost in all but the quietest of music.  I don't think needing battery life to have audio with ANC off and wired is going to be a problem for me in any way, but it is something to consider and seems to be a trade-off from the engineers that I'm not fond of anyway.  It isn't a deal breaker for me, but could be for some.The sound quality takes some time to adjust to and is heavily dependant on the source quality.  I wish they sounded like my Grados,  but alas nothing sounds like Grados.  These are not forgiving to poor quality sources. The same song through Pandora can sound muffled, while I felt like I was at the stage through other sources.  Vocals can sound muffled at times, but I think that's due to the source or recording quality again.  But I have to say,  either they're breaking in or I am, and even that first time I started listening, they threw a huge smile on my face.These have an mazing sound stage.  I listened to a headphone test audio and at first I thought I was hearing my neighbors.  Individual instruments stand out, spatial positioning is immaculate.The app is annoying and garbage, but it's usable.  Just a shame you need it to adjust the ANC settings and levels for the auto proximity sensing.That reminds me, I haven't had any problems with the proximity sensor auto pause/play.  I think with so much of life, everyone is going to feel differently about it.  It's been pretty natural to me and hasn't had any false pauses.The physical controls are well built and make sense.  Well, except for the Bluetooth/on/off button (until you read the instructions). The same button is used for Bluetooth on/off, pairing, and power on/off.  It's both a push button and spring loaded slider.  Slide down and release for. On/off.  Push in to turn Bluetooth on/off, and push in and hold to pair.  The pause/next/prev works s advertised.  Push once for pause/play, twice for next track, thrice for prev track.Battery life seems to be solid.  I haven't done any timings or comparisons with ANC on and off, but I've been listening for hours without having to think about it.Again, I'm happy with these, I have decided I like their sound and the for is actually good for me. The build is great and they're simple enough to use.  All current wireless headphones have tradeoffs, and the B&W PX fits well in my world.
Aight I've had these for like half a year now. Sound-wise they're the best wireless noise cancelling headphones you can get. There's not really a competitor. The Bose equivalents sound like tin cans compared to these. I've had a few ups and downs with them just because they're expensive for headphones, but in terms of what you get these are actually mad cheap. They sound like boutique phones that go for over $1k.Pros:1. Best sound available, really no competitor.2. Auto stop and start thing is pretty cool. It can get a tiny bit annoying if you're wearing glasses or whatever and the ear cup isn't totally lined up, but it's really easy to turn it off in the app.3. Battery life is freaking wild. Especially if you use the auto stop / start thing. I forget that I even need to charge these. It says 21 hours or whatever but I think that's 21 hours of use, because I charge mine maybe once a month or so.4. The noise cancellation is great. Bose is maybe a tad better with this specifically, but even with the cancellation off these are pretty isolating. Active noise cancellation isn't really the dopest thing in the world yet anyways. Both these and Bose are really only going to cut repetitive white noise and low-end frequencies. It's just how the tech works, so if you're looking for your cone of silence active noise cancelling phones are not going to be that thing. If you're looking for a little noise reduction tho these are where it's at. ANC will also effect the EQ of the music you're listening to, but I think B&W took extra time to make sure it wasn't too extreme with these. I noticed way more frequency loss (frequencies of the music that I actually wanted to hear haha) with the Bose ones.5. They actually do get better as B&W releases firmware updates. I thought that was some major BS when I first saw it haha but they seem to get more reliable every time they update them.6. They look awesome. B&W design has always been a step above, and these are right on par. I'm a professional musician and audio engineer, and every time someone comes through the studio and sees these I get compliments.Cons:1. They don't start off comfortable. Like they really don't. I almost took them back, but then I tried another pair of the Bose QC35s and was reminded that in terms of sound quality, the QC35s are probably 60% of these maximum. Anyways, the ear cups and headband on these are leather with some kind of padding in them that takes a bit to wear in, but that means they're gonna last forever once they do. I pretty much just wore a hat for a month or two when I wore these (to keep the headband off my head) and now they feel great. Just give them some time.2. You can't use these if they aren't charged. Even with the cable. But if I'm not mistaken that's because of they're active speakers so... that's just how active speakers work. Did I mention that they sound ridiculous? Like ridiculously good.3. The connection does occasionally get jumpy. For mine it seems to be when I turn my head all the way to the right and look way over my shoulder. Bose has issues like this too tho so I'm still all about these. It's more of a general bluetooth thing. Also just a note but this only happens when I'm walking around in the streets of NYC, so it might have something to do with interference.Anyways that's all the main stuff right there. I've seen a bunch of reviews from people being like 'one star cuz they aren't exactly like my other bowers and wilkins stuff' which is dumb and misinformed. Of course they aren't. You gotta do different stuff to make headphones noise-cancelling, including switching up cup materials and all that. These headphones are dank af and the only reason you'll regret buying them is if audio fidelity isn't worth the $400 to you. But if it's not idk why you would buy them in the first place u feel me?
This review is for the Bowers & Wilkins PX (Gold/Blue). This pair checks a lot of must-have boxes, from USB-C to AptX HD. The sound changes from muddy to crystal after a "burn in" period. Current revisions now come with a proper hard case. Average battery life. Average ANC. Comfort and sound are subjective. Great for people who appreciate complex music, wireless, with uncompressed audio.CONTENTS: Intro ‚îÇ What I Like ‚îÇ What I Don't Like ‚îÇ Package ‚îÇ Notes ‚îÇ Verdict- - - - -These headphones have been in my list for a long time. When it reached the low price threshold I have set, boom! unplanned purchase. What sets this apart is that this is the ONLY pair with USB-C, AptX HD, non-overpowered low frequency. This makes the codec really important, which the likes of Bose and Bang & Olufsen neglected with their current "flagship" ANC's. It also comes with multipoint connection (unlike the Sony's ), which is very useful for me. The auto-play/pause works for me 99% of the time, unlike other people (not sure why they have that problem). The USB-C also allows playback. I have no comment on build quality yet.WHAT I LIKE ‚îÇ + ‚îÇ+ Included hard case on current revisions.‚ÅΩ‚Åø‚Å∞‚Åæ+ Sound is perfectly balanced, as all things should be.‚ÅΩ‚Åø¬π‚Åæ+ USB C charging AND PLAYBACK.+ Aptx HD.

Checks a lot of boxes, but has shortcomings for the price.Questions? Hit the comments!This review is for the Bowers & Wilkins PX (Gold/Blue).
Here's a little background to how I arrived at these headphones: About 6 months ago I started a new job that had me commuting via train every morning. I had wired headphones that were constantly getting tangled and annoying me, so I decided to try my first pair of bluetooth headphones. At first, after some light research (and motivated by a Black Friday deal) I bought Sony XB950N1 Extra Bass Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones, Black and had two main issues with them:1. They were uncomfortable to wear on my head2. Massive sound leak, which was embarrassing on a train ride.So I returned those and started doing some research on a new pair that would solve those issues. I will stress that, overall, I liked the sound quality on those Sony headphones. The bass was overemphasized, but sound quality was not the issue. Fast forward past two months of research and I had narrowed down to two headphones that many people seem to be comparing: Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Case - Black and these Bowers & Wilkins PX. The general consensus seemed to be: the Sony's have a better app, are more comfortable, and better noise cancelling; while the Bowers & Wilkins have superior sound quality, are made of better quality materials, and 'look better'.For me, sound quality was my number one concern so I went with Bowers & Wilkins PX. Here's where irony sets in: I find them more comfortable than the Sony XB950N1 pair I had previously owned, and sound leakage was much less with the PXs...but the sound quality was awful. And I mean awful. How these keep receiving so much praise for their sound quality blows my mind because almost everything sounds flat. I'll break down a sampling of audio ranges/instruments and their sound quality on these headphones:Bass (tested with Lil Wayne's "A Milli" and Taylor Swift's "Are you Ready for it?"): average, nothing special. It pops a bit, but on songs with a heavy bass the bass is underrepresented.Female vocals (tested with Feist's "1234" and She&Him's "You really got a hold on me"): slightly above average. The higher the vocal range, the better these pick them up.Male vocals (tested with Mumford & Sons "Sigh no more" and TV on the Radio's "A Method"): below average and flat. Blends into the background with most other instruments.Acoustic guitar (tested with Bon Iver's "skinny love", Jack Johnson's "Gone" and Weezer's "The world has turned and left me here"): pathetically flat. Imagine listening with a cloth between you and the earphone, that's how dull and flat they sound.Synthesizer (tested with Michelle Branch's "Fault line" and Van Halen's "Jump"): slightly above average pop from this instrument.Piano (Tested on Maxence Cyrin's cover of "where is my mind?" and Van Halen's "Right now"): flat flat flat.Drums (tested on tested on numerous songs): surprisingly strong. This is the one instrument that really seems to shine on these headphones.So if audio quality was the primary reason for buying these, and that was mostly below average and rarely even average, what else really matters? I'll briefly touch on a few other aspects of these headphones.Volume: Below average! They did not get loud enough for me when not in a quiet room. Even when maxed out I felt like I wanted to go at least one, maybe two notches higher.Noise cancelling: So these actually do a decent job of cancelling out noise without any noise cancelling enabled simply because of how well they wrap onto your head. I was pleased with this, but when I entered into an environment where I wanted some noise cancelling I had to deal with lower audio quality. The audio quality was already bad enough on these, and it just got worse when NC was enabled.The app: good lord it's awful. I mean straight trash. The fact that it doesn't come with many options, like no equalizer and no volume control on the app itself, was disappointing. But what really annoyed me about it was how easily the app itself (NOT the bluetooth connection) disconnected from the headphones. Each time I would open the app it would take about 30 seconds to sync with the headphones, and if I switched over to another app, or just back to the homescreen, the app LOSES CONNECTION with the headphones (once again, not the bluetooth connection, just the app's sync with the headphones)! So each time you switch back to the app you have to wait 30 seconds for it to re-sync with your headphones. Ridiculous!Build quality: they're great in terms of material, except the 'on' switch is a pain because you have to slide it really hard to turn it on. As for the complaints about the carrying case...it's nice, but it is pure cloth. I don't really buy headphones for a quality carrying case but at $400 I expect better. This case will do little to prevent any serious damage from being done.I will make minor mention of one redeeming quality: they sound much, much better when connected through a wire to your device. It's like night and day, to the point that I almost wonder if there's something defective about the pair I got. I understand that audio quality is always better wired than wireless but that doesn't explain why the Sony's I got, which were ~$140, sounded much better than these when in wireless mode. It also doesn't explain all the praise I've seen these get for how good they supposedly sound when wireless.Awful, awful product for $400. At the level of audio quality, app quality, volume capacity, and difficulty with the physical 'on/off' buttons that I received from these I would not pay more than $100. They sound that bad. The app is that bad. I could not possibly recommend these headphones to anyone at this price point.
[Unbiased Review] The Bowers & Wilkins PX headphones (new revised version) are awesome, especially after 60 hours of burn in listening, where the sound quality improves. The soundstage is wide, bass isn‚Äôt that good during first use as it cracks at high volumes, but overtime becomes much clearer, mid-tones and highs are perfect, instrumentals are clear and crisp, very distinguishable. Noise cancelling technology attempted for the first time by Bowers&Wilkins isn‚Äôt as good as Bose, but somewhat almost comparable to Beats, not the best. But good enough, it blocks out most sounds on the lower pitch spectrum, as high pitch voices can still be heard a bit. Been a Bowers&Wilkins fan for years, thanks to their perfect acoustic sound reproduction and sleek, elegant design  I really love.Now, rating this headphone is subjective as we all have different preferences, but here‚Äôs a summary:‚Ä¢ Sound Quality - 9.5/10 (after 60 hours of burn in)Treble and Vocals are excellent, Bass doesn‚Äôt sound great out the box and takes listening time to improve. Great for listening acoustics, country, instrumentals, jazz and pop, but not much for R&B and rock, or heavy metal. No wonder, Volvo, McLaren and some BMW trusts them for their car audio.‚Ä¢ Build Quality - 9/10 great materials used, quality parts, leather is genuine, softens over time and absolutely feels good. New version, comes with a nice hard case with zipper and garter for your charger and audio cable. ALTHOUGH, there‚Äôs a potential WEAK POINT near the ear cup where you see breakages from other users. Metal fatigue, can happen over time as pressure is applied there during wear and use, which can break some point in the future. The buttons on the headphones and tactile feedback feels good and plush.‚Ä¢ Battery Life - 10/10 great battery! Although the app says it maxes out at 97~98%, it may be an isolated app issue. (I also have a P5 Wireless which I bought in 2016, and still good up to this date. So this should be much better)‚Ä¢ Comfort - 9/10 my head is quite big, and headphones have a great seal, so it‚Äôs comfortable to wear, ANC works well and the genuine leather which softens up after prolonged use feels great. Discomfort may happen after prolonged use for some users, with smaller heads. I fell asleep in bed wearing this and no discomfort so far, leather gets softer so it only gets better.‚Ä¢ Customer Service (USA) - Good, not great as calling them is the best way to reach them. Their tech support is amazing though 9/10. Calling them is a bit of a wait around 6-10 minutes long and is not 24/7.Overall, for $400 USD (before taxes) the Bowers&Wilkins PX headphone are amazing over-the-ear headphones with a final score of 9.5/10 especially when you‚Äôre like me who mostly listens to (Pop, Acoustics, Country, Jazz and Instrumentals)  noise cancelling is good enough for most users, not as great as BOSE, but it gets the job done in most scenarios. The B&W mobile app, Connects to the headphones fine, enough features you need. (Note: If you‚Äôre encountering issues with the app not connecting to your headphones, it may be a Bluetooth conflict or interference issue, with another device connected to your phone. Tech support doesn‚Äôt know this, but figured it out myself)Device:  Apple iPhone XS MAX iOS 13.3

Best headphones ive ever owned. And i have bought and reviewed quite a few.My previous favorite headphones were the sony mdr-1am2 which were lighter and more portable than these mdr-z7m2 but the sound signsture is better on the z7m2. The z7m2 are WAY more comfortable but heavier, however they have good solid clamp over your ears so they stay in place and the cushions so soft, you forget you are wearing them.  The 1am2s can work well with cell phones and are loud (16ohm) but these z7m2 are quiet on cell phones due to needing more power to drive them (56ohms).Both headphones are considered closed back. The z7m2 leaks more aound than the 1am2s, but significantly less than an open back headphone like the hifiman sundara whoch is an open back headphone.Sony shoots for a neutral response. Meaning bass is flat, mids are flat, and treble is flat. A speaker will perform a certain way based on the housing its in. So far, these z7m2 are my absolute favorite and with a 70mm speaker/driver, its one of the biggest on the market. The highs are crystal clear, the bass can thump, and the mids are nice and warm. On the comparison side, the hifiman sundara are extremely bright (8khz is blown up by like 8db) and lack bass. However both headphones you can add bass with an EQ if you are in the mood to shake/vibrate your head. In fact, all 3 headphones I have mentioned can handle extra bass if you were so inclined. Some brands of headphones lack bass and you cannot eq more as the speaker itself will make mechanical noise, headphones like sennheisers in the same price group, audio-technica, and other cheap off brands. They just have no bass to begin with and you cant eq more. The Sonys are just, eargasm to me.There are multiple kinds of headphone users. "Audiophiles" who are snobs and honestly HATE neutral reaponse. These people prefer smooth mids and ultra bright ear shattering highs while completely lacking bass. Reminds me of old people shaking a cane saying "turn the darn bass down." If you were to look at a graph, the bass has serious roll off (negative, below center) while mids are flat and highs slightly above neutral flat. Like most sennheisers, audio-technica, hifiman, etc.Then you have those who want purity. Also a bit snobby (i can admit im a neutral snob) I want headphones to give me accurate representations of the music, how the person who created it wanted us to hear.... Which means flat bass (not lacking but not too much) flat mids and most importantly flat highs. If you were to look at a graph of frequency and reaponse the line will be as flat as possible. Sennheiser hd800s break the mold and end up in this catagory, but also are extremely expensive. Also Sony's lineup so far (1am2, z7m2). I want to get my hands on the z1r, but thats a long time from now if ever.V shaped people. They want heavy bass, flat mids, and harsh highs. The heavy bass requires harsh highs in order to overcome single speaker issues. A speaker playing heavy bass cannot produce accurate highs. It just can't. Thus the V shape. Not many headphones are V shape. Sony have xtrabass headphones and while the bass on a graph would be above the neutral flat line, the highs roll off and are lacking. Some of the more expensive xtrabass could fit the V shape ideal. Bass heads love these headphones. Similar to beats headphones by dr.dre....Then the mid lovers. No bass, no highs, but amazing mids. Aka the vocalist. Very rare, generally these people dont like music as a whole, and prefer heavy vocal music where the voice is the key feature. Also those who like podcasts. I dont have any examples of this because I dont have any that fit the bill in my headphone arsenal.So which are you?
They look and feel very well built, and are quite light for size.The soundstage is very good for closed headphones.The bass packs a punch, it's fast and dynamic. The mids feel a bit lagged compared to the other frequencies and perhaps because of the excess of bass is that I feel that they lack a bit of clarity.I would like to hear a little more information on the treble, don't get me wrong, the sound in general is very good, especially for long time listening, they have a relaxed sound that will allow you to listen to them for hours and in a very dynamic way that you will undoubtedly enjoy.But if you are looking for excessive detail in your music with a lot of information, these are not the right headphones for you.That said, they are my favorite headphones for listening to Trance and House music.
I have the original MDRz7 and these are a good upgrade. They managed to make the sound more transparent in the mids and highs compared to the last version. I had the top of the line Z1's but I returned them because they were hard on my ears. I also returned the Focal clears and Mr Speakers Ether C. I currently own Hifiman HE6SE which I drive off my SET tube amps and the Edition xx which I use with my Aurender Flow dac but lately I've been using the Sony MDRz7 mark 1 because I like the stronger bass even though the highs were slightly veiled compared to both my Hifiman phones I own, so I tried these MDRz7-M2 and they really improved the upper frequencies now comparable the Edition XX phones but with much more Bass that was too excessive and loose making the phones vibrate annoyingly on my ears. I discovered that this was caused by the new pads which I don't like so I swapped them out with the Z7 mark 1 pads and the bass is much tighter and better and I am happy now. I also own the Audeze LCD-XC and they are good however they cant be played as loud as the Sony nor is the sound-stage as wide. the Audeze cost $1200 and are heavy so the Sony's are a bargain especially when you swap out the pads, which I recommend doing. I enjoy the Sony's the most out of all my headphones.
Good sound that is characteristic of Sony's style, easy to drive (phone, laptop, etc) and very very comfortable overall.  My two main issues were:1)  They leak a lot of sound for being closed backs.  Not a huge deal... but definitely something to think about.2)  The deal breaker for me was there not being a reliable way to replace the pads.  On the Z7 mark 1's and the Z1R's, you can just twist off the pads and replace them. On the 1A series you can just pop off the ring.  But on the Z7M2's...?? I dunno.They definitely don't twist off despite that being how it's done for the Z7 and Z1R... the rings dont seem to pop-off either. I double checked the b instruction manual.... nothing.  It does list the pads as a part, but no info on how to change them.  Ok, so I tried looking around on YouTube and audio forums for a tutorial..... no luck.Next I contacted Sony about how to replace the ear pads.  They told me to contact their servicer, United Radio.  I contacted United Radio and they said the b pads aren't serviceable, and they would have to swap them out for a whole new unit if under warranty.......  What??At this price point, the pads need to be user serviceable, just like they are on the Z7 and the Z1R.  I have no clue why Sony decided to change that for the Z7M2 when it's based on those two models.
I was in need of closed back headphones and although I had tried the Focal Stella's and loved them $3000 was not in my budget.I have owned plenty of sony Headphones and build quality was always an issue but these are built wonderfully.The sound seems to get better the longer I use them .With the 70mm drivers I thought the bass might be bloated or slow and that was not the case .Easily my favorite Headphones and definitely worth the price except now I rarely pick up my Sennheisers or Grados .The pads are replaceable you just have to remove a screw then twist
These headphones have a built in DAC and I‚Äôm able to get full hi res music (24bit/192kHZ) from my iPad Pro‚Äôs downloaded Amazon HD music. You will need a wire to connect the headphones to your iPad Pro. With Bluetooth only (no wire) you will get slightly better (24bit/48kHZ) than cd quality sound.
Such a solid build.. very comfortable. Sound is nice.. doesn‚Äôt blow my socks off.. first thing you will notice is soundstage.. however the more power you throw at it the better it sounds. You need at least a solid watt
These headphones were a great investment for my studio work and personal listening. They are 3X what I have paid for headphones previously, but worth every penny.
Cable too long! Good sound though over-priced.
Nice but too much bass for me

These are awesome headphone; the best I‚Äôve ever owned or heard. The sound quality is wonderful over the full 3hz to 100,000hz spectrum. They are super lightweight and comfortable. Highly recommended!! üëç
I'll be comparing these to my experiences with mid-level Sennheiser headphones, which I replaced with the Sony this time because Sennheiser is bad about not supporting their products (which I have grown tired of). I did not get these for noise-cancellation, so I will not be reviewing based on that (however, they do mask background noise better than my 598s, including the sound of my Cherry MX Brown mechanical keyboard and my CPU fans, if that is a factor for you).Pros:- The bass response is exceptional. That's not necessarily a good thing for ear health, but if bass is important to you, the MDR1AM2s bring it.- The packaging is impressive, right down to the custom-fitted shrink wrap, but I had to damage the outer sleeve on the box to get it open, so it might make returns problematic.- The cans swivel flat, making them relatively easy to store and to pack in a laptop bag. They would make excellent headphones for a traveler.- They are lightweight. I'm not sure how that will bode for long-term durability. I'll have to get back to you in 5 years.Cons:- The over-the-ear design is too tight for my liking.  With my Sennheisers (598 SE), I could forget I was wearing them. I can't with the MDR1AM2s. I find myself frequently adjusting the left can for proper fit. Nipponjin must have small ears compared to Germans.- The leather-style earpads make my ears sweat.- Although I expect the frequency response to improve once the drivers break-in, out of the box, the high frequency response is lackluster at best. By comparison with the Sn 598s, they sound more hollow. Note: I do expect this to improve over time, but as to how much it will improve, that has yet to be heard.- The included headphone jack does not fit correctly with my standard extension cable. I had to nudge the plug out just a bit to get the sound to come through correctly. I'm not sure at this point whether replacing the cable with a different one will alleviate that issue. So far, it hasn't been a major problem.- Any movement of the cable will carry through to the cans, interfering with the sound quality. So if you are working at your computer and have to move your head, even a centimeter, you will hear it.Conclusions:- They're good, but I liked my $94.00 (on sale at the time) Sennheiser 598 SEs better (until the OEM earpads wore out and I couldn't get a comparable replacement because Sennheiser product support leaves something to be desired).
Had an old pair of Sony MDR-10R headphones for the last decade or so. I loved them, they still work and produce great sound. However, the cushions had long since worn out so I figured it was okay to replace your headphones once every 10 years or so, was just scared of getting something worse than what I was used to. Read the stats on this model and it had good reviews, so I said I'll chance it.HOLY COW these headphones put those old MDR-10R's to shame! Quite literally the best sounding headphones I have ever had, to include the 2 previous Sonys. I cannot believe how much better they sound. These have an oval, snug fit around the ears which I prefer, my son didn't like the fit as he is used to the completely round fit of his headphones. Quite honestly the fit is the only point I can imagine someone complaining because the sound is just phenomenal
I just might by a second pair. Seriously, they are that good....  I have been on a spree of buying headphone for awhile now trying to find a pair that aren't lacking. Proper bass response without destroying the mids and highs.... and then still having said mids and highs.... these fit the bill! I am blown away at the sound quality. For the money, they compare to headphones that cost twice as much. I had a pair of HifiMan Sundara's which are about the same price (50 bucks more) and these make the Hifiman headphones seem like a cheap gimmick.... The sound stage exists and yet they are closed back... but when you have media that is spacious (some songs, games, movies) you can feel the size. Its not AS LARGE of a sound space as open back headphones, but its not as tight and "close" as closed back usually are. These are seriously my favorite pair of headphones, ever.... Don't get me wrong, if I had the money, I would buy the Sennheiser HD800s Reference.... but those are like 1800 bucks.... these are a paltry 300 bucks and sound in my opinion almost as good, but not quite. As I said I have been all over the place headphone wise, beyerdynamics, other sony's, hifiman, audiotechnica, and these particular sonys put them all to shame....I have the sound blaster AE-9 with upgraded OP-AMPS (which will soon yet again get updated this time with MUSES instead of burr browns), which I then use the RCA output into my headphone amplifier.... I have used both the sound cards headphone amplifier and my own via RCA, and I prefer the RCA, its more pure, better low end, better mids, and better highs.... I use the Schiit Magni Heresy, yeah the one that is driven by op-amps! The combo is insane. I can't wait to hear what MUSES do to the sound quality from top to bottom....I want a second pair of these, so I can leave one at my desk, and have the other for bed. I'm too lazy to simply walk them from A to B over and over again. but they are so good in quality, its kinda worth having another pair....
cant beat this for hi-res music
Let's start with what I can say for sure: the are the best sounding and most comfortable headphones I've ever used, full stop. If you want the best possible sound quality and the most comfort these are the top of the heap. I'm using these with an Xperia 10 and FLAC music, HiRes end to end, and these headphones do the high quality audio justice. I've been a music fan all my life and have lived through record, tape, CD, compressed audio, etc and nothing has ever sounded as good as these with HiRes music. These headphones are also extremely comfortable. The pads are a super soft fake leather that is as soft as skin or a flower petal or velvet, it is extremely soft. The head piece is also coated in soft fabric. And the headphones are so light that it is shocking when you first hold them. You can listen to these for hours without fatigue.Now, let's get to what only time can clarify: I don't know how durable these are. As I mentioned they are so light that it is shocking, but that lightness makes them feel cheap. On closer inspection they are made with high quality materials. What feels in places like an all 0lastic body is in fact metal in many places. The metal is simply so thin and light it feels lime plastic. That said coming from a pair of Master & Dynamics these feel very light and brittle. Only time will tell. At first I thought they were cheaply made but like I said over time I've realized that they are actually very well made, just with an emphasis on lightness. That said, I know I'll have those master and dynamics in 10 or even 20 years. How these will fare we can only wait and see.Ultimately I recommend these highly. My priorities are comfort and sound quality and these do the trick. These don't have features that reduce quality like Bluetooth or noise cancelation so what you are paying for here is premium audio quality, not xoensive extras that make your music sound worse. These paired with HiRes music and a player are as good as it gets and the first true improvement I've heard in audio quality I've heard in my adult life.
Incredible headphones. Probably my favorite closed back Headphones ever under $300. Better than the original MDR1A's, better than the ath-msr7, ath-m40x & m50x, ws1100is, Beyerdynamic dt770, akg k361 & k371, Samson z55, status Audio cb-1, Takstar pro 82, JVC harx700 & harx900 and countless others I've owned and heard. Better than all. Comfort is amazing and their super light. The only con I can think of is their build quality. I wish they had slightly more metal in their construction but then again they wouldn't be as light. If you take care of your gear though these will last for a very long time. These are super stylish and sexy looking on top of their cloud like comfort. They come with a nice travel pouch although would have been appreciated if they came with a hard case instead. I purchased one seperately. For sound as I said they are the best I've heard under $300 and trust me when I say I've heard easily close to 100 if not more different models under $300. Bass is extremely detailed and impactful. Could be slightly faster and decay quicker but none the less it truly is incredible. It doesn't bleed into the mid-range like the original MDR1A's did. The mid-range is slightly recessed in the upper mid-range but the lower part is thick, lush and full. Very good. The upper mid-range as I said Is slightly recessed but still maintains nice detail and natural timber to it that is engaging and enchanting. Never harsh or sibilant. The treble brings nice sparkle the originals lacked severely. Great detail and a sense of air while maintaining some of the smoothest response you could ask for. It's extremely nice. Soundstage is not very wide or deep at all but brings a rather intimate presentation to it instead. Imaging is quite accurate but not the best In the price range I will say that but still very good. All in all these are the best in my opinion and you should have bought them yesterday.
After using these headphone for about 40 hours, they have become one of my favorites to use with the balanced cable attached to my Astell & Kahn Alpha player streaming Tidal service. Very strong bass. Nice size soundstage. I have come to appreciate some albums even more just by the high quality sound these headphone produce. Personally, as good as the heavy Audeze LCD-XC, plus you can wear them for hours unlike the Audeze headphones. Worth the price. Nice to add to my small collection of headphones which well with the above player as well the Naim Untii-Star system. You will enjoy these headphones. I did find they sound much better using the Balance connection than the standard 3.5 mm.
I bought this head set after having lost my well used MDR7506. Seemed like a good upgrade, but I was quickly disappointed.I really liked the idea that the headset cable could be replaced if it was damaged. 3.5mm cables are cheap and so replacing a cable over a whole headset is ideal. While it never happened on my old 7506, it was a constant worry in my mind. Sony, however had a different idea. While the cable plug into the headset IS 3.5 mm... the back shell of the 3.5 mm is custom designed so that only SONY's 3.5 mm plugs will work. My 3.5 mm cable replacement went from $2 to $40.The jack on the headset to receive the 3.5 mm cable frequently hit my shoulder as I naturally looked around my work space. Not usually knocking off the headset, but for something that should help me work, I found the constant nudges distracting.While the sound quality seemed good and the headphone pads were comfortable, the headset jack and cable plug situation turned me off to paying $300 for the headset and I decided to return it. I have found the pair of the now discontinued 7506 and am very happy to have save $200 by buying the older (yet superior) headset.
Wow, that's all I will say.... ok well I will say a little about these. They are very light, so they can feel a bit cheap in hand. But they are constructed very well whith just all plastic parts but look very amazing and feel well made. Sound is simply stunning,  I have never listened to music that sounded that clear and balkanced. These do have low deep bass but does not overpower any of the other sounds like it can be hitting a very low sound and yet you can still hear the slightest highs crystal clear.  They are truly amazing,  and since they are so light they are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Ok so I will wrap this up with a ps4 note.... I have very high end 300 dollar gaming headphones that I tested side by side hooked up just to the ps4 controller, playing Call of Duty. And let's just say it went from playing a war game on the TV to being in the game in the TV. Completely blew my gaming headphones out of the water I am selling them know, no need fir them anymore I will use these for my gaming now and music. You will ve shocked at how fast these respond to explosions and bullets being fired it hits hard and deep punch bass but yet you will hear every shell cassing hit the floor! Sell your expensive gaming headphones and do yourself a huge upgrade to your gaming experience and buy these!!!

Was a gift for Xmas to my husband‚Ä¶Will be open this Xmas so can‚Äôt tell you anything about it‚Ä¶
sound ok-  they look great, but a little bulky for me
Previouly, I had been purchasing inexpensive headphones. This time I was able to buy Cleer Audio Endura.A very great decision. 5.0 makes the ease of pairing, the sound is outstanding.
I use this for both my PC and phone, so I have it on for a large part of every day (even if nothing is playing). It can be left on for WEEKS without needing to be recharged, even though I listen to music and play games often across both devices.The one thing to look out for is that when connected to a PC, there are TWO audio sources listed. One is the normal high quality sound while the other sounds very low quality. I'm guessing this is a lower latency mode? Either way if the sound is coming out bad, check which audio source you're playing to.Looks great and is very compact. It is fully over-ear and is comfortable for long periods of time.
Great thing about buying headphones that coat hundreds from a few years ago is the sound is crisp and clear, while the cost is lower so they can sell their newer ones at a similar price to the original price of this product. I played it for hrs yesterday when I got it. Feel sleep with them on, just checked still says 100% battery. If it dose not hold up to the 100(ish) hrs & it's just a ploy to make you think it has great battery life then I will come back and edit. Otherwise why buy brand new headphones at ridiculous prices when you can have almost the same quality as headphones made this year for so much less. (Willing to give it some wiggle room on the batter since it was sitting in the box fully charged for 4 years. Although even if it only has 80hrs of playtime then that is still several times better than most anything else at this current price point.If the price goes back up to $200 then my rating should be 3 stars simply because I would recommend newly made headphones for that price.
They were not kidding about the Battery life. I use this to stay on call/watch youtube/netflix pretty much 4-8 hours /day. It needs charging once every 15 days. So, on the battery life, I am thoroughly impressed. I have tested with MAC, Windows and Android phone. It works on three just fine.The improvement would be in terms of range. The range is no more than 3-5m. I have had headphones that used to work at easily double this distance. I am willing to take a 10-20% hit on the battery life if the range can be improved via a software/firmware update
Well, my mac had an incredibly hard time finding the bluetooth connection (and never did; and yes I know how to work bluetooth), and I don't have time to sit around and wait for it. I therefore plugged it directly into the mac. Oh well for the bluetooth. Sound was only okay; i'm using this for listening to remote meetings, not for gaming or music. Was comfortable enough unless you wear glasses--and i do--and in that case, these grind your earpieces (formally called "temple tips") into the sides of your head. Maybe all such headphones do.These might be fine for some people; I did not find them superior over my boring old Apple earbuds. For me, not worth the money. Depending on your use, you might give 'em a try. They did not bring anything extraordinary to the table for my purposes.You're probably thinking I should try ear buds. Got 'em. They fall out of my ears and disconnect the bluetooth when they do so, and it takes an unacceptably long time to reconnect. Especially embarrassing when you're conducting a business meeting.One final thing: the packaging! Getting into this product was like breaking into Fort Knox. Lots of layers and fancy stuff, if you're into that. I am not. I don't know... they're pretty and all. Maybe for gaming or music... I just recommend that you make sure you can return 'em.Three stars because I recognize these might be fine for somebody, or some other purpose; they just weren't for me. Good luck with the bluetooth.
I'd say I have a pretty average sized head and these barely fit me. They feel like they're made for teens or children. They look and feel nice just wish they fit better.
Headphones were working until they wouldn't charge anymore. Not sure what happened. They sit on my desk or on my head, so I don't think it was anything environmental. Although, there was something weird that they would do when plugging into my PC. It would open a drive. I thought this was unusual, but figured it was apart of the hardware. It's a bummer, but what can ya do. :*(
After wanting to find a pair of headphones to keep in the office, I thought I had finally found what I was looking for.Bluetooth 5.0, USB-C charging, long battery life, and a pedigree of ex-Sony and other audio company employees reeled me in.  Their ironless driver tech sounded interesting.Unfortunately, it just doesn't meet the quality standard I'm looking for.  They are perfectly serviceable, but they have issues that make them just not for me.Pros:1. Nice material.  They feel well made and look nice.  Padding felt decent.2. I never tested battery life, but I'd take their word it's long.3. Sound accuracy felt acceptable.  Nothing tinny in the treble and bass was not boomy.Cons:1. Fit was okay, but not great. Earcups didn't feel very deep and was noticably shallow with my ears touching the inner material easily.Also the top of the headband did not feel thick enough and with less than an hour I easily felt it would not be something I think I could tolerate for long sessions.2. Sound stage.  While it felt reasonably accurate, it was pretty closed off.  Treble and bass were okay, but it felt very narrow in my head.This is very common with closed back headphones, but this pair felt isolating in the same way any budget set would and I was hoping for better given the pedigree mentioned earlier.All in all, this didn't turn out to be the unicorn I was hoping for.  I'll couch this with the fact that my home pair is an Audeze Mobius.  While these are half the price, I'm not sure I can say these are any better than half the quality either.Perfectly decent headphones, but I can't be certain that for $180 you're getting any better than the $100 or sub $100 pairs out there.

Wow, just wow. TLDR right up front, these are fantastic headphones for the price. If you have any hesitation to buy them whatsoever, let me tell you that you won't be disappointed. Bass is a bit lower than some people would like, but hey they're open backs!My pair arrived in their retail box, which was kind of surprising as the box wasn't even sealed. Thankfully the headphones were undamaged and they appear to be brand new, although I honestly wouldn't care if they were used since they look fine.Included I was surprised to find a 1/4 inch (the big audio connector for amps and such) to 3.5mm adapter pre-installed on the unit. I was actually kind of worried that I accidentally purchased the wrong variant of these headphones, since the adapter looked like it was part of the cable. Thankfully my initial assumption was incorrect, and the adapter unscrewed revealing a 3.5 mm plug, although I must say the quality of this adapter is what fooled me. It's super nice and fits on the cable seamlessly!The fabric the removable ear pads are made out of is kind of strange, it's almost like a felt material but it doesn't have the same shininess to it. Nevertheless it is very comfortable for the price, and in general comfort of these headphones is quite good. The self-adjusting headband and whatnot is a straight-up clone of the AKG K240s, which certainly isn't a bad thing in this case. Samson have done a fantastic job replicating the design of the K240s while also managing to keep costs low. The non-removable cable is a bit of a downside, but the included cable is very high quality and quite long. Seriously I've never seen gold-plated connectors that look and feel this good. As an Australian drummer once said "they're are symphony of plastic, but AvE has taught me that not all plastics are created equal". That statement is definitely true here, as the plastic that Samson has used for the SR850s is definitely on the higher quality side. The headband is fake leather and the supports that house the audio cable for the other driver are made of metal (maybe aluminum?).Now, onto sound quality. Honestly when I had seen and heard all of the great reviews on these headphones I was expecting them to be quite amazing. Maybe it's not as dramatic as I expected, but these are my first pair of legitimately good budget headphones. The "sound stage" or 3D feel of the sound is definitely there, and while playing video games with gunfire or engines you can definitely feel the openness of the semi open back design. I particularly enjoy running around in Skyrim SE with them.I will say the bass isn't crazy heavy, but looking at the frequency response graph for these headphones they're actually somewhat more bassy than more of the higher end true open back headphones. This is fine for me though, I do like base but I understand the concessions that had to be made for these headphones to have such good soundstage. That's always been the trade-off for open backs, less bass and also way less noise isolation. And on that note, yeah they definitely don't block anywhere near as much noise as a set of earmuffs would, but I actually like that since I need to be able to hear things while I'm using my computer or listening to music on my iPod. As always with audio, it's very subjective and you may find that these are the best headphones ever for you, or you may hate them because they're not crazy bassy like most everything else made nowadays. (Looking at you Beats and Raycons!) I can't really find any other descriptive words to describe the mids or highs, because I'm really just a novice when it comes to audio. Maybe just... they're great!As far as durability goes I've only had them for a few days so I can't say much as to how I think they'll stand up over the long term. I will say that the non-removable cable is definitely once again a downside as far as durability goes, but if you're really invested in keeping your SR850s alive and you're handy with a soldering iron I see no reason why you couldn't add an aux connector connector. The headband and metal supports seem quite sturdy given the price, and I expect these to last for years to come. By then I'll likely have something better, but honestly if you're just into them for the looks, for content creators or streamers they look really cool and professional. I think if these things ever have some sort of catastrophic failure I'll either buy a new pair or attempt to fix these myself, as the design seems fairly simple.The ear cups are removable and seem to be fairly modular. I'm sure there are several replacements on various websites, and if you're handy with sewing scissors and a needle and thread you could probably even make your own if you were so inclined. I think some gel ear pads would be super cool to try with these, although I don't know if these headphones have enough of a cult following for some manufacturer to take on that challenge.Maybe if I'm feeling brave enough one day I will take apart the ear cup and speaker assembly to see how repairable they are from the inside, but for now I'm just happy to have a very good sounding set of headphones for my PC and iPod.9/10, definitely five stars but a non-removable cable is probably the only downside. You'll know these aren't crazy bassy if you're in the market for open backs so that's not a downside in my opinion.
Not really sure how I can go into an in-depth review of headphones, but I am not sure anything I can say, can do these Samson's justice.  I will just do a quick (after a few days) "first impressions" review for these.Pros:  - Sound Quality: These headphones SOUND AMAZING ... granted I have never had higher end headphones myself but I am a fan of "clean" sound ... not overly basey (though that can be fun at times) or too much treble, that can sound "tinny" that way.  These sound perfect, and I love the mids in these (I am OVERsimplifying this but say most of the instruments and vocals of a typical rock song), versus some of my bluetooth headphones where sometimes it sounds muddy or the vocalist (example) is in another room vs the rest of the band playing the music.  I have randomly gone through my collection and listened to Jazz, Rap, Rock, and more ... and these sound great across the board.  Some headphones tuned for base ... they can sound ok but with some genres like Smooth Jazz ... it doesn't sound right having an emphasis on base.  These just sound so clear, with maybe one issue for some people (depending on personal taste and genre ... It's my first "con" listed below, and it's the base ...mainly for those people that love alot of extra base... i have to make that part CLEAR).  I know some of my cheaper headphones people may laugh at ... say the Sony ZX100's or ZX110's may not have as great of a sound of these Samson's but one thing I love about the Samson's is that they dont "ruin" the other headphones I have ... like "these are so so great that anything else sounds bad now" ... these sound better but i am still happy with some of those other headphones too. I was sort of afraid that may happen, but glad it didn't.  - The earpad/overall comfort: I cant say any headphones I have had are UNcomfortable, mind you, but these which are not the ones with the "Pleather" (like fake leather) earpads that I see some SR850 reviews posting that they came with.  The SR850s that I got, have velour earpads that may not be as good as the Bravewavs ones I see people replace these with but ... I was expecting these to be "harder" and less comfortable then they are ...  I may check out those BrainWavs pads, and maybe even buy a pair to have "on hand", but these default pads do NOT need to be changed ... they are great the way they are.Cons:  - Sound (base ... if you are a "base-head"): just have to mention that if you are a "base head" needing extra base ... well these are not for you ... I'd RECOMMEND trying these to listen to your music as an extra pair ... but something like the SkullCandy Cruzher like series or The SoundCore series may be more of what you want. These are a good option if you have a more base heavy pair of headphones and you want to hear what all the bragging about these headphones are all about ... maybe for like rap you use those other headphones for jazz or soul music you use these ... in other wards "give these a try ... " sort of thing ... the BASE IS "there" but just not like some of my say Bluetooth headphones ... the base is done in a "classy" way .. a "clean" way, in my view.  I also know the GREAT sound in these can be thrown off if there was more base ... it can be a delicate balance and ... the base may be EXACTLY WHERE it should be to not mess up the rest of the balance of these headphones.  - this I will put here ... but it's not so much a con as a "gee i wish they did this" sort of thing ... I wish the REALLY GOOD cable ... was removable/replaceable ... but then again if it's really that good, you will not need to replace it. The cable doesn't look or feel cheap in anyway, and I dont want people to get what I am saying confused ... I just "wish" that this cable was removable.  If something happens to it .. not counting people that may be able to solder something back on ... you would need to get another pair (which ... if my cable broke ... I 100% would get another pair of these SR850's .. they are worth it).  -Appearance: I almost forgot this in the review.  I have seen a few videos on these headphones and i have seen thumbnails ... they always looked ok, but I was more interested in the sound ... I can't comment about how they look on my head, but just having them in my possession ... they really look pretty good .. not my favorite looking headphones mind-you but ... they look better than I was picturing when I ordered them.  Bottom Line:  I dont think I have to say much here, as I obviously 100% recommend these, even to base-heads just as a "try these and listen to your favorite music, and hear the difference" sort of thing. I hear some people who do music professionally getting blown away with the sound and the price of these, together ... some say that reference headphones wise these have more base then others (say comparable AKG's)... but if you want that quality/type of sound .. with a pitch/bit of more base .. THESE ARE the ones to go with.  "if your just listening to your music and you want SUPER GOOD quality, but aren't doing studio audio type stuff you need a true pair of reference headphones... these are the ones to get" .
So first things first‚Äîfor the price these headphones are exceptional.For under 50 dollars you‚Äôre getting a beautifully balanced sound with a decent top end and a punchy bass. I reckon these sound like 150-200 dollar headphones.Now the obvious caveat is that these feel quite cheap. The plastic feels flimsy and weak for all intents and purposes. However, the sound completely and totally compensates for the build quality. Additionally, they‚Äôre quite comfortable despite the relatively cheap build quality.These are open backs so the noice canceling really boils down to how loud you play your music. If you have the volume at 75% I can still hear things around me, but it‚Äôs mostly drowned out.  If you‚Äôre familiar with open backs, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs not particularly surprising, but it‚Äôs certainly noteworthy if you don‚Äôt already know that.These headphones are also incredibly versatile. They have pretty amazing sound staging for the price. When listening to jazz standards and that kind of thing they sound amazing. The bass is also quite punchy and defined allowing vocals in rap to shine through.Overall I have zero complaints and would definitely recommend.10/10
Absolutely incredible headphone for the price. My pair lasted me a very very long time especially considering all the abuse I put them through. I was really rough on these things, I dropped them all the time, and I threw them when I got angry and stuff like that. The right ear driver went out after probably 100 or so drops on the ground. These were very hard drops on the ground too, and even then only the right driver went out, every other part of the headphone remained unharmed. The sound quality on these are incredible, especially for the price. These were my first open back headphones and they were a great introduction. These feel weird on your head at first due to the padding but when you get used to it they have a very good comfort level. With the recent price cut they got, I can 100% recommend these to anyone. They sound incredible, are extremely durable, they run out of anything, are comfortable when you get used to them, and are 100% the best headphone you can buy in its price range, even when it was $50.
Honestly, these sound better than my sony xm4's (even used an equalizer), and the sound quality to price ratio is absurd. I've had many headphones in the past, most more expensive than these that don't even compare in sound quality, I wish I had gotten these sooner. I have a larger head than average, and these just barely fit, I can still feel a bit of pressure from the headband but otherwise its fine.
The sound is amazing for the price, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but the cable broke after a few months of light use. One of the parts of the stress reliever on the top of the cable broke and just recently I noticed the cable itself broke in the same place revealing the wires on the inside. This has caused some problems like sound only coming out of one ear. The 3.5mm to 1/4 in adapter is also defective in my case, it only plays sound through one ear. How do I know this isn‚Äôt just the fault of the faulty cable? It also does this to my Beyerdynamic DT770 and my apple EarPods. If you do want these I‚Äôd recommend spending the extra few bucks and buying some AKG K240‚Äôs. They are of similar design (because these are a clone of the K240‚Äôs) and similar sound quality but better build quality, even with the modern ones made in china.In summary, these kinda suck and you‚Äôd be better off getting K240‚Äôs or getting these and soldering a better cable on/soldering a connector on like mmcx or mini xlr so you can put your own cables on these
Amateur musician on a pension, my old Sennheisers died and I hoped to get something "good enough" within my budget.  These are far better  than that, excellent reproduction, comfortable to wear and such a good value.
This are great entry level studio headphones. For the price I don't expect removable ear cups or cable. I wish the cable length was just a little longer.
I picked them up off a recommendation from a certain youtuber, and yeah they are absolutely bomb. I had a pair of Beyerdynamic DT880s (600 Ohm) and the right driver broke on me from my own fault (dropped it on accident) so I started to look into some replacements that might not be as expensive. Enter, the second best headphones that I have ever personally owned. I've seen it all from the cheapest Onikuma gaming headsets where sound doesn't come through both cans all the time, to ludacris souls that would shake your soul from how much bass they had, and multiple pairs of AKGs before and after the takeover happened.I have to say, these are incredible, no they are not perfect reference headphones but for $35 I don't think you're finding any that sound incredible and are durable through the test of time. Mine definitely have some cosmetic wear on them, but can confirm that the sound has not taken any damage over the course of my tenure with them. Now I don't know why amazon is asking me to rate the noise cancellation and the bass, as these are open backs so for people who know, they know. If you don't know, about 5 minutes of research will get you caught up.
First off, these are incredibly comfortable. You can wear these for hours because they are self-adjusting and the cups themselves feel really soft for the price point.Second, I hear a lot of complaints about the headphones either not being balanced enough or bassy enough. These are not meant for that. Every headphone sounds different just like every movie is about something different. You can get an expressive nat geo documentary from the hd 600‚Äôs or sharknado from your raycons on both extremes. These are more like a ‚Äúbased on true events‚Äù movie. They sound pretty balanced but have a bit of a ‚Äúv sound‚Äù to make it more appealing for mainstream listeners.Overall, these are great for beginners who want their first pair of at home headphones. For the price you cant beat it.

Hello reader; I assume a fellow music -lover;  Hope you're doing well today; I'm a 61 year old guy from New England and this is  a review of my new Audio-Technica ATH-AVC400 SonicPro Over-Ear Headphones that I  received from Amazon yesterday as a replacement  to my Edifier H850 that served me very well for a year, but just recently the stem of the right earcup started to crumble(brittle plastic),  hope these lines will help you making the right purchasing decision. well these headphones are simply delightfulAsDIO would say: Holy diver! I'll be honest, I'm not a strict audiophile purist who doesn't accept anything  but a laser- straight frequency-curve from 20 to 20000 Hz, I do enjoy a little V-ish  sound so most of the time I need headphones for YouTube music videos, the signal goes through my Logitech Computer speaker system that has a standard 3.5mm stereo female jack on the right speaker, on my Windows10 Sound settings I have the Enhancements/ Equalizer preset set to Rock, plus I added a pinch of extra treble at 8 and 16 kHz to my liking, and I saved it as [Rock XT] extra treble this way I really enjoy the sound on all music styles from Alan Parsons through Joe Satriani to Pet Shop Boys,+Welcome to the Pleasuredome by FGTH and let me tell you these AT headphones do a fantastic job, you don't have to turn the volume up high , even on moderate volume they sound so energetic, substantial across the whole frequency spectrum ; so pleasant quite an improvement over the otherwise excellent Edifier (BTW those are not available from Amazon Anymore). although the H850s had better isolation; through the AT I could hear my wife using the hand mixer in the kitchen I believe these are designed to be semi-open back for better bass response. So far I haven't gotten any complaints from my wife who is sitting right next to me playing on her  own PC no sound leakage. the other thing is they do feel quite warm on my ears at 1 hour of use  it's summer,  hot and humid here in New England,  the fan is spinning above me, but the sound quality is worth it one personal issue that I hope  you don't have to worry about is: my left side is paralyzed due to a stroke 10 years ago, so I can only use my right hand to put them on/ take them off , and that was easier with my Edifier- and earlier my Koss Porta pro. anyway, this was my review, hope it was helpful go and get these! signing off: zocsy. Thanks for reading, take care!
Good quality and price for a wired headphone set. Hopefully it will last.
These are better than expensive ones!
It's a decent pair of headphones as far as weight goes. It also has a self adjusting headband which is a plus.The 2 things that make these 3 stars for me, is the cord while flexible, you can't swap it out if it develops a short.  As anyone can tell you with headphones, what normally happens? cord is normally the first thing to go b/c it develops a short somewhere along the cable. So this is annoying.The other thing that gets me is the faux leather ear pads...  as I've used more headphones, I've come to realize what I appreciate more-WHAT works better. The leather ear pads, while they do cover my ears just fine. They are too hot.As far as I can tell, I can't even buy a different set of ear cushions... ?The sound quality ironically enough does seem to be better than my 'Philips Fidelio X2HR', which honestly surprised me. I guess it's the "sharpness" of the audio, it just seems slightly better.For the price, it's an "ok" pair of headphones. But it could be a lot better with a couple of tweaks.
I bought these in the hopes to use them at the office to drown out my coworkers. They are not ANC, I just wanted isolated sound with the large ear cups. They did block as much noise as a non-ANC could perform.The material all around felt cheap. I was really afraid of the ear cup material ripping.Wearing them for hours they began to buildup heat, even though I was in an air conditioned office.The sound quality was on par with this price point.The Audio Technica ATH-M20X is far superior for $20 more. Better and more durable feel. Better sound quality and isolation. I can wear these for hours at home not in AC without any heat building up. Well worth the $20 higher price tag.
That hinge is completely made of plastic and I'm sure will break soon. Other than that, these are fairly good headphones even for the price. and the isolation is great too
These headphones aren't anywhere near the worst, but they're far from Audio-Technica's higher-end gear. They feel like they are made of decent-enough plastics, the cable is nice, the adaptor is solid, and the sound is good. Whilst I wouldn't incorporate these into my standard studio gear, they're rather nice for standard listening when you don't feel like pulling out the audiophile gear.Overall, they stand up as decent headphones with a decently premium feel, and it's fairly obvious that more of the budget went into the drivers and cable, versus incorporating the more premium features of higher-end AT monitors.
I needed a pair at our church sound system. I was expecting more privacy to hear sound for adjusting a mixing board. But while the quality is good, I have issues hearing over the in house volume I hear also. So I could really use a better pair to block out noise. Yet I have never bought a pair to know what I needed. In general I liked the comfort for even though I feel they look dorky. They don‚Äôt hurt to wear. Really long cord also.
Review for:  Audio-Technica ATH-AVC200 Over-Ear HeadphonesNote that you can also cut the lower headband for more comfort for some sized heads, which I do.PROS:-------- Quite light for over-ear headphones- I find it quite comfortable, especially for an over-ear headphone- You can cut-out the bottom rubber headband for a no-top-of-the-head wearing experience, which is what I do- Sound quality is quite satisfactory, obviously for the price though, not an audiophile experienceCONS:--------- If you have a very large head, the lack of vertical stretch adjustability might be a fit issueI highly recommend giving this headphone a try if your priority is comfort and you need an over the ear headphone.Regards,Neil
I used to use "gaming headsets" but even these low end real headphones sound amazing compared to what even a "headset" that's more than double the price sounds like.

Basic Build:Obviously, the build and appearance of both these headphone will be nearly identical. And that is correct, with the only difference being the outside of the earcups. The build quality of these headphones are among the best I have ever experienced. They are made of very high quality materials and feel very hefty, despite their light weight. The cable is nice and thick and is well connected to the headphone and jack itself. Although coated in an almost stiff plastic, I have no complaints about the cable. The headband, is also incredibly durable, able to withstand horrible abuse. In fact, I conducted an experiment. I actually grabbed the two cups of the headphone, and bent them backwards so that the headphone was completely straight in a  flat line form. After that, I bent the headband in a very tight loop. After all this, the headband looked and functioned exactly as it did before, with absolutely no obvious wear or damage. Although I cannot recommend doing this for stress relief, rest assured that your Beyer headband will never break. If it does, tell me how you did it. Overall build is just fantastic. Beefy parts, solid materials, resistant design, and great feel overall.Appearance:Flat out, these look really quite fantastic. They look especially good when seen in person. In fact, the DT880 is one of the best looking headphones I have yet come across. As discussed in the previous paragraph, there is only one difference in the appearance of the DT880 and the DT990. The DT880 has dotted outer earcups, and the DT990 has slatted outer earcups. In person, and in my opinion, the DT880 looks superior to the DT990. But of course, all of this relies on the users opinion and preference. Both do look great, but the DT880 simply looks better. Most will tell you there are only two differences between the DT880 and the DT990, and that would be the appearance and sound. But I am here to tell you, that there is actually a third difference in which sets these two apart, and I will go into more detail on that in the upcoming paragraphs.Function:Since these headphones are identical build wise, this lead to the exact same headband adjustment. The headband adjustment on these headphones, is good, but not great. So far, the D2000 is clearly the king of adjustment, with it's superior clicking adjustment device. The Beyer headphones on the other hand, are a bit harder to adjust to your desired size. On the insides of the earcup arms, you will see many dots -- all of which indicate how far out the headphone is adjusted. From what I can recall, there are eight of them, with which being at eighth dot is the headphone at full size. Pulling them out can sometimes be a bit resistant at times, but once you get the specific size you want, you don't have to adjust them anymore, so it's really not a problem. This is actually quite similar to the HD650, except the HD650 doesn't have any way to guide you into how far you've pulled them out, so balanced adjustment relies on your eyes. Although, Beyer definitely isn't the worst, but definitely not the best when it comes to adjustment. The interesting thing about these headphones though, is even fully adjusted to the eighth dot, the headphone really isn't that big. So what does this mean? This means, if you close them all the way in, the are absolutely tiny, and can be great for storage or display. For some reason, they look even more fantastic when they are in their tiny form, but again, just another opinion.--------------------Initial Comfort:This is where both of these headphones differ from each other. But first, let me explain their initial comfort. Most people know by now that Beyerdynamic headphones are very comfortable. And I am happy to report, this is true -- but to some extent. The earpads a very soft indeed, and feel very good while wearing them. And the headband is generously padded as well, so most will find it comfortable too. But there is a slight problem with both of these headphones in terms of comfort -- especially with the DT880. First let me clarify that this may not be a problem to users with very small ears. To those of us with medium to large ears, there is a slight problem. Both of the earcups on these headphones are really quite shallow. In which, your ear WILL most likely be touching the inner foam of the earcups. To many this isn't a problem, but to some, it is the end of the world. The interesting thing is, the DT880 has "curved" foam inside it's earcup and the DT990 has "flat" foam inside it's earcup. This is extremely apparent not only while wearing them, but by taking off the earpads, it's clear they are to what I have stated. What this means is, your ear is much more likely to not only touch, but be irritated by the inside foam while wearing the DT880, than the DT990. Putting them on back and forth reveals that this issue is obvious, and the DT990 is clearly a step ahead of the DT880 in terms of comfort -- which is a real shame, because the DT880 sounds superior to the DT990. With that said, the DT990 feels absolutely fantastic when first placed on your head. It's pillow-like feel, and the relatively soft headband makes these a joy to wear.Long Term Comfort:Many will overlook something as important as long term comfort. They look for the initial shock in how comfortable a headphone is, and leave it at that. Unfortunately, no headphone I have ever owned feels the same after even half an hour after you put them on -- excluding the king of comfort, the AD700. No matter how soft, or how good they feel when you first put them on, they WILL feel different after extended wear. That said, the DT880 began to irritate me in less than a half an hour. Not only did my ears not like the semi-claustrophobic earcups, but they really detested to the foam. The DT990 on the other hand, even from initial wear, is quite obvious that they will be more comfortable down the road -- and they were. Unfortunately, I have only worn these for a little less than an hour, but with that, they still felt pretty good. Most may not even keep them on that long anyway, so in that case, the DT990 passes the test with flying colors. Sadly for the DT880, it's curved foam inside the earcup disabled me from wearing them for anywhere near as long as the DT990. A sad fact indeed, as I already mentioned that I liked the sound of the DT880 loads more than the DT990. That of which I will go onto in the next section.--------------------Bass:And now comes the section in which the DT880 and the DT990 differ most. The sound. Let's start out with the basics and begin with bass. Between the two, it's quite apparent that the bass is indeed different. Instead of putting it into confusing terms and long descriptions, I'll put it nice and simple. The DT990 has MORE bass, the DT880 has LESS bass. Yup, it's that simple, and is that self-explanatory. The DT880 has very "safe" bass, in which most will be happy with the bass it has to offer. It's not too much, nor is it too little, thus it's the perfect amount. I will definitely agree with that to some extent. Between the two headphones, the DT880 has the more favorable bass. In some songs, it had too little, just as the DT990 had too much. But the DT880's bass is safe -- in which it sounds perfectly acceptable and it won't be fatiguing, at all. It's deep, it's balanced, and it's clear. The DT990 on the other hand, is a bit more risky. It does indeed have more bass, but some can find it fatiguing, just as some will love the addition of more of it. To play it safe AND if I could keep one for bass alone, I would choose the DT880 no question. For fun listening, rock sessions, laid back, or analytical examining, I would still pick the DT880 for all of those categories.Treble and Overall Sound:This is where the storm begins. The treble is without a doubt, the trademark of Beyerdynamic headphones. They are bright, energetic, and detailed -- thanks to their overemphasized treble. But where they get their strength, is also where they get their weakness. Too much treble. Far too much. I'm writing this comparison to obviously compare and review the DT880 and DT990, and not to criticize it's sound based off listening to the HD650, but what I hear is what I hear, and I will share my findings. The DT880 and the DT990 are simply too bright for my tastes. With it's brightness also comes it's detail and energy, but also comes it's dryness, lack of body, and hollow sound. It actually reminds me of Grado headphones in a way that it has a very upfront and engaging sound. Due to this, I find it not only fatiguing listening to both, but find it not as enjoyable due to something being "left out" in the sound. To describe this, I will give you a mental image of their general sound signature. With "higher" equaling "treble" and "lower" equaling "bass", the Beyer's sound resembles an "upside down pyramid". Little support at the bottom, and too much weight up top. Due to this shape, the sound like I mentioned, sounds very dry, lacks body, and has a relatively hollow sound -- but with that has a very sharp and detailed sound. But, with all this information describing Beyer in a general sense, or more so the DT880, I will now give you a glimpse into the strange, twisted world of the DT990.After discovering my DT880 was too bright when compared to my reference HD650, I completely forget to also compare it to the DT990. I tested the DT880 vs the HD650 extensively, and only tested the DT880 and the DT990 briefly in the past (I quickly came to the conclusion I found the DT880's sound superior to the DT990, so I discarded the DT990 temporarily). So, after my extensive tests between the DT880 and the HD650, coming to the conclusion the DT880 was too bright, I went ahead and threw the DT990 back into the mix. Let's just say, I was blown away with the sheer amount of treble they presented. It was, in short, appalling. It was so incredibly bright, it rendered them almost unlistenable with all the variety of music I threw at it. With brightness comes sibilance, and with sibilance comes fatigue. The sound of the DT990 was so bright, it felt as if it was covering up all the other details in the music. Instead of the sound being "veiled" it was more like being "tinned", as everything in the sound had such a bright shimmer, which seemed to detract from the overall enjoyment. But, to make things even more interesting, the DT990 has enhanced bass as well. Now we have a bit too much bass that can blur into the mids, and WAY too much treble that eats the rest of the spectrum! An incredibly twisted sound if you ask me, but many may find it amusing! Overall, both of these headphones are extremely bright and lack bodied, balanced sound. The DT990 just takes that to the next level -- by offering an even brighter sound, and bass that can also render fatigued listening. In all, the DT990 is a very strange (and not preferred) headphone indeed. Getting fatigued by bass and treble at the same time is really quite the experience! The DT880 is a "tamed" DT990, and for that, it sounds much better for all kinds of music.--------------------Recommendation:Whatever you do, try them first if that's an option. Beyerdyanmic headphones give me more mixed reactions than any headphone I have ever tried, and to that, you really should try to listen to them and possibly compare, before you buy. If that's not an option, and you think the words: bright, dry, upfront, energetic, and detailed might engage you, then go ahead and buy the DT880, unless you are feeling extremely courageous and want to risk it with the DT990. But, if you feel like you want a more: balanced, emotional, full bodied, complete, unobtrusive, and smooth sound, then I strongly recommend the fabulous HD650. Whatever you decide, remember, I warned you about the DT990, so if you still choose to get it, may your ears endure such a sound...
I am not much of a headphone person - I always prefer speakers, but I can't listen to them during the day when working from home as I have my significant other working from home as well. I have a bunch of budget headphones including HE4XX, 58x Jubilee, and the DT 770 80ohm. I bought a xDuoo TA-26 to use as a preamp for speaker system, but it was just OK for that purpose and I kept reading how high impedance cans sound good with the TA-26. So this amp drove my curiosity to try out the 880 600 ohm as a budget choice.Before getting the DT 880 600ohm, I actually first got the DT 990 600ohm because I read how the bass in the DT 880 would be lacking. However, I could not stand the brightness of the DT 990 and returned it immediately. It was simply too much even though I use a Denafrips Ares II for a DAC (smoother sounding R2R), and upgraded smoother tubes on the TA-26 (ShuGuang CV181-Z, Soviet 6N5S).Comparing the DT 880 600 ohm to my DT 770 80 ohm, the flatter response of the DT 880 ohm immediately becomes apparent. DT 770 sounds somewhat boomy in comparison, though I suspect that is exactly what some might be looking for esp. movie watching. It took a few songs for me to get used to the DT 880, but soon I began to prefer it over the DT 770.DT 880 is definitely more for audiophiles wanting a balanced sound - I am used to the balanced sound on my speakers as I use DIRAC Live with its linear gradual slope target curve and this headphone is the closest to that sound profile. Bass is very much there in spades if the music itself has it, but does not artificially add to it (which feels "boomy" to me). The result of this flatter response is that the bass doesn't overwhelm the music and so you are able to appreciate the details across the entire frequency range. While flatter, it is in no way dull and definitely on the energetic side likely due to its mildly pronounced treble.My only criticism of the DT 880 is that it has some of the brightness of the DT 990 600 ohm. Even if it is considerably toned down compared to the 990, it can get to be a bit much for harsh recordings or long listening sessions.TA-26 was able to drive the DT 880 600 ohm to sufficient volume levels. Any louder and hearing is likely to get damaged for long sessions. Where the DT 770 80 ohm presented itself with a noisy hum coming out of TA-26, the DT 800 600 ohm presented it only faintly. I suspect the difference in impedance is likely causing the difference. I have found that it was best to max out the volume on the TA-26 and use my source to control gain, rather than the other way around as I was hearing significant distortion suggesting that the headphones wasn't getting sufficient power.I never took a liking to the 58x; always sounded a bit dull for my taste. Maybe Sennheisers are not for me. The HE4XX were used mostly for electronic music or watching non-music content. I use it with a xDuoo MT-602, but I expect to shift to the DT 880 for all music going forward. The DT 880 also sounds more full bodied and its brightness tamed a bit with the TA-26 compared to the MT-602. The TA-26/DT 880 600ohm pairing along with a semi-decent dac (a used Sanskrit 10th MK II at the cheap end) is the one to get if looking for a full package.So in summary:Bass: 770 80 ohm > 990 600 ohm > 880 600 ohmBrightness: 990 600 ohm (harsh) > 880 600 ohm > 770 80 ohmUpdates:1. I tried using the Brainwavzaudio sheepskin memory foam earpads and while it tamed the brightness of the headphone, it made it very dark sounding. Be very careful choosing aftermarket earpads with the DT 880 because of its very delicate and revealing nature.2. I tried ASR's EQ suggestions using Equalizer APO and they sound even better with the harshness tamed. Here is the Equalizer APO config file if anyone is interested.Preamp: -4.3 dBFilter 1: ON LS Fc 60 Hz Gain 4.0 dB Q 1.0Filter 2: ON PK Fc 210 Hz Gain -2.0 dB Q 2.0Filter 3: ON PK Fc 4300 Hz Gain 4.0 dB Q 4.0Filter 4: ON PK Fc 5700 Hz Gain -6.0 dB Q 5.0Filter 5: ON PK Fc 8300 Hz Gain -7.0 dB Q 5.03. The longer I have been using the DT880-600 with the TA-26, the more I have become aware of it its very good imaging capabilities. I also now have the CSS Audio 1TDX speakers which have similarly spectacular imaging and glad to have the DT880 when I can't listen on the 1TDX. However, the sound staging of speakers remains unmatched ("front of you, behind the speakers" vs. "in your head, slightly above like a voice/stage of god?"), and the room pressurization by the subwoofer in the speaker system feels more visceral than headphones. Because of this, the DT880-600 will always remain my 2nd preference, to be used when I can't use speakers.
In my quest for a reasonably expensive headphone to beat my actual favorite, the AKG Q701, I often did read about the Beyerdynamic headphones and I decided to try the DT880. Considering that I am very often using my Iphone 4 with or without a headphone amp, I decided to go for the 32 Ohms model. I made sure to give it a fair burn-in time so for a week, I did let it run almost constantly with some variation of music and pink and white noises. Today, I can estimate the burn-in to have passed the bar of 100 hours.In order to compare effectively the two models, I will use my Iphone alone in the first place and then add a FiiO E-11 and reuse the same tracks. I expect the AKG to under perform with no amp as this phone is very power hungry. The tracks I will use are those that I always use when trying to compare headphones, because I love them first but also because I know how they should sound and more importantly because they provide a good sample of music genres and tonalities. The tracks will be compressed at 320Kbps and are as follow:- Ultrasone Sound test Siley Put short (Jazz, Binaural recording perfect for localization of sounds).- Ultrasone sound test Wellen track 7 (sound of water waves perfect for the head stage definition).- Frank Sinatra: How insensitive (Jazz, good also for localization of sounds).- Robin Thicke: Lost Without you and Angel (Perfect for the voice testing and for bass impact).- Pink Floyd: Astronomy Domine from A piper at the gates of dawn (Rock and excellent also for the localization of sounds).- DJ Magic Mike: Feel the Bass (Infra-Bass, enough said...) will be played from my computer because it is missing on the Iphone.But first, let's start with the non musical parts:Comfort: The Beyerdynamic DT880 Premium 32 Ohms are extremely comfortable. Their pads are the softest I have ever experienced and rest comfortably around your ears. On the top of your head, I think it is some faux leather. The pressure level is absolutely fine. They are slightly heavier than the AKG but I would still give them 5 stars. The AKG are also extremely comfortable. Their cushions aren't as soft but they also fit like a dream around my ears and the pressure is lesser. I can keep them on for hours.Conclusion: DT880 : 1. AKG: 1.Price: I paid $255 for the AKG (MSRP $479)and $309 for the DT880 (MSRP $359).It could be deducted from the pricing that the DT880 keep a better value than the AKG. Personally, I do not know what to make of this. One may deduct that the MSRP was overblown for the AKG or that the DT880 are overpriced now. While looking at the final price, the AKG appears as the better deal.Conclusion: DT880 : 0. AKG: 1.Packaging:The AKG come with two cables but no carrying case. Both cables are green and of high quality. Both are too long for a portable use. The cables are easy to connect or disconnect and it is a plus because most times, the cable is failing before the rest.  Since these headphones are not meant for a portable use, a carrying case was not really necessary.The DT880 come with only one cable and it is not removable. It is also a bit long for a portable use. It also comes with a huge carrying case. I like it because it is sure to protect it but it is way too bulky for thinking about using it when I travel.Conclusion: DT880 : 0. AKG: 1.Sound Isolation:The AKG Q701 are an open design.The DT880 are a semi open design.Both are leaking quite a lot and are not meant for use in public areas. Although the DT880 are slightly more portable, I would still not make them my choice for outdoor use. Both should be kept for home use, listening to music or playing video games (both are excellent at it).Conclusion: DT880 : 0. AKG: 0.Now, let's come to the real important part of this test: the sound. I will start by saying that the sound for both was really good out of the box but improved quite a lot with the burn-in time. My first impression before going any further is that they are quite similar, with maybe the AKG sounding a bit more natural and with a larger head stage (open design versus the semi open design of the DT880) and the DT 880 with the mids a bit more forward and overall more powerful. I may sometimes find the DT880 a bit more tiring. Note that the 68 Ohms of the AKG are very deceptive since they sound as hard to drive as maybe a 300 Ohms headphone set.I will finish this introduction by saying that I am partial to a large head stage and as natural a sound as possible. I like analytical headphones and so far the AKG proved perfect in that field.Ok, let's start:- Ultrasone Sound test Siley Put short (Jazz, Binaural recording perfect for localization of sounds).Both headphones delivered very well on this track. The DT880 were a bit more powerful than the AKG. The AKG sounded a bit more precise but this is by a hair...- Ultrasone sound test Wellen track 7 (sound of water waves perfect for the head stage definition).Once again, it is a wash between the two. Both are delivering well on every detail and head stage. You really feel the waves coming from afar, getting past you and going the other direction. Some birds are heard in the distance to the right and one come your direction and it is well rendered by both sets.- Frank Sinatra: How insensitive (Jazz, good also for localization of sounds).The DT880 are definitely more powerful. The voices are more recessed but still present on the AKG. Both deliver nicely and I cannot fault any. Though they sound different, nothing is missing for either. Amped or not , both sound magnificent.- Robin Thicke: Lost Without you and Angel (Perfect for the voice testing and bass punch).These songs are nicely performed with both headphones. Their signature is different again, with the mids a bit more present for the DT880 and also more power. Once the FiiO amp is connected, the bass improvement is slightly better on the DT880.- Pink Floyd: Astronomy Domine (Rock and excellent also for the localization of sounds).I like the AKG better on this song but it is not because the DT880 are at fault. Once again, the mids are not as forward on the AKG and it gives me an impression of neutrality more visible than with the DT880. But once again, the DT880 offer a superb delivery.Used with the FiiO E11, the AKG start shining and takes a slight edge in my listening pleasure.- DJ Magic Mike: Feel the Bass (Infra-Bass, enough said...) will be played from my computer because it is missing on the Iphone.The infra-bass is maybe the most difficult sound for any headphone to reproduce. I failed completely a Sennheiser 598 for it's lack in reproducing it. In this case, both do work well, with once again the DT880 more powerful without an amp. Without a proper amp, the AKG won't be the best because of the power limitation.With the amplification provided by the FiiO E11 turned to the max, the DT880 start distorting slightly and leave me with a tingling in the ears due to the vibration of the diaphragms. This does not happen with the AKG. When I try to use a similar comfort level for my ears, the AKG appear slightly better.Conclusion:I have failed to find better than the AKG Q701 but I found it's equal in the DT880 Premium. I would suggest going for the DT880 if most of the use is done without an amp or if one prefers the mids a bit more forward. I would suggest to go with the AKG if the price is an important factor (you will save about $60) and if you like a more neutral sound. In either case, the Beyerdynamic DT880 Premium is a first class headphone!
If you are looking for an Audiophile experience with out of the world bass extension...you're gonna need Sonarworks Sound ID Reference...or some sort of EQ correction because the "out of the box" bass experience is not great....however....once you enable digital EQ corrections...this headphone is fully capable of producing great deep bass while retaining its clarity in the highs without choking out, sounding more compressed...etc etc...compared to lots of other studio headphones around the same price range. So out of the box...don't expect Audiophile perfection...but with a bit of EQ correction via SoundID Reference...hollyyyyyyyyyyy is this near perfection.These are the only headphones I have ever had to adjust or take off...to make sure that the studio main monitors aren't playing...and it is in fact these headphones that is making the sound and not the main monitors. Especially when you combine this with something like the Waves NX Headphone system...wow...just wow. All I can say is technology is awesome. And then when you want to do some sibilance correction just turn off the EQ correction software...and bam...the problem areas REALLYYYY stick out all of a sudden.So basically without EQ correction...this is still a great studio headphone...but I would say primarily for making music rather than listening to it. With EQ correction...oh my are these great for everything. I don't think you are buying this headphone for its bass. You are buying it for its mid range, and especially high treble clarity. In that aspect...this headphone at the price in which I got it...I think is either top of class or near it. Maybe HD6XX...but it is more expensive. Pound for pound best headphones I have owned. PS...I am using an Audient ID interface as headphone amp.
The Beyerdynamic DT880 Premium Ed. 600-ohm is a dynamic driver, semi-open (basically open) around-ear headphone designed for professional-use cases with professional-grade gear. It's been hyped up a fair bit recently even though it's been on the market for a long time. Does it live up to that hype?TL;DR - It's a great headphone. More neutral than 770, and not as bright or sibilant at 990. More soundstage than HD 600-series and better imaging. Absolutely does NOT require "ALL THE POWER" to drive, but needs more than portable gear can offer.Packaging, Build & Accessories - Comes in a cardboard box with a graphic. Inside is a zippered, leatherette carrying case with a foam cutout for the headphone and cable. Pretty standard fare. Comes with it's carrying case, and a threaded 1/4" adapter.Mostly plastic build, with metal grills, yokes, and a metal band that runs through a padded-leatherette wrap. As it's a single cable from the left ear-cup, there is an exposed, black rubber wrapped cable coming out of the top of each ear-cup. The pads are actually the silver pads from the DT 990 and are not "880-specific". It feels like it's designed to survive some sh*t, as any headphone designed for professional use should.Sound - It really is quite neutral. It sounds good, like it's been tuned following research and time. More treble energy than HD 600 but hasn't ever hurt like the HE-350 did, with tracks mastered too hot. Seems to have more bass than HD 600 as well. However, it seems to change it's sound based on the output impedance of whatever it's plugged into...600 Ohm headphones should ideally sound the same with almost any gear, but really low OI gear seemed to have a change in the low frequency region, sounding a bit more bloated, and melding a bit with the midrange. Using them with more higher Z-out sources yielded the best sound to my ears. The Topping DX7 Pro has around 10-ohms of Z-out, and according to available material, the Emotiva A100 BasX has around 200-Ohms, and the Darkvoice 336se has >100-ohms as well. These are the amps that sounded the best. Subtle differences, but that was my preference.Conclusions - As someone who listens to music as a hobby and not a profession, I feel these are worth their asking price. I tried them with a variety of amps and I consistently found that higher output impedances are my preference for getting the best sound out of them. That makes sense though, because a lot of professional gear has higher Z-out. 880 600-Ohm isn't bad, or unlistenable with sub-1-ohm output impedance sources or anything though.The DT 880 600-ohm has a max power handling of 100mW per channel. That means, if you amplifier can output around 100mW or better at @ 600 Ohms, it's more than capable of driving these to destruction. For reference, the BasX A100 in direct drive mode can output a claimed 600mW into 600-ohms, and 200mW into 600-Ohms in normal mode! Way more than enough power to drive these hard AF. Heck, the Topping DX7 Pro gets these plenty loud and sounding good for most music around -20 dB in high-gain. I had to max it out when I was watching some TV shows with tracks mastered quietly, but still.I want to remind people not to believe everything you hear or read on the internet. My power numbers come direct from Beyerdynamic's, and Emotiva's websites. Do your own research to determine what is necessary. You definitely don't need a BasX A100 in direct drive mode WITH a DAC running more than 2 volts to drive these to satisfying volumes, but you will likely need more than an Apple Dongle, DAP, or USB bus-powered amp.However, these are a fine mid-fi headphone and definitely worthy of being added to most folk's stable.*Disclaimer* - I have not been paid or otherwise had someone attempt to influence the content of this review. All thoughts and opinions are my own. My ears are not a universal measurement rig. Perception of audio is subjective and no review is a suitable substitute for ears-on time with a product.
After owning the DT 990 Pro 250 for a year, I decided to get these to compare and obviously keep. While I read that the DT 880 are light on bass, according to my ears, they're only light on impact. The bass is there, ALL OF IT,  but it's not felt...doesn't fill the ears like the DT 990 Pro. So by result, the bass is more detailed and nuanced. The trade-off is worth it. The DT 880 600 ohm are what my ears expected of the DT 990, which has too much treble for my liking. My Schiit Asgard 2 rounds off that treble nicely, though. The DT 880 are BRIGHT on their own. If you have heard them and consider them too piercing, the DT 990 are DT 880s on steroids.The bass is big and also the highs...while the midrange is thinner. That is what I like about the DT 880...that they are as revealing as the DT 990 but without sounding so thin in the middle. They're flatter, while the DT 990 sound V-shaped.Lots of people say the DT 880 are the boring ones and the DT 990 are the fun ones. While I get what they mean by that, I don't consider the DT 880 boring at all. They're flatter-sounding, but they do not sound...flat. They're way livelier and more intense than a lot of headphones. If you want to experience truly boring headphones, try the super flat and revealing Senal SMH-1200. Those make any music sound boring and lifeless with their empty, dry sound signature...but are awesome as audio loupes.Anyway, I agree with beyerdynamic's descriptions: the DT 880 are for reference monitoring and the DT 990 are for critical listening and mastering. Having music production as a hobby since 2002, it makes sense to me and their sound signatures are the proof.Oh, I wanted to mention that good conversion/amplification gets rid of the "metallic tone" and sibilance of beyerdynamic headphones. It's been established that the Sennheiser HD 650/6XX scale up with gear, and they do scale up, but so do these, and more noticeably. The better the equipment and the more power, the better they sound.Thanks for reading. God bless you![EDIT-June 13, 2020]I like to read reviews, sure, but ultimately, I trust my own ears/brain. I completely disregard what other ears/brains hear. What use are they to me, right? I've been comparing these with my beyerdynamic T90 Jubilee using the beastly Tascam UH-7000 and the original Schiit Asgard, which sounds great.The DT 880 are less exciting in terms of energy, since the sound is not so "in-your-face", but there is something about the DT 880's presentation that I like more. They sound more "out of the head", "wider" side to side and more "layered" from foreground to background.The DT 880 are just more balanced from lows to highs frequency and energy-wise, as if they had a transparent compressor. Weirdly, to my surprise, they also translate more emotion, even if they are reference headphones and not Hi-Fi headphones like the T90. Those I admit are more musical-sounding, BUT, musicality and musical emotion are two different things in my book.The sound stage on the DT 880 is not so "zoomed-in" like in the T90, so they don't sound as full, but that "distance" in the sound presentation makes the DT 880 transmit something that the T90 lack. The DT 880 sound more "lonely" and not as ear-filling, which is something that kills a lot of headphones for me, but somehow, I precisely like that about them.It might seem like an undesirable trait, but I am sure that, regardless of experience level, trained ear or not, anyone could understand what I mean if they were to compare both side by side. The DT 880 simply affect me more emotionally even if the T90 are the obvious winners in the technical performance department.Is this preference of mine due to the DT 880's design PLUS the drivers having way higher impedance and requiring more juice from the amp, which results in the drivers behaving differently in a way above my knowledge level? I have no clue. All I know is I somehow feel some kind of relief taking off the T90 and wearing the DT 880 even if they sound "smaller", more "distant" and less ear-filling. I can wear the T90 and go, "Wow, these sound incredible". Then I take them off, wear the DT 880 and go, "Aaaaah, I SO missed this...whatever THIS is." The T90 are tonally clearer, but the DT 880's overall sound presentation is clearer, as if filtered. They are very, very different headphones. The T90 sound better technically, but the DT 880 emotionally take me to a better place.Ever since I got the DT 880, I've been saying to myself that they are special. It just took me a long while to figure out what it was. Yeah, the DT 990 are no slouches, but they don't transmit the emotion that the DT 880 do. The DT 880 simply touch my feelings in a unique way. Just wanted to share this with you guys!
My review on these headphones will be more on my overall opinion of the headphones than a focus on the sound.  I will be giving it a hard time and say what I think on little details, but again I am being critical.  My first comment will be on comfort.  I find the headphones to be mostly comfortable, but not the most comfortable out there.  The earpads are soft, but because of the size of the opening they are mostly comfortable although I wouldn't consider them to be a set of headphones that disappear on your head.  The headband comfort is padded well enough, but what makes it comfortable is more of how light the headphones are.  I am glad that the cords are single ended as this well add more to the comfort.  I find headphones like the HD598 more comfortable due to the size of the earpads will fit your whole ear inside while still giving you the same lightweight comfort.  Okay now on to the build.  I have mix feelings about the built and overall construction.  I thought overall the arm adjustment for size is not the best I have seen.  I find the when adjusting the size of the arms, it's seems clumsy.  I am glad that they do include the notches to see how far you have adjust them unlike headphones like the Sennheiser HD598/HD558.  The flaw of them are that they are not the smoothest when you change from one notch to the next.  I find that sometime I have to push harder just to get them to go to the next notch and sometime I end up going two notches.  Compare to the HD598/558 or Audio Technica ESW9 or the D2000, the process seems clumsy and annoying. (D2000 has the best I have seen on a headphone)  Another thing about this is their seem to be a metal tab on the outer top part of the DT880 arm which usually I assume is for you to place your thumb there to adjust like some of the the other headphones I previously owned, but in the DT880 it's practically useless and more for decor.  That metal tab when used to slide the arm will press against the headband will cause it to halt the sliding process. Now onto the appearance of the arm, when you look at the inside of it, the arm looks like it is missing an outer coating to make it smoother to touch.  I also don't like that the cable is not removable and the part where it goes inside the cup is thicker/big.  As for the bag, I wish the top flap of the bag has a little bit of cushion to fully protect it from be bumped. The bag is a very minor complain as I find it to be one of the best bag that comes with a headphone. I also think they could of put a little bit of cushion on the top of the headband to give it a bit more of a premium feel.  Again, all of these complaint are not something that would sway me from this headphone, but things I see could make these headphones even better.  Now that I got all of my thoughts on what I don't like, here is what I do like.  I find the DT880 to have a wonderful sound presentation.  The one I own now is the 32 Ohm version.  I find the volume control loudness is great as I find myself perfectly content with the volume set around 45 to 55% on my laptop without any sort of amp.  The sound quality sounds great and I have no issue with it without and amp. I do believe they perform better than the HD598 (a headphone I use without an amp) by having tighter bass, better clarity, less veil mids, more 3D presentation, better imaging.  The soundstage seems very appropriate and uniform.  The overall sound signature seems to be well balance without bleeding into each other.  What I am also glade about the 32 Ohm version is that there are improvements with an amp if wish to use one.  I also find the looks of the DT880 to be easily liked and not offensive.  The weight of the headphones itself is very light and light when it is in the bag.  The bag seems to be well design to where the wire is not cramp and the not removable cable won't get strained from pressure of being press upon. the cable is not so thick, not microphonic, kinks, and the connector are not huge.  The 1/4 attachment are screw on which is nice.  Overall I give the DT880 a five star because it serves the purpose I need it for:To be able to be used without an amp, comfortable enough for me to use for long periods of time, versatile enough for me to listen to most music, great for movies, a good enough case for me to bring it along when I travel, and it sounds fantastic at a great price point.Update 10/14/14: I found out a couple of things after owning them a little bit longer.  The fit of the DT880 is a little bit smaller than then my other headphones and after extending the arms and pushing the cups toward the back of my head, comfort is a whole lot better.  I also believe the side metal piece between the headband and arms are actually for the fit of the headphones.
I was looking for a good set of headphones to replace my out dated astro a40 and desided on these and they don't disappoint the 880s give you that happy middle ground between the open back 770s and the closed back 990s I'm far from an audiophile but the sound om theses is great you get nice bass clear trebble with just a little bleed through from background noise from within your room so perfect if your looking to run a mod mic off it to witch mounts perfectly to the 880 badge on eather side of the headphones normally I write a few cons but coneing from Astros to this I'm afraid I don't have any out side needing an amp/dac to power them but if your looking at these I'm sure your already aware of that
This is the second time I've owned a pair of Beyerdynamic headphones. Between now and then I've owned AKG 701s, and a pair of unfortunately fragile Sennheiser 650s. I've returned to beyerdynamic's for two reasons price and sound.I love my AKG 701s, but they took a ridiculous amount of time to burn in. It was only after several hundred hours of continuous play that they lost their new headphone harshness and became truly musical. I was going to return to them this time around, but the AKG company has been bought by Harman and the factory has been moved from Austria to China. They claim production is of similar quality but a number of recent buyers aren't happy. Even with a price drop I simply cannot justify spending the money needed to buy another set of Sennheiser's. So, I'm back to Beyerdynamic. I have to say, I'm very happy with my decision.The last time my 880s cost nearly half again as much more and came with a beautiful aluminium carrying case. The price is a lot more reasonable now and the case is leatherette, but I don't much mind as the sonic qualities are the same: they are precise and accurate. If there is a flaw in the recording these cans won't hide it. On the other hand a superb recording will take you places with these headphones that you may never have been before. They are also very easy to wear. Though not the lightest high-performance headphones on the market, the weight is well-balanced and the clamping force over one's ears is not too heavy. I'd say actually that there are a lot easier to wear than the Sennheiser's.I was worried that I might have to endure a long breaking in. I needn't have worried. I listened to three pieces in my first sitting. First was Beethoven's 15 Piano Variations and Fugue in D flat in the 2006 Deutsche Gramophone recording of Emil Gilels. It was everything that you would expect of this music and this artist. From the resonance of the repeated low strikes alternating with rapid legato runs. Gilels makes the piano breath and everything sounds exactly right ‚Äî from the resonances of those low tones to his glistening light touches in the upper registers. This recording is done very intimately and listening with these headphones one feels not only as if you were in the same room, but perhaps sharing the bench.I listened next to Glenn Gould's 1980 recording of J.S. Bach's Toccata in f sharp minor, BWV 910. Where Gilel's Beethoven was warm and dramatic, Glenn Gould's performance has a kind of precision that uses the piano in a very different way. In the end it is perhaps even more exciting, but it gets there through a kind of uniformity of touch that allows JS Bach's layering of tones to emerge unsullied. In his time Gould was highly criticised for using exaggerated tempos ‚Äî too slow or too fast ‚Äî but these recording seems spot on to me. There's very little room presence in these recordings (and this is exactly as Gould liked) instead these headphones reveal a piano that seems to surround the listener. Instead of sitting next to the pianist, instead magically it's almost as if one is living inside the piano hearing every hit of hammer on string, minute sounds of the keyboard mechanism, and the faint sounds of Glenn Gould humming in the distance.  Absolutely magical!Finally for something completely different, I listened to Miles Davis's Masqualero (the original Album version, not the awful remastered botch) from his incredible 1967 album "Sorcerer." Everything is there from Davises raspy aggressive tone to Wayne Shorter's incredible saxophone (it's as if he can make the instrument speak your language ‚Äî whatever the language is). The percussion work is superb Even a simple repeated strike of the cymbal (that covers many bars of the piece) seems to be alive. Thank you Tony Williams. Herbie Hancock on piano and Ron Carter on double bass complete quintet. The recording is spacious and has lots of air ‚Äî even as it still manages to seem very intimate. You can imagine that you might be sitting in the front table small club. You hear every articulation ‚Äî the sounds of hard key strikes on the saxophone when Wayne shorter gets moving, and of course Miles Davis breathing life into his trumpet. These headphones make it easy to just close your eyes and be there.It's possible things will change with these headphones as they are broken in, and if anything bad happens I will revisit this review but for the moment let's say I'm a very happy customer of a fine German company.
To start with, readers of this review must realize that the 250-ohm version of these phones was designed by beyerdynamic to be used with a fairly powerful home audio system. The 32-ohm version was designed to be a better match for the iPod/laptop crowd... of which I am not a member.For me, the reason for this purchase was rather specific: I have a moderately high-end 5.1 home theater setup (Yamaha / Klipsch / Philips / Toshiba / 58" Samsung Hi-Def Plasma), and for quite a while now, I've been looking for a way to watch DVDs and listen to CDs late at night, without disturbing my neighbors (I live in a fairly upscale 55+ mobile home park)... but also without losing the incredibly accurate sound fidelity to which I have become deeply and happily accustomed.Finally -- having read almost every online review that exists of the 880's and their chief competitors -- based on my listening tastes, I decided on the 880 Premiums.Upon first listening to them, I will admit that they seemed to be very slightly treble-heavy -- and a bit light on the bass end. Even so... without any break-in at all, I thought they sounded REALLY amazing -- very clear and clean -- and initially, I honestly could not have been more surprised and pleased.That was two weeks ago. Since then -- while I've listened to a number of CDs and watched several DVDs -- in order to more rapidly burn them in, I've been playing CDs through them almost around-the-clock, with them mounted on a foam cushion, instead of my head. As of this evening, they have accumulated just over 200 hours of use, so I consider the burn-in to have reached completion, and -- as I'd hoped -- the further into the burn-in process the 880's have gone, the more even, smooth and true they've ended up sounding. So, amazingly, what started out as being phenomenally good -- to my ears, at least -- has gotten INFINITELY better!While my DVD collection includes every type of film imaginable, my CDs and music-concert DVDs are primarily jazz and classical. Last night, I watched Pat Metheny's "Speaking of Now: Live" DVD, and even though the spacial representation of DTS 5.1 is lost, the accuracy of sound reproduction through the 880's was flawless, and their sound stage is open enough that I never felt as though I wasn't "in" the film. I also found this to be true while watching my Blu-Ray of "Avatar" the night before; COMPLETELY realistic.Tonight, I watched my Blu-Ray of "Jeff Beck - performing this week... live at Ronnie Scott's", featuring the 20-something phenom Tal Wilkenfeld on electric bass. Let me just say... while many reviewers seem to feel that the 880's bass response is somewhat lacking, I personally am ASTOUNDED at their ability to so clearly define, express, and reproduce every nuance of intonation and touch in the playing (for instance) of acoustic standup bass... right down to the lowest notes of which the instrument is capable. At the same time, neither deep electric bass notes nor loud, low drumtones are ever the least bit harsh, distorted, or uncomfortable in any way... yet they are fully, perfectly, and accurately THERE. Pure pleasure!And while the 880's certainly can't reproduce the (literally) earth-shaking Low Frequency Effects of which my 12-inch Klipsch sub-woofer is capable, the very-low-frequency response of these phones, in the midst of explosive, calamitous film action, is FAR beyond my expectations. Several times now, in fact, in the middle of some on-screen battle or disaster scene, I honestly have spontaneously taken the 880's off my ears, just to make sure that my sound system really was NOT on!Final evaluation: WOW. I absolutely LOVE them!Update, December 13, 2012:By way of reinforcing my conclusions, as represented in the above review, I'd like to add that, over the past eighteen months, I have become so enthralled with the accuracy of sound reproduction of the 880 Premiums, and with how incredibly comfortable they are (again -- so as not to disturb my neighbors late at night -- I often wear them for four or five hours at a time), that I bought a second pair of them a few weeks ago, so that a visiting friend can enjoy a (sometimes exceedingly loud) late-evening film or CD with me.And what's truly nice about that, is that even though we're both wearing headphones, it remains a genuinely "shared" experience... which would not be possible if we were wearing "closed" headphones.  Because of the "semi-open" design of the 880s, we are still able to make comments to each other during the film, or carry on normal conversation, without having to remove our headphones or pause the film or CD -- just as we would if we weren't wearing headphones at all.Allow me to repeat myself: W-O-W. I absolutely LOVE these things!

worked great for me. this lightweight foldable headphone was bought to fly overseas. wanted something light weight over the ear that wouldn't take up much room or weight in luggage.  It has decent sound. make no mistake it is not a bose, but for movies on the plane it was fine. It was OK for 10 hours. I hate ear buds I didn't want to take my good bose because weight and afraid it would go missing somewhere in luggage handling thu out  the trip. I wish it has had a little caring bag but a zip lock worked.
Why I 5 star this item:  I heard a noise behind me and I turned--nothing there--I heard another sound, turned again, nothing.  Creepy.  As I continue watching my movie when, I realized what I heard were the background noises in the movie!  It was so darn real--it was 3D sound.  If it was supposed to be heard on the right side of you, behind you, or swings around to the other side, you heard the sound travel around you--that's how good this headphone is for $13 bulks (I just ordered another one).  They are not tight, no squeezing the brain between my ears giving me headaches--but if you bow your head the phones will move--I do not light tight headphones anyway, so the light tension on these works for me.  The sound quality is clear, sharp, balance; it delivers what your system produces.  There's no buzzy, no crispy bread squeeze noise.  The product is of standard decent quality.  I recommend buying some headphone-cover socks to protect the earphones from wear-tear.  The JVC model/item is light; I don't know how durable it is; I don't think they will stand up to hard abuse; I don't abuse my stuff so I hope the headphone will last.
I use these at work and on the airplane. I heard more details in the music than I do with more expensive Bluetooth wireless ear buds.
lo que no agrade es que se resbala por el cabello. de resto esta ok
The headband is extremely loose, poor quality. Very flimsy. Doesn't stay on my head. Sound is "tinny".
A REALLY GREAT HEADSET SUPER LIGHT THE BEST ONE I HAVE HAD THAT IS TRULY LIGHTWEIGHT THE ONLY FEATURE WHICH WOULD MAKE IT A PERFECT HEADSET IS IF IT HAD INLINE VOLUME CONTROL, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND...
I wear 2 hearing aids, so I needed earphones that would fit above my ears, not on them.  (My hearing aids are the behind-your-ear style.)  These work, while others were not "short' enough to sit in this position.  These work!  Thank you.
they didn‚Äôt work when they got here and they also wouldn‚Äôt stay on my head at all, they would just fall off right away. i‚Äôm so upset because i payed 17 dollars for them.
They work
This works for what I need them for.  It suits my purpose.
https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-Ultra-Portable/product-reviews/B08GKWXRF4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews
I've had these headphones for almost 6 months now and so far, no complaints. The noise cancellation is as close to perfect as you can realistically get. The battery life is absolutely insane; I can count on one hand the amount of times I've actually had to charge them. The design itself is also really sleek and they're very comfortable to wear. The sound itself is also very immersive and plenty loud yet still won't pierce your ears and damage your hearing even at full volume. Pls do not wear these when working out cus the the synthetic leather on the cups is not designed to withstand excessive moisture, especially from heavy sweating.  And with the XM5's out these are a bargain and perform every bit as well as the new models. I personally like the design of these much better than the XM5's since they also fold for easy storage whereas the new ones do not. Also the manufacturer threw in a free power bank as well. Although they gave me an energizer one instead of the anker one that was advertised but that's fine since it looks just as good and works just as well so that's not an issue at all. All in all great purchase can't wait to use these on a plane. Get them while you still can, cannot recommend these enough
Sound: good. Battery: good. Comfort: average.Bad: app and controls.The headphones won‚Äôt work without the app, and the app is useless aside from tracking our usage which I strongly dislike. The touchpad controls on the earcup is unpredictable and annoying: when the headphones are around the neck the slightest touch from the chin/cheeks will play/pause the sound.All in all, good sound but annoying, overwrought, gadget riddled product. Slightly disappointed.
I have had these for over a month now and I use these M-F at my job to help cancel out some noisy pipes as I work in a hospital basement and the steam pipes can be quit loud. It does not 100% cancel them out but they fade into the background with no music going and if I am playing ANY audio at all I cannot hear the pipes at all. Also the connect to two devices feature is super nifty and handy for switching between a youtube video on my laptop to watching a snapchat or tiktok sent by my friends on my phone. They are super lightweight without feeling cheap like the cheaper versions of sonys noise canceling headphones, and do not cause me a headache at all, I will say the ear cups hold a bit of heat so if you are going to use these for workouts just know they are not the most breathable earcups but that's because they are mean to isolate exterior noise and that typically means giving up the breathability.The ability to customize the passive listening and speak to pause  media features in the app is a huge plus, i have it focus on voices so i dont hear the ambient noise but if someone walks into my office i can hear them start to talk to me and if i start talking it will auto pause my music/ media and a double tap on the side will start it back up once im done with the conversationTWO THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE BUYING1- If you are having issues with it stuttering go into the mobile app and switch it to "prioratize stable connection" you will not notice a difference in the audio quality i swear,2- If using with a laptop like I am and you use a bluetooth mouse or anything that *might* cause some interference. Every once in a while my audio will go a bit choppy but as soon as I unplug the bluetooth adapter for my wireless mouse it stops. NOTE THIS IS A BLUETOOTH DEVICE ISSUE NOT JUST SONY. its because the bluetooth signals get a lil jumbled and can mess each other up. It does not happen all the time just intermittently
I didn't think it was possible to eliminate so much noise! Would be interesting to see if Sony can beat this model with even better noise cancellation!
I am so happy with this purchase. They are comfy to wear, light weight and the sound quality is fantastic.I am also very impressed with the battery life. I would most definitely recommend these!
These headphones work great with tele and video conferencing platforms. I wish I had purchased them during Prime day since the product was discounted significantly.  A bit pricey but worth it.
If I had read the Amazon reviews I probably wouldn't have bought it, namely the top review where complaints about critical things I need like BT pairing with a laptop and VOIP call quality being terrible would've put me off.That being said though I've had none of those issues! The headphones paired perfectly with my phone, and my laptop (simultaneously). Call quality was leagues better than my QC35's on both devices, pairing was effortless albeit a bit slow (took a few more seconds than I'm accustomed to) and I didn't have to play with weird input devices like the other reviewer mentioned. It just, worked.Call Quality:Normal calls, WhatsApp calls, video calls (phone) or VOIP (laptop) were all equally clear. No issues concerning choosing the correct mic in Windows or Teams. Even with my airconditioner on full blast right above my desk I was clear to other call participants who didn't even notice. I was mostly interested in this feature as I take a number of calls for work and they really delivered a smooth and painless experience.Music:Music quality was great, rich bass, and the noise cancelling was adaptable depending on the ambient noise you were experiencing at the time, rather than cranking it up to max and leaving it there. I enjoy music but it isn't my primary reason for getting the headset.BT Range:This was a sore point on my previous headset, but these kept a great connection despite being a room or two away through concrete walls. Allows me to pop to the kitchen during calls without dropping a connection or experiencing any audio quality issues. It remained clear at all times.Fit and Finish:They feel luxurious, the outer coating is nice and soft but more importantly the headset feels light so wearing them for hours while at work in between calls without feeling the need to remove them is easy (although a small note on this later*).Nothing in life is perfect so here are the negatives:The haptic controls, they work, kinda. The volume up and down is fine, but double tapping to answer or pause is a bit "hit-and-miss". It does eventually get it if you keep trying and sometimes it gets it immediately but it isn't consistent.The earcups aren't terribly deep so if you have bigger ears or they are more pronounced you will be up against the inner cup which means wearing them for hours on end may end up being irritating. *They also get quite warm but not unbearable - in reference to wearing them for a few hours.Overall very happy I got them on sale ($255 without import duties) with the power bank, it was an extremely worthwhile purchase and one I would recommend to others.
A good nights sleep
I have extreme noise sensitivity and fairly intense anxiety and at the end of my day, I need something that can just allow my brain not to have to process noise and these headphones have exceeded my expectations. The noise cancelling just right for me. Some people may not think it is the best, but most noise cancelling headphones just make me feel like cotton is being shoved in my ear and vibrated, so these are very nice. The ability to choose sound cancelling or ambient noise at different levels is delightful and allows for a variety of sound levels depending on your mood/what you are doing.The sound quality is very good. You also have the ability through the app to change sound equalization based on if you are listening to a show or listening to music, which is a very convenient feature.The battery charged very fast and I've been wearing them for 4 hours now and the battery hasn't dropped from 100%. The swipe gestures are very easy to follow and they are neither too sensitive or under sensitive. When connected to my phone, all the swipe gestures work, however when connected to my TV, the play/pause doesn't function, but that may be due to the fact that my apps stream through an Xbox and it may not be compatible, so I'm not going to dock any stars for it.The headphones themselves are also very comfortable. The ear cups are just big enough and I have fairly big ear for a woman of my size. The headband is sufficiently padded as are the ear cups. The weight of the headphones is also acceptable very light, which is great for long wear. So far my head feels slightly sore, but I wear headphones for my work, so the spot is sensitive to begin with, so again, no stars off.All and all, I would highly recommend these for anyone who wants a very high quality set of headphones that are easy to use, sturdy, and exactly as advertised.
I did not find the noise canceling feature to be the way it was advertised. However,  it's a good product tho felt little expensive.

UPDATE JAN 2022.Sadly, I really would like to luv this headphones, but this is not the outcome of my experience.  After light use, always at home I got to say that my personal experience has not been a bed of roses.PROS: Sound quality still really good.  The case is great to keep them out of dust, mine still might look as new but will tell more after.  Battery still lasting long.CONS: it broke... still playing music but the pad on top start falling a part (I add an image). The presure on your head is still to much so I end with headaches or pain in skull behind my ears.  Bluetooth connection is ok but when I am away like 7 or 8 mts start having problems. Earpads still stiff and not very comfortable. I really wish I found a way to exchange those, but I haven't been lucky to find a video or description how to dismantle those pads from this particular headphones; Philips do not give any kind of support on that respect so bad point for that company. Cable to listen in high quality is flat and that is ok, but the connector is small so the cable bends to close and probably will be broken very soon (I think they could design something better)In general I CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS PAIR OF HEADPHONES AND I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER PAIR IN THE FUTURE.  Even the sound quality is really good :-(.  I read from a guy who can¬°t hear BASS on this, well,I disagree but probably he like those headphones with MegaBass systems which is not my personal preference.  Do not forget to use your equalizer to tune to your taste.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Perfectly packaged.  It is awesome to get this beautiful (THEY ARE REALLY GOOD LOOKING) headphones with the hard case to protect them and for travel. People has been complaining about noise cancellation but mine works perfect... the only thing I do not like much is between songs I can listen little hiss from it so I rather to use it off but when are ON really blocks all noise from the street which is the way should work. So when is rush hour I turn ON and peace came to my ears...I like to listen many music genera, from barroque, to Glam or some Heavey metal, blues, jazz, rock and people critizing headphones for bass etc.. but in general you have to tune for each genera your equalizer, but is not only for each genera but also for each pair of different headphones or speakers you are going to use.  For most people that is not an issue so is a personal preference.SOUND  of this Philips is good.I try talking on the phone, and people said that they hear me like I was in a bucket or something like that... but to me their voices are crystal clear, but looks like my voice sound different but I did not experience that they do not understand me clear so I think works fine.Construction, materials etc... are as good as BOSE or SONY, probably this ones are more confortable to me and this ones fit better to me, earpads are super soft!!!! really confortable.  The head pressure is little tight, not very disconfortable but makes me feel the pair of headphones on my head all the time.CONTROLS, I read some reviews about people having issues with their controls, well... READ THE MANUAL, is really easy and clear and works perfect as described by Philips.  I do not use google assitant, mainly because you just open your mic to let google hear you whatever they can  thru the mic (Probably they already doing it LOL).Another thing... Volume. Headphones have their own volume scale which is differnt from the source (phone, MAC or whatever u are using) so keep that in mind, try to protect your ears not listeing to high and learn to listen in lower mid volume so your ears need to be train for detailes (Just a personal sugestion).  So If you want high volume, pump up the volume on source and headphones.I will try to update my review after the summer to see how battery last, if starts to breaking apart or moving parts start making noise or something like that.  I hope this review helps you to decide to get this ones or not.Totally recomended, I got a great price, otherway I would finished buying some chinese cheap headphones.Bluethooth connection has been super relieble and can be around 10m (30ft) away from source in dofferent rooms.WOW, Bach start... got to listen this. Have a great day enjoy your music.**************************************UPDATE AFER A MONTH OF USE:**************************************Well, I wish I would like to fall in love of this headphones, but I am glad I had a chance to update my review about them.  After a month of daily use I got my list and why I decide to reduce to a 4 stars my review.PROS: Battery is amazing, I only chaged once few days ago and the continue playing, will see how long the battery really last, then what is my question... Do I have to buy a new pair? Will Philips be kind to replace the battery?Sound still really good.Design is nice and most of the materials used are great.Connection has been tip top, no issues about it.I love that they came with the case, is really cool to have one with this quality.When I use with cable is also really good, and I do not hear the cable sound like on those small headphones that came with your phone.CONS: The only but very important cons I found were the earpads, mine were really confortable the first week, after that I need to constant change position of the headphones to avoid pain in my ears or my head which is no good, probably I shoud give 3 stars only but sound is really good.  I do not know if I can replace those pads for different kind.The left and the right side have different shapes, left one has some bulky points on foam and are not cushing that well anymore.Material of pads is really soft, but because are leather or PU (fake leather) make them hot after long periods, but I live in a cold city so that is not a mayor concern.I don't know if pads are made of memory foam but maybe I might need different kind, probably for someone else works that is why I only take one star only, is a personal experience.If any one know how to change those pads I appreciate your comments and help.The pressure from the headphones itself is strong, so probably if you consider that you have a big head, I recomend avoid them, brand new are so soft but after days of using you will notice.  I would like to give a second chance if I can change the PADS maybe that helps in my experience using this beautiful headphones.
Pros would be that it does provide some noise cancellation, but that is to be expected with any set of over-the-ear closed-back headphones. They fit comfortably (thus far), and the sound is pretty nice for the price. A good balanced sound, with enough bass, etc.The 30-hour battery life is a great claim, we will have to see if it lives up to it before I can give a rating on that, since I just bought it.  But that would explain the 2-hour charging time.Cons would be- it came with an extremely short charging cable- less than 2 inches long?  Fortunately I had a normal length charging cable with exactly the same end and a charger, so it wasn‚Äôt a big issue.Another potential con is the swiveling hinges on the ear pieces- this seems like a weak point in the construction, and after owning them for a long period of time, I can see them falling apart at these particular points. I know I‚Äôve owned enough bluetooth headphones that the joints where they either fold or swivel are ALWAYS the weakest points in the construction- and I know I have replaced two units that were still working great as far as the electronics- pairing, connecting, playing great sound, etc- because the joints fell apart and I couldn‚Äôt physically wear them anymore.I hope this is not the case with these phones, because I like how they look, and how they sound, and I have bought a hardshell case to carry them in to prevent unnecessary wear and tear from dropping them, spilling something on them, etc, etc.I have owned other Philips products, including a Professional Series home theatre amp that I‚Äôve had for ten plus years which still puts out great sound- and I‚Äôm hoping my confidence in the brand will not be misplaced.
The sound quality of these headphones is solid--- crisp mids and defined bass, not too tinny highs. The controls are very intuitive and easy to get used to, and they're comfortable to wear. I really appreciate the overall design, which is minimalist and simple with no shiny bits or excessive branding. A lot of headphones in this price range try really hard to look futuristic or "industrial", which often just makes them look tacky and less comfortable to wear. I like that these are just simple and utilitarian. The one gripe I have is that the construction doesn't feel especially solid--- not cheap by any means, just rather plasticky. However, I would still recommend this to anyone as a solid pair of headphones on a budget.
Being a crazy avid user of over ear headphones i've used many of the top spec products out there before, I had both the Sony XM3 and the Bose QC 35II and they were amazing. In need of a new replacement for my worn out QC35IIs I wanted to try something new but not break the bank. That's where I literally stumbled across these as they looked really similar at first glance to my XM3's. I never heard of Philips making noise cancelling headphones before and through a quick youtube search it seems like no mainstream youtuber reviewed these pairs of headphones either. I tried my luck and decided to give these a go and im definitely pleased given its price. Ill go over its pros and cons below and since im no audiophile knowing what's the right mix of highs and lows I will give my unprofessional opinion. Note that I got these for under 100$ because of a holiday sale. Take that in mind when you read the review and for the price you currently have.PROS:~ Great battery life, advertised as 30 hours and I got around 25-27 hours on mid-high volume.~ Quality on the band and the ear pieces are great. Didn't notice any creaking of the plastic or flexing that caused any housing to pop out.~ Fairly comfortable. The ear cup design and cutout definitely mirrors the XM3's, while these are not as good as the QC35IIs (which imo are industry leading in comfort), I would say they are actually slightly better than the XM3's. I felt the XM3's were more stuffy on my ear and the clamping pressure of the band made it uncomfortable to wear after 4-5 hours. I've been wearing these Philips for 6-7 hours at a time and I didn't really notice any major discomfort. Of course, each person's head shape is different and comfort varies upon the individual.~ For those who love bass, I think these were amazing, even slightly overpowering for me. They are comparable to the XM3's.~ sound quality is great, it sounds just like the industry leading XM3's and better than the QC35II's. I have been using my Airpods pro a lot and these are miles better in sound quality.~ noise cancellation works well for its price range.~ carrying pouch it comes with is well made and compact enough to slide in your backpack.CONS:~ the ambient sound feature is absolutely horrible on these headphones. For those who don't know ambient it lets you hear your surroundings better without you needing to take of your headphones. Even with these on I can't really hear anything outside. For reference, my AirPods pro ambient feature uses the microphones to enhance the outside noise and it makes it feel like you're not wearing earphones at all. These Philips do not do that at all.~ the microphones on these headphones are not great. I would not recommend using these when calling.~ the OK google tap function can get very annoying. every time I accidentally brush across the ear cup I activate the OK google function. Furthermore, I couldn't find a way to activate siri instead of google. Other brands at this price point offer this feature.~ Touch controls to control volume were very difficult at first to get use to. You need to do more of a tap than a swipe. But once you master this, then the volume controls work great.~ on my second picture, you can see that the ring of plastic changes to a more piano black which picks up scratches and fingerprints like crazy. I wish they used a consistent design throughout the ear cup.Overall, I would say at my purchase price these were definitely a bargain for its quality. While it's not as amazing with fancy features as the top Sony and Bose headphones, I received these at a fraction of their price. If you see a sale of these for under 100$ I would go for it for sure!
I was looking for a pair of headphones and I wanted something lower priced to start out since I normally stick to my airpods. Overall these are pretty comfortable, I have a small head so they do slip around a little but they cover my ears rather than sitting on ear uncomfortably. Having an actual pair of headphones is great and the sound is ten times better than my airpods, however, the sound leakage is very bad. If I take them off and push them off to the side, even when the volume is very low I can still hear this music. This isn't great especially since I bought them to wear around campus. So these certainly won't be replacing my airpods, but they're a good addition.
Got this for my birthday! This is my first time getting an over ear headphone also I‚Äôm a broke college student so I didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money but I loved the aesthetic of the Sony ones. So I thought these looked so similar and I love these. Also you have to press that button for 3 seconds. I just got them so I hope they don‚Äôt stop working after a week üò≠
Don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs vain but a big deciding factor on headphones for me was aesthetic, and I love the way these look! They sound great and the battery lasts forever. My only complaint is the quiet-est setting isn‚Äôt that quiet but it‚Äôs not a huge deal.
Highs:- Excellent noise canceling performance- Really nice fit and finish, comfortable to wear- Excellent build quality and durability (hinges seem very sturdy)- Easy to use, with very functional touch control- Good design, not intrusive or overly flashy (sophisticated in my eyes)- Easy to connect and Google Assistant functions are great (i am using a Pixel 3A XL)- Updated firmware (auto prompted me this) upon connecting the first time- Versatile folding positions- Awareness mode (so I can be aware of the surrounding without having to take these off)- Super fast charging timesLows:- Not the lightest but understandable with the quality of materials they are using- MicroUSB and not USB-C- Power button sometimes take a bit longer to shut off (have to hold down more than 3 seconds)- 2.5mm jack in instead of 3.5mm- Not the most bass heavy (this is both a good and a bad, depending on taste)Summary:These are surprisingly a great pair of ANC headphones that performs just as well as the Sony WH-1000XM3, the gold standard in ANC headphones, while costing almost $100 less than the Sony! It isn't as functional when it comes to tuning its audio profiles but in terms of everyday usability and its ANC performance, it gets a 9/10 from me.Build quality is amazing for a sub $200 headphone, the leather, memory foam, hinges, and even the paint on the earcups are textured perfectly so that these should last a good few years of heavy usage with no worries.Audio quality is above average but it does lack the smartphone software that allows you to adjust the EQ and such on the headphones but I think this can be compensated by adjusting the EQ on the music player you are using. I tried playing some FLAC on a non-amplified line using the 3.5mm to 2.5mm cable that is included, it does a great job of delivering clear highs and mids without muddles from the bass. It definitely excels at the trebles, an indication that this is great for clear conversations too. And yes, calls are extremely clear when I use this for regular phone and VOIP conversations on my phone.Connecting to the phone is easy once it is paired, turning it on does the job automatically. Pairing is easy too, hallmarks of a good BT 5.0 implementation. It even show a picture of the PH805 on my phone after I click on its name in the Bluetooth devices.There are 3 excellent party tricks that makes this an excellent steal at $180 or so.1. The 3 ways that it folds: flat fold, curl fold, and flat and curl fold (where it fits in the pouch)2. Awareness mode turns down the music and broadcasts the environmental noise so that you hear whats around you easily and can carry a conversation with the person in front of you while wearing it, which is quite fun/funny but useful on commutes3. Google Assistant: I actually started looking at my phone less and less now that I own this pair of headphones. Having Google Assistant able to read back any text messages, even messages in Line app because that function is enabled when wearing this headphone means that I can focus more on work and not get distracted by the many other things going on on my phone! And having the touch control on the earcup, without any additional markings, is a great design in nature.4th bonus party trick: its touch control is really useful for turning up and down the volume, no more trying to find the volume rocker or buttons, just swipe at the right ear-cup and it adjusts the volume, although slowly.
Really good sound and build quality for the $100 plus price point  Loved the sound. ANC was great. They fit snug. The rest of the build quality was solid. They looked and fit great too. Another plus is the hard shell case that they come in. I would have loved to use this for travel.But I returned these day one. Here are my reasons. No app from Philips. Just used the built in Bluetooth which relies on Google Assistant (Android). The touch control gets stuck between failing to pause/play and launching the very annoying Google assistant. Touch failed to work well even after disabling Google Assistant. Given I did not feel I could even pause playback reliably, this was a deal breaker for $150 headphones.Minor complaints: Had an issue where the manual control button felt like it could break in a few weeks of use. The fake leather made my ears uncomfortably hot after twenty minutes or so. No USB-C butt instead micro USB. Weird 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm jack. Cheap cable included for both the power and audio jack. Microphone recorded my voice very sub par compared to higher end headphones.
They're almost perfect headphones, I just wish they let me connect the mic through the aux cable and they didn't block the music for so long to tell me when I switch modes

I use these for work. The sound quality is good and the noise cancelation is excellent. They are comfortable, though after an hour or two, my ears need a breather. The things I wish were different are the tangling cord and somehow the dial on the ear piece often lowers the sound to minimum volume between calls. I have to remember to manually increase the volume before answering or making the next call to avoid having to adjust it with the client on the phone.
Tie up or hang up lose wireing as the spliter is a extra 5ish foot on top of the headsets wire.. not at all tough plastic joints are flimsy and if you have hair longer then few Centimeters it's gonna get pulled but of you can look past those downfall it has beautiful sound great noise canceling easy mute light weight works will with phones to and can be worn once you find a comfortable spot all day.... Just be aware of the downfalls
I got these for my wife, but I tried them out, too. Keep in mind that they are not meant to compete with serious audiophile headphones, but in the $0-$100 range, they are top-notch. I have a pair of AT M40s and she has open-backed AKG K240s. These have a lot more bass and isolation than the open backs, but that's to be expected. I would put them on par with the AudioTechnicas. They have good clarity and are very comfortable to wear for long periods. Music is pleasant and offers the entire range of frequencies. I've listened to my wife talk through the mic and it is much, much better than most headphone mics, even beating much more expensive ones. The mic is clean and clear, and while it won't compete with a studio mic, would be perfectly acceptable for a live stream, or at the least, not annoying your friends in chat. We've noticed that the mic is very sensitive. If I try to listen to something on my phone while my wife is playing with her sister, and my phone is turned way down to the point I can barely hear it and is about 4 feet from her mic, her sister will say she can hear it. So I guess don't expect a directional mic if you have room noise.
Bought these as a quick replacement not expecting much but they are pretty decent for the price, sound range is impressive although the treble is a little harsh, great for gaming tho theyre comfortable enough to wear for a long time and make a good seal around the ear. mic quality is lacking somewhat.
Overall sound quality is pretty good and a big step up from my old headphones. Obviously, more expensive headphones could sound better, but at this price point, the Quantum 200s definitely deliver. These headphones are a huge step up from the old Sony studio headphones I was using before that had sound that was too flat for gaming. These headphones have really taken the fun up a notch, completely immersing me during thunderous gunfights, while also allowing me to pinpoint the softest of footsteps nearby. Despite not having active noise cancelation like some of the higher tier Quantums, these headphones are still extremely isolating, and drown out most exterior noise when sound is coming through. The flip up/down to mute and unmute the mic has also been great for multiplayer, though the foam windscreen comes off occasionally.---------------------Update: 2 years later the right ear speaker is having issues. It only produces sound if the volume knob is set to to a super specific level; otherwise it cuts out. The left ear speaker is fine. Probably a wiring issue, but disappointing since I was pretty gentle with the headphones and never even traveled with them. Anyway, overall value has definitely dropped, so updating my stars from 5 to 3. I enjoyed these headphones while they lasted, and maybe others will last a lot longer, but seeing as they had a 1-year warranty, I don't think I have any options left.
Terrible for gaming. I had a less expensive JBL headphone (not even meant for gaming) that was better than this. Cord is way too long, and the microphone feedback through my party is horrid. Adjusted mic monitoring but still need to lower the volume to a point where it‚Äôs uncomfortable to even play.
Easily in the top Headphones at and above this price range. Feels well built with attention to detail in design. Lightweight and extremely comfortable even if you wear glasses, which i do. The surround sound that JBL has created on their own is really amazing. I was able to orient myself with my eyes closed and just using game sounds. I tested them on Far Cry 5, Modern Warfare, and Hunt Showdown. Each of these games has a well crafted sound design perfect to showcase what these headphones can do and they DEFINITELY IMPRESS. These cans packing 50mm drivers do an amazing job of balancing everything from low lows to sharp highs. The flip up Mic allows me to easily mute myself in game and the volume control on the left ear is handy as well. The cord has a decent length but not so long that its a mess and it naturally stays untangledOverall definitely 5 stars, love these headphones, definitely better than others in the same price range
Sound quality is great clear and crisp, I love the mic up to mute feature. The only glaring issue is the cord is ridiculously short if your not using the splitter. I believe it less than three feet possibly only two and a half.
These headphones did exactly what they said they were going to do and a little more. I have been using them for a while and they are not bad at all honestly perfect for what I use them for.
Loved the sound quality from the headphones. However, the mic picked up a lot of that sound so friends heard an echo.

These are pretty darn wonderful, but you should know, this is my first upgrade from earbud style headphones and that is my only point of comparison. But if you are tiptoeing into the more expensive world of fancier headphones to get your audio thrills like me, I can say that I am super happy with this investment.My setup: I paired these headphones with DragonFly Cobalt DAC, Amazon Music Hi Def streaming, iPhone to USB camera adapter. The first night I had these, I couldn't stop listening to music, because it was like I was hearing my favorite albums for the first time again. Constant goosebumps and visceral sensations from just being able to hear more in the music and with a stronger sense of space and left/right channel movement. The improvement in my listening experience is pretty astounding. I am not exaggerating to say at one point, listening to Jacob Collier, I heard some glorious new pretty that made me think I was feeling a tear welling up in my eye!I ordered this pair specifically because the price was greatly reduced on a pair of  headphones listed as "used, like new", which arrived with a "refurbished" sticker on the box.  The excellent deal pretty much was the decision maker on my model choice and alleviated some of the financial pain of also needing to invest in a headphone DAC/Amp + iPhone adapter to make this step up in my listening experience. I agree that the "like new" assessment was accurate. I see no signs of wear or any signs that these are not just new headphones. My only complaint is that they smell like they've been sprayed with some kind of household deodorizer (I won't mention brand names, but you find it in the cleaning aisle, not in the perfume aisle - so it's not someone's personal fragrance left behind on the soft materials). It's pretty much the exact same smell that all of amazon's blue and white bubble plastic shipping bags smell like. I don't know where the fragrance fairies are in this process -at sennheiser refurbishing?, at the shipping warehouses? in my local delivery trucks?  but I spent my first hour listening with utmost joy to my music while also fighting off an asthma attack from the fragrance. That's how good these sound, I was willing to endure asthma to keep listening, but really, can the fragrance fairies stop this business? You might literally kill someone. For what I saved on these headphones though, I'm willing to air them out for a few weeks. And other than the asthma, they are otherwise very comfortable to wear , even after a day of wearing a mask that rubs the back of my ears raw. I've felt teddy bears less soft than these ear cushions. They're pretty sweet.If you are like me and new to this process, I do want to confirm that open back headphones are truly audible to those around you, even at "save your hearing" volumes. So these are definitely "at home" headphones. Since I was aiming to give myself a tool for inducing happy-brain sensations and deep relaxation after a stressful workday, these suit my needs perfectly. My intention was to use these someplace quiet and private. If you need something for travel, or to drown out outside noises, these aren't going to be well matched to that need. If you want a music goosebumps and can match these with a Hi-Def music source and headphone amp/DAC, then these should make you very happy.
I have a pair of Sennheiser HD438's, but I hadn't used them much in the recent years. I was more into TWS earbuds and then transitioned to wired IEM's. I recently dug out my old Sennie's for a change and really appreciated the forgotten comfort and sound signature.  So, I decided to research today's headphones. The HD 599 SE was in the right price bracket (I've spent way too much already, according to my wife!!) and the reviews gave it high marks for soundstage, comfort, sound signature and open-back bass. I knew Sennheiser was durable. My HD438's are still in excellent condition after 11 or 12 years.  The SE traditional coloring is much better suited to my taste than the HD 599..DESIGN & BUILD:The Industrial Stylist at Sennheiser must have a really tedious job.  I was surprised how similar my 11-year-old HD 438 is to the HD599.  No major styling change there in all that time!  At least that shiny spoke pattern, which reminds me of my truck wheels, is gone!  The headphones are equally comfortable, with a touch more pressure on the HD599.  My glasses are not forced onto my head though and I can wear these for hours.  The oval earcups are quite large vertically, like the HD 438, and fit my big ears perfectly to be truly ‚Äòover-the-ear‚Äô ‚Äòphones.  I have room to spare, but not much!.While these headphones are made of plastic, they are very strong and you‚Äôll struggle to break them.  You can twist and spread these around and not crack anything..I‚Äôm not a fan of the dedicated 2.5mm (?) twist-lock connector into the headphone, but at least there are aftermarket replacements available.  I have no idea why the adapter on the longer cable is a large female to small male and the large male 6.35mm connector is on the cable.  The cable should be 3.5mm and the adapter should enlarge the connector.  With the adapter on, the cable end is just too honking big!.My only criticism would be the headband adjustment.  I liked the SHP 9500 with its strong detent and numbering system.  I find the headband can go out of adjustment too easily handling the headphones and I have to judge the gap in the headband visually for my best fit..SOUNDSTAGE & IMAGING:When I got the HD 599 SE, I plugged them straight into my phone and was totally blown away.  The frequency curve is essentially neutral with a hint of coloration.  The bass rolls off below 40Hz but the treble stays strong right up to the 20kHz limit.  The mids are slightly cool but are certainly not ‚Äòrecessed‚Äô.I felt like‚Ä¶- I was in a room with the musicians.  The reproduction was totally natural.- The bass was really solid, surprisingly so for an open-back headphone.  Maybe not bass head worthy, but punchy, crisp, and realistic.- The treble was clear, detailed and ‚ÄòSennheiser smooth‚Äô.  I really liked my Momentum TW2 earbud sound signature, but as buds go, they are dated (app and ANC) compared with other brands and I ended up returning them. ‚òπ‚ÄòHold me now‚Äô by the Thompson twins, ‚ÄòHoney and the Bee‚Äô by Owl City, and ‚ÄòAppetite‚Äô by Prefab Sprout can be quite harsh, even sibilant, at the upper end on all my IEM's and some of my TWS buds. I like a bright sound, but not sibilant and grainy. The HD 599 SE was so natural sounding and just‚Ä¶ gorgeous.- The soundstage is what I've been seeking and missing with closed back and in-ears.  Hotel California - Live on MTV 1994 by the Eagles sounds amazing. That punch at 32s is awesome. ‚ÄòStrive‚Äô by Amber Rubarth, ‚ÄòKilling me softly‚Ä¶‚Äô by Roberta Flack, 'Unearthed - Orchestral version' by Wildpath, and ‚ÄòYour Grace is enough ‚Äì Live‚Äô by Matt Maher are just sublime.  There‚Äôs both width and height with correctly mixed tracks.  Try listening to ‚ÄúBest 8D song EVER with headphones 2021 ‚Äì HD‚Äù on YT.  Awesome!- Imaging is also superb and it‚Äôs easy to pick out the location of instruments.  ‚ÄòBuck Dance‚Äô by Dick Schory‚Äôs New Percussion Ensemble has your senses tracking all over the stage!.I‚Äôd not used open back headphones before trying the SHP 9500 and I actually liked the feel and openness, compared with closed-back.  However, the SHP 9500 did not have the sound staging I was after.  The HD 599 SE certainly does.Of course, you need to use these in a quiet room to save your ears.  With the 106dB sensitivity and 50 Ohm impedance, I do have to use 70 to 80% volume directly connected to my phone, compared with 40% on my IEM‚Äôs.  Still plenty loud enough for me, but you may not agree.  Please take care of your hearing though!.I have a collection of Earbud Test Tracks, which I use to assess my earphones‚Ä¶.https://music.amazon.com/user-playlists/6c1a03929ed947ab82cc33db24d7c001sune?ref=dm_sh_c7f9-3dba-7009-a4cd-8323a.I usually use a Qudelix 5K DAC/AMP.  I loaded Oratory1990‚Äôs HD 599 PEQ and with the HD 599 connected, I noticed that it cleaned up the lower/mid bass just a tad.  On some tracks, the bass can get a little muddy. I felt that a little more treble was needed and slightly less bass though to suit my taste.  So, I adjusted the PEQ and I now have my final settings (see photo)..CONCLUSION:For a consumer-friendly price, you are truly entering Audiophile territory with the HD 599.  I have no reticence in stating that.When the HD 599 go on sale, they are an absolute must-have.  I bought these for the current price of $150.  I still think that‚Äôs a steal!The HD 599 SE are now my go-to for serious listening late at night and I think they could be yours also!
Me likey:+ Sound quality is great+ Very comfortable+ Not gaudy like other sets+ Super reliableMe no likey:- They‚Äôre very priceyWireless seems like the way to go these days, and maybe it is. But I‚Äôm in the position where I don‚Äôt have to have a wireless set so, if I don‚Äôt need it, I‚Äôll go with the reliability of wired phones any day.These Sennheisers sound terrific and they work as advertised. I own two sets and never had to worry about them working. No interference whatsoever, and they‚Äôre super comfortable to wear. I can wear these for hours on end without discomfort. What‚Äôs more, they‚Äôre narrow at the ear pieces, so I don‚Äôt look like an alien or robot while wearing them.These headphones come at a price; a hefty one. At the time of this writing, the price has been reduced, but I paid $200 a piece for my sets. Sure, they‚Äôre comfortable and they sound great, but that‚Äôs still a hefty chunk of change. Only consider paying for these if you‚Äôre serious about your audio.
Edit:In spite of wonderful sound and very comfortable ear cups, I returned these to Amazon.I am an engineer and therefore really picky about design and I hope this saves somebody a bit of research.I just couldn't live with the head band of these.  It almost defies understanding that a company as fantastic as Senheisser would release a headband design like this.  I will say again, that the sound and ear cup comfort of the 599 is fantastic.  But they create a hot spot on top of the head where the head band with modest foam point loads the top of the head.  No reason for it.  Seinnheiser even understands this dynamic and sell both less expensive like the HD-559 and the more upscale HD 650 headphones with a much more padded and headband with a void at the top of the head which could cause irritation.If you guys and girls want to take the dive, look into the Seinheisser HD-6xx which is a knock off of the venerable HD-650 which is twice the price of the 599. These headphones are magic.  Go out on youtube and watch some reviews.  Best $200 headphone on the market.  Just scored an open box purchase in new condition and these are even better in both sound and comfort to the 599.  I had NO complaints about the sound quality of the 599 but I need complete comfort.  Hope this helps and happy listening.I don't write a lot of reviews but I come from the world of tech and appreciate all genres of music.  I recommend everybody interested in the HD 599 to go to youtube and watch some reviews which will be in more depth than mine.I am returning to earphone listening after many years.  I built a new AMD CPU based computer which btw I love without a dedicated GPU but with Asrock on board sound which drives these headphones beautifully.  Because of their low impedance, not essential to drive them through a dedicated amp.Comfort:Comfort for me for overall listening is ESSENTIAL.  It is largely why I bought these.  I have largish ears and where a large hat...not a small guy but not a huge guy either.  I struggle with the comfort of many headphones.  Not these. They are the best. Sennheiser gets it.  Other companies not so much.Ear pocket are very large to completely cover my largish ears and my ears though not tea cups stick out a bit...not excessive but require deep and large ear cup openings.  These deliver.What isn't understood about earphone design many times is...its a balance of clamping force to the head that determines headband pressure.  Higher the clamping force, the less the head band pressure because lateral force negates vertical fall of the headphones.  Many headphones with drivers and fidelity this size are heavy.  These weigh 250 grams and are light.  Therefore they don't require big clamping...rated only at .71 lbs mean clamping...no doubt head width specific..  In summary, because of low weight they don't dig in up top of the head even with low clamping pressure.  Genius design and I am a design guy so I appreciate it.Sound:Wonderful.  I am not formally a senior...a very active senior and listen to classic rock to some even hip hop...very little, to opera and classical music.  I like it all from Mo town to some jazz to mostly classic rock which I grew up...the best music of all time. :-)  These headphones deliver.  Listen to the reviews.  They aren't flat...slightly embellished.  An audiophile headphone with a bit of lowest and highs added.  What the absolutely non purist wants in a headphone.  Very very slight embellishment...almost not.  I don't like too much bass but love to hear it.  My aging ears don't hear the highs like they once did.  I can hear the highs with these.  If I EQ them, I can tune them precisely how I like them.They sound magnificient.  Btw, they are open headphones and not meant to keep all the sound within.  That is design intent and what better listening headphones are.  On an airplane, pick a pair of Senn closed headphones.Looks:Looks matter.  I am a design guy.  Shape, texture and appearance affects perception of the product.  5 out of 5.  Perfect.  I couldn't design them better.  Arguably a 'hint' of retro.  Not as retro at the 598.  If only the 598 existed, I would get those but these are aesthetically more modern and better IMO.  The color is a bit unique.  You maybe tired of everything black like me.  These are a bit different and absolutely beautiful.I have owned other high end headphones from other companies. These are my favorite.  I only have had them for a couple of days. Even in the time I have owned them they have burned in and will burn in much more in the next 200 hrs of listening.My advice.  If you like, try everything but own these.Happy listening everybody.  Surf youtube for your favorite music.  Some brilliant young artists out there.
I used to be a budding audiophile, learned a lot about sound, music, and the art of equipment. Was a great time in my life, but damn expensive, lol, so that was that. Anyway, I upgraded from cheap earbuds to something more dynamic, and the Sennheiser HD 599 SE gave me that for a fair price. First music I went to was Faure's Requiem (DG), one of my favorites and covers plenty of range and it was.. Beautiful. Next I went for the epic experience of LOTR, Fellowship; and it was exciting to say the least. All the detail was there, I even heard things I don't recall hearing before, the lows were great, firm and punchy, big and smooth where needed. It had no problem bringing everything to life, so I am plenty satisfied with these. Audiophile or not, these are keepers and I will enjoy every minute of them.
So this year I really wanted to try open back headphones, it was a new world I found out about.  I have bluetooth aukey and anker earbuds, Sony XB900N, HyperX Cloud PS4 (same as pc,xbox versions), and other wired earbuds.  A big plus is I can hear my surroundings with open-back.  This fall I did research, and learned so much about audio that I didn't care for before, but now fascinated.  I'm still not doing the amp thing.  SO I hope this review helps someone.My ultimate two choices came down to Sennheiser HD599se and Philips X2HR.  These two are so opposite when it comes to available information on the web.  Tons of X2HR forums, reviews, videos, etc., and HD599se not so much.  I wanted an open back headphone, for primarily games, and secondary music and movies.I almost decided to keep both headphones because it was so hard to choose.  Here are the differences first:- X2HR too heavy for me. I thought it wouldn't matter.  Very comfy but gets heavy soon after and too noticeable.- X2HR definitely a boomier bass.  Think deep rich smooth.- HD599se, super comfy, probably my most comfy headphone.  Ears don't get hot or sweaty like my Sony ANC headphones.  Can wear for hours which others I kind of need to take breaks.The first headphone I opened was X2HR.  First song was a Paul Taylor's Push to Start.  I almost cried, I don't think I've experienced a wide sound stage before.  Deep bass and open audio experience like no other.  It was like listening to song you knew but in a different way.  Everything sounded great.  Then I listened to more Paul Taylor, then Tobu, Axero, etc.  Yeah there's awesome bass.Then I couldn't contain myself I had to try the HD599se.  First I was underwhelmed.  Not wide, actually felt almost like closed back headphones.  But I was surprised to hear bass, I was worried it would be non-existent.  There was bass, but not as much as X2HR.  Then I tried both on my PS4 controller.  Both can were loud enough so no issues here.Two days later I tried them again, but put on the HD599se first and listened.  They were actually really good, not as bad as I remembered.  Then I put on X2HR.  Now I noticed the differences clearer.  In Jazz, the sax was so much more clearer and cleaner.  Guitars sounds beautiful.  So much more balanced, not neutral, but everything is presented well.  X2HR, bass does cloud the instruments, as its more pronounced I feel.Ultimately, after listening to more music from tobu, axero, gramatik, jack johnson, nora jones, paul taylor, haywyre, etc., and playing ps4, I really wanted to keep both for different purpose.  But in the end I chose one because I knew I'd only use one most of the time.  Here's why I chose the Sennheiser HD599se:- Audio is very balanced, and easy to listen to most genres.  I like the bass doesn't overwhelm everything.  Everything is pretty much at the same level.  The instruments sounds much clearer.  Its like if the artist wants more bass in the song, you'll definitely notice it.  Its seems more a match for what the artist probably wanted you to hear.- I don't know if burn-in happened, or what exactly that is, but over time I feel like the bass and audio quality of HD599se got significantly better.  Or maybe its that it sounds better on my PC than phone, and that's when I notice it.- Hip hop, jazz, blues, etc was a pleasure.  Only edm sounded better on X2hr to me.- Gaming was much more enjoyable on HD599se. In FPS like call of duty, I could hear my surroundings better and anticipate people around me.  In sports games, I felt like crowd noise was overwhelming on X2hr, such as FIFA.- Super comfortable and light.- I spend alot of time already listening to music on the HD599se because its really good.  I appreciate these more and more as I listen to music.  I'm not analyzing, just listening and doing my thing.In closing, I wish I could keep both.  But won't.  I wish Sennheiser had a little more bass, but its enough.  You will hear the boom, bass hum, the usual, but just not as much or rich as X2HR.  I wish HD599se had wider soundstage, which the X2hr had.  Really like that openness... alot.  If you like lots of bass and don't mind to sacrifice some of the audio of the instruments such as sax, piano, guitar, and ok with heavier headphone, then X2HR is amazing.  I went back and forth so much between the two, and was hard to pick.  I had to really listen alot.  In the end I'm really happy with my decision and awesome black friday price. Maybe next year we'll see what options are available in the market.
I bought these headphones 3 years ago as a replacement in a line of about 10 previous headphones, between regular $25 pairs that get the job done to $300 beats. And even now, I can't seem to find a reason to "upgrade". These have some of the best quality sounds of any pair of headphones I've ever owned, even coming close to my old overpriced beats. The noise leakage is a bit much, but if that doesn't matter or you listen to them alone like me, you will be set for years on end. Top-notch for the price point. They also sound great no matter what you are listening to, whether it be hard rock or any old YouTube video.
The Sehhheiser HD 599s are very nice looking headphones and are the most comfortable of five sets I have tried. That said I want headphones to sound good as well and the HD 599s just weren't cutting it This is where the HD 599s fall a bit short in my opinion.The build quality is pretty decent, a bit plasticky, but otherwise nice. The Ivory color is different, but I them to be very pleasing to look at. The ear cups are extremely comfortable, with nice velour cushions that I could probably have worn for listening to an entire record maybe even two. My only gripe about the build quality would be that the headband is a bit to easily adjusted.Now for the sound quality. I ended up getting a set of Sennheiser HD 560S and spent an hour or so listening to both of them on the same album, replaying the tracks of the record over and over, first listening to the HD 599s then the HD 560S. The album I was listening to was Wishbone Ash on Deca Records, and recorded on 180 gram vinyl. I also listened to both sets with my equalizer set flat, no adjustments. I found the HD 599s to be lacking in detail, a bit muddy, not as clear over-all and somewhat muffled or toned down. The top end is not as clear and concise as I found the HD 560S set to be. The soundstage of the HD 560S headphones I found to be more complete, spacious and quite good. In short, the HD 599s lack the detail, clarity and soundstage of the HD 560S headphones; if you like a mellow, less punchy sound the HD 599s might be for you. For me I want to hear the same detail and clarity as I'm hearing with my Polk Audio Signature S60 tower speakers hooked up to my Rotel receiver. The HD 560S come pretty close to that sound, but they are slightly less comfortable, which is a bit hard to understand as the build is very similar to that of the HD599s, maybe they will loosen up some and become just as comfortable. Only Time will tell.This is my second try at headphones in the $150 price range, the first pair were the Audio-Technica ATH-M50XGM, which if found to be excellent as far as sound quality, but after a very short period made my ears hurt. So I returned them and after searching and reading reviews, decided to give the HD 599s a try.My suggestion would be to buy all three of these headphones and give them a try. In this price range the HD 560S are my choice. I'd like to keep trying more brands but, not too many out there have the oval ear cups that actually sit completely over the ears. My ears are very sensitive and become sore easily, so the oval cups are a must for me. If you can tolerate a round ear cup, try the Audio-Technica ATH-M50XGM vs the Sennheiser HD560S. Good luck in your choice and happy listening.
I recently needed to replace my pair of over the ear headphones so I began my search for a good pair of headphones in the $150-$200 range. Immediately Senhiser, Beyerdynamic, and Audio‚ÄëTechnica stood out. I first received a pair of the Audio‚ÄëTechnica ATH M-50x which had good sound but were very uncomfortable if worn for more than an hour or so. Then I picked up a pair of the Beyerdynamic DT 770. These headphones had amazing sound quality and comfort but the passive sound isolation was mediocre at best. Which is why I ordered a pair of the Beyerdynamic Premium 990 which are open back. I figured that the sound quality and comfort would be similar but the open back quality would allow me to talk with others while I played music. Unfortunately the 990's had worse sound quality than the 770 (a bit harsher sounding and not as clear) and were very uncomfortable even after only a couple of hours. During this time I also ordered a pair of Senhiser HD 599 headphones. While these headphones have a significantly different sound signature than the others I have tried, they were of similar quality. Overall the HD 599's were slightly less comfortable than the 770's but the open back quality was convenient and the sound was quite nice. I would have been satisfied with the HD 599's but they were the only pair of headphones I could not drive with my desktop. They produced terrible static. This did not occur when I used the 599's on other devices or when I used other headphones (even those with similar impedance and SPL) driven by my desktop computer. This prevented me from keeping them. I have attached a breakdown of my thoughts below:------------Sound Quality------------Beyerdynamic DT 770 (80 Ohm) - WinnerHighs - Quite good representation, much cleaner than SenhiserMids - Quite good representationLows - A little closed sounding but overall they are handled wellOverall this is how the music should sound. They perform the most similar to my pair of Martin Logan Motion 15's (bookshelf speakers)Beyerdynamic Premium 990 (32 Ohm)Highs - Similar to the 770's but rather harsh soundingMids - Nothing special, no major issuesLows - Not as powerful as the 770's but more spacious. Seemed a bit washed out due to the open back designSenhiser HD 599 (50 Ohm) - Close 2nd BestHighs - Not quite as poppy as they should be. They are a bit muted in the sound signature which can make them less fatiguing than other, more analytical, headphones.Mids - A bit to high level for me, it tended to make punk rock music sound very close and muddiedLows - A bit boomy but very spaciousAudio Technica ATH M-50xHighs - Quite good representation, a bit cold thoughMids - Nothing special, no major issues thoughLows - Too over-emphasized-----------------Comfort---------------Beyerdynamic DT 770 - WinnerPerfect. I wore these on multiple occasions for more than 7 hours and never noticed any pressure points or discomfort. The headband is larger than average to distribute the pressure. The clamp pressure is also a bit more than average but this was not an issue due to the soft, replaceable, ear pads.Beyerdynamic Premium 990I could not wear these for more than a few hours. The headband is made of a much harder material than the 770's and causes a painful pressure point on the top of my head. I believe this is made worse by the lower clamping force since more of the weight is on the top of your head.Senhiser HD 599I could wear these for several hours as long as I moved them around every 30-40 minutes. More comfortable than the 990's. Significantly less clamping force than the 770's.Audio Technica ATH M-50xThese were the least comfortable. I could only stand to wear them for an hour or so before I had to take them off. All of the discomfort came from the top of my head.----------------Usability---------------Beyerdynamic DT 770These come with a permanently attached 10ft cable. That was a lot of cable to get in my pocket every time I got up from my desk. The cable also has more insulation making it much thicker and stiffer than average.Beyerdynamic DT 990These come with a permanently attached 10ft cable. That was a lot of cable to get in my pocket every time I got up from my desk. The cable also has more insulation making it much thicker and stiffer than average. The open back design was also a plus for me since I work in a semi-quiet office environment and I could still hold a conversation with someone while listening to music. But I could not hear others quite as well as I could with the HD 599's.Senhiser HD 599The interchange-able cables with different lengths worked perfect for home listening as well as on the go. The cable is also thinner and more flexible than the Beyerdynamic cable. The open back design was also a plus for me since I work in a semi-quiet office environment and I could still hold a conversation with someone while listening to music. The only downfall is the issue I had with compatibility between some devices and this pair of headphones where I would hear static or computer noise when driving them with a computer.Audio Technica ATH M-50xI really love the long coiled cable that came with these. To me this is the best option since I dont have to lug around a long cable or risk losing extra cables. With that being said, it also came with a ~ 9ft straight cable and 3ft straight cable if the coiled cable is too much for you.
I've owned these for a couple of years now - bought on the last black friday on sale for around $100, based on reviews.  I knew they would go on sale, because these are the Amazon Special Edition, and they historically go on sale every black friday and every amazon day.  These are the best headphones I've ever owned, and I've owned headphones that cost double what I paid for these.  Open-back, wide soundstage, great for gaming.  The only negative I can think of is that they aren't wireless, but that's a small price to pay for the quality they give.  I have large ears and wear glasses and they comfortably fit over them.  Highest praise.  If you're hesitating just buy them, check reviews on YT and you can always return them if you don't like them.  But I'm betting you will.

Quick Summary: (4/5)The Sony WH-1000XM3 is a great pair of headphones that hold their own against the tenured Bose. The Sony's provide a fun and full listening experience to a wide array of music genres that will make most perfectly content with their purchase. Bose's QC headphones will provde a more refined and pleasent listening experience especially for the discerning listener and will provide a stronger noise cancelling performance in a home or office setting. The stronger sound signature of the Sony will hold out better in a lounder atmosphere such as a plane, train, or automobile with its stronger bass performance. The Sony's lack the grace and balance of the QCs, but will provide a more familiar experience to the majority of listeners and will appeal more to someone who likes the sound of Apple's Beats, but is looking for a more professional or subtle design.Full Review:For the Sony WH-1000XM3 ($350), I will primarily compare it to the Bose Quiet Comfort (QC)($350) since even though they are all in the same relative price range, they are technically closer in price and age. I will also provide a little comparison to Bose's NC700 ($400) and Sennheiser's Momentum ($400) in the summary. Also, I will primarily discuss the pair of headphones in question and how it relates feature-wise to the Bose's Quiet Comfort (not QCII) headphones while refraining from giving too many details about the others, since you can read more specifically about those pairs individually in the review posted under their respective products. The reason for that is mainly to keep the review from becoming a master's thesis in subjective preferences. :)Initial Impression:Starting with the packaging. Simple and straight forward. The outer shell has a nice texture to it, but sliding out the insert with the headphones in it reveals a very simple package structure made up of just the case holding the headphones inside a box. However, the case itself feels really nice and has a sleek color palette. Very appealing to feel and look at in my opinion. Although the case is a touch bigger than the one for Bose's QC, it does a better job of holding its headphones. The QC's case always feels uncomfortably tight when putting them away. Sony's case neatly holds everything comfortably (without having to squish them in to zip it closed). The case is stiff, but not really hard. The inside is the same as the QCs with a soft microfiber feel to it. The headphones fold up inside with three little slots to the right for (inside to outside) the airplane adapter, 3.5mm aux cord, and USB Type-C charger cable.The Headphones:When I first picked them up out of the case, they felt nice. Soft plastic with a good feel to them. The plastic has a sparkle to it with a matte finish that resists fingerprinting decently. The band of leatherette on top is soft and has good cushion. Similarly around the ear cups. Very soft and nice to the touch. Not as stiff as the QCs. The click of the band when expanding it is satisfyingly stiff. At the top of both ear cups, you can see one of the microphones in a rose gold finish. Some other smaller holes are hidden around more subtly for the NC array. I feel this is a minor plus for the Sonys. The QC's microphones are a little more prominent and pick up wind a lot more outside. The USB Type-C port is at the bottom of the right cup with an indicator light. The left cup has the power button along the bottom back with the button for toggling the noise cancelling level just above it. Inside the ear cups, there is microfiber layer covering the drivers over a layer of foam. Overall the Sony's feel a little lighter than the QC's but also feel just slightly more flimsy when handling them. But the design is also more appealing and fluid and frankly more premium.When comparing the headphones while putting them on, the QC again feel more snug and naturally isolating before turning them on. The cups feel like they form a better seal given the stiffer covers and the QC also have angled drivers that leave natural room for your ears inside the cup, making the headphones not feel like they are sitting on your ears, but rather around them. The Sony are by no means uncomfortable, but may tend to be less comfortable for longer wear times and might make your ears prone to getting hotter.Sound Quality:For starters in this section, I will compare the noise cancelling. Upon turning the Sonys on, you are greeted by a woman's voice that sounds like it is in a tin can or cave when she speaks. When the NC kicks in, it does a darn good job of removing ambient sound and muffling people talking somewhat. It feels very close to the NC of the QCs, but I would still give them a leg up because the Sonys have a much more noticeable white noise factor playing whereas the QC feel more like they just sucked the sound out of the atmosphere around you. For the traveling folk (I primarily wear them in a typical office setting which any of these work plenty well for), I would say given the more aggressive, forward, pronounced sound stage with the Sonys, you will find them blocking sound better in a car or plane without the sound (especially on the lower, bass end) being washed out. The QCs have better NC, but the sound is softer in general so the sound still gets overwhelmed in a car/plane. I am not saying the NC is not doing its job, just that what you are left with is weaker with the QCs because the sound itself is subtler and more refined so you have to turn them up louder to make up for this.Now, it is difficult to judge sound since it is so subjective, but I will try to give my own impression of what each headphone may be better for. I listen to a wide range of genres, so I can appreciate many styles of music and how they are represented by different types of headphones and speakers. First, the Sonys bring a more forward sound. The sound stage isn't as wide as the QCs. Instruments get mixed together and lost in the fray. The sound of the Sonys feels more akin to that of Beats Studio. The bass is more pronounced and punchy which may be more appealing to some. If you prefer a balanced and clean representation, the QCs will serve you better. As you turn the volume up, the Sonys also lose more of their balance and can become muddy. The QCs give more of an impression that the music is playing around you, while the Sonys just feel like they're playing music. (if you really want to feel like you are on stage with the music, Sennheiser's HD800S is king. The HD700 or HD660S do a good job too at a better price, but these are all studio headphones, so totally different use case to begin with.)Where I really felt more of the performance shining through came in the Rap, R&B, or even some EDM/House area. I can definitely appreciate Sony more for some 2pac, Destiny's Child, Infected Mushroom, or Daft Punk. They are little too aggressive for music you may want a finer touch with such as jazz or opera. When listening to some Kenny G, David Benoit, or Keiko Matsui, you get that groove, but the fine details and intricacies of the instruments are sacrificed. Also, the sharp trills of the piano keys and saxophone are a bit much at higher volumes. The visceral in-your-face nature of the sound also makes them pretty fun for bands in the vein of Disturbed, Five Finger Death Punch, Pantera, and Metallica. Going a bit further that direction, with the likes of Eluveitie and Slayer it will be more likely to give you a headache from the unsubdued highs and thrashing sounds. Taking a couple steps back and going for some more classic rock like the Eagles, Journey, Gerry Rafferty, etc., the QC will perform better, but they are fine with Sony's headphones. Finally, when listening to music with a gentler atmosphere like Norah Jones, Ray LaMontagne, Ludovico Einaudi, or Celtic Woman, I would have to give it to Bose's QCs again but the Sony did liven them up a bit in a way.Features:Both Sony and QC have three levels of NC. High, Ambient sounds, and off. The QC handle this a lot better. The mid level for the Sony feels worthless and clumsy without audio playing. It almost sounds better being turned off. On the QC, the mid level provides a good balance and allows you to wear them outside on a windy day with reduced noise from the wind in the NC microphone. However, in the case of the QC (instead of the QCII), you need the app to change the NC level.The QC claim 20 hours of battery, which I have thoroughly proven to be true in the years I have owned them. Sony's claim 30 hours, which I have also found to be true, but I haven't had them nearly as long to see how they hold up over time. Also having had the QCs for longer, I have had to replace the ear pads after about 2 years. This process was easy and made them feel and sound new again with the better seal of fresh pads. The process for both headphones appears to be the same.Call quality is great for both headphones. I also use them for Skype calls from my laptop at work where they work great. However, this is one of those places the Sony completely dropped the ball. Bose's QCs allow two devices connected at the same time, and you can switch seamlessly between them which makes them great for the office. I have them on the laptop and my phone at the same time. I can listen to music while working. When its meeting time, I just join the Skype call and it immediately picks up. If I get a call on my phone, it switches back over. When I am done, music is ready to go. I don't have to touch anything. Next time I turn them on, it picks backup to the laptop and my phone immediately.Both charge fast. Just a few minutes will give me a couple hours of use in a pinch. Both also have apps. The Bose app is laid out better and more useful, but neither are really great or even necessary except in the case of the Bose being able to sync two pairs of Bose headphones to play the same music or audio through both. This may be a good deal for a couple seeking to both watch a movie on a plane or something. I have done this a couple times and it works well once setup. It is a nice feature in favor of Bose, but I haven't really found a lot of use for it in reality.For the Sonys, you have the features with the right cup having touch controls. This is fairly slick and works better than I expected. It only took a couple attempts to get the hang of it and it is responsive. Swipe up and down for volume. Swipe left and right for skipping tracks. Double tap to play and pause. And finally, if you hold your fingers on the right ear cup, it will turn the volume down and turn on the external microphone to catch ambient sound if you need to talk to someone really quick without stopping your music. A nice feature, but I personally haven't found much use for it. Might be useful for people in a bigger city like NYC walking around with the headphones constantly and you don't want to take them off every time you need to listen for a moment.Conclusion:Sony's WH-1000XM3 are no slouch and stand up for themselves at this price range. For someone looking for a pair of headphones with solid noise cancelling, flexible and diverse performance across genres and premium features, you won't go wrong with these. I dock them to 4/5 stars simply because in my own opinion, they fall short of Bose's QC series at the same price range in the overall quality and balance of the sound, noise cancellation ability, and the ability to connect to two devices at once and seamlessly hand off between them which is extremely handy for business people in today's multi-device world. Now, for my brief mention of the slightly more expensive options in the Bose NC700 and Sennheiser Momentum. If you are willing to step just a bit further up to the $400 mark, you will get even better quality, better noise cancelation, more premium feel and just overall better devices. However, I will propose that with the Sony or Bose QCs, you would not go wrong. For the majority of people, I would not say the extra money is worth it for the marginal increase over these headphones. It will mostly come down to your preference in sound.I will try to keep these reviews updated as time goes on and if anything comes up. Feel free to ask any questions and I will give a response when I can.
All right. I figure it's about time to write up a review of these headphones, seeing as I've spent some decent time with them and the Christmas sales should be happening and some of you may be wondering if you should spring for these - OR - wait it out until the next model Mk IV eventually shows up.The most frequent question I get is "How long do these last with Noise Cancellation on?"With the ANC (active noise cancellation) function ON - I've seen about 22-24 hours or so of Bluetooth-connected operation with these. The noise cancellation operation / ambient sound mode of these headphones are run entirely by the internal charged battery.Someone asked me a while back if with the headphones connected to your phone via the headphone cable, if they would still have noise cancellation / ambient sound mode even if the battery was dead and the answer is no, no they will not. You can still listen to music through the 3.5 mm physical cable with a depleted battery, but noise cancellation will not be available. Actually, you also can't use Bluetooth / noise cancellation when even in the process of charging these headphones‚Ä¶ (see "gripes" towards end of review).. so I guess it's good Sony decided to bestow a quick-charge 5-hour use time after a 10-minute charge function into these (using a wall receptacle USB adapter of course).Basically how it works is if you have an energized battery in the headphones you can use the noise cancellation and the Bluetooth connection - which also serves to activate the right ear cup touch-pad to perform functions on the headset.If you have an energized battery and decide to use the direct 3.5mm headphone cable to connect to your phone or computer instead, you can still use the noise cancellation, but the touch-pad will not be available to utilize as the cord now takes over for Bluetooth to serve music (and as it depends upon the Bluetooth connection to "talk" to the paired device for functions, the touch-pad is disabled).If you have a depleted battery you cannot use noise cancellation or the touch-pad but you can still get sound out of them like a regular pair of headphones by using the 3.5mm cable plugged into your phone or computer.The connectivity through Bluetooth seems really robust. I have had only one minor issue since owning these where the sound of what I was listening to hiccupped out for a fraction of a second a couple times, but I think it had more to do with my phone not behaving at that moment and not the headphones themselves causing the problem. Walking around inside or outside or for traveling, the connection has remained stable since.How "Good" the active noise cancellation works in any pair of headphones is somewhat subjective... but I can say these work really well, bearing a few things in mind and that we've not quite reached the technological level yet of producing truly silent headphones the quiets absolutely everything. Not for $350 dollars anyway.The headphone Manual itself states that "Noise Cancellation" works primarily in the low frequency band and that although noise is reduced, it is not completely cancelled.I can best equate the effect with just the active noise cancellation mode on and with nothing playing through them, to having a good set of hearing protection earplugs in your ears.Everything sounds reduced, especially things like dronning, humming, knocking and footsteps...there is a general quieter sound you experience, but you're not left completely oblivious to some noise coming through a little.These headphones will not surround you in a magical protective vacuum bubble when you have them on.However:The real magic happens when you start playing music through these headphones or listening to a movie or such. With the active noise cancellation diminishing the outside sound pretty well all on its own, the sonic enjoyment of what is playing through the headphones is not restricted at all... you get full volume, clarity and bass and that simply causes the outside world to melt away, leaving you with a little comfort-cocoon that really does impress.I have had very good success with these headphones canceling out unwanted noises and / or being able to enjoy what I want to listen to across a range of scenarios: Noisy Neighbors next door doing noisy things, kids pounding around upstairs in the house, traveling in the car (as a passenger of course - not driving!), a couple bus commutes, and so forth.As for the sound quality, I will say that they are very good. These are not high-end audiophile reference headphones costing thousands of dollars, but there is definitely high-quality audio out of these with a nice sound stage and separation with additional tweeking you can do through Sony's Headphone Connect application to adjust equalization and bass.These are not the loudest headphones I've ever used... I've had models that are almost obnoxious in their power delivery, to the point of being painful to listen to with the volume all the way up. I am the type of listener who likes a bit of punchiness in their music, but also appreciates nuances over ham-fisted bass slamming into my ear canals at the expense of everything else...and I will say that with the noise cancellation feature turned on, I'm actually enjoying music at a lower volume level than I'd need with other headphones. The WH-1000XM3's ability to effectively mute the outside distractions allows me to concentrate on what I'm listening to, and I don't need the volume cranked up to enjoy a range of music.I did have to tweek a few things with the app to suit my preferences, but I am left very happy with what these can deliver. Of note, you can set two "Custom" EQ settings in the app, so one you might use for punchier bass and the other for higher treble or vocal listening.The weight of these is impressively light. I might have been initially expecting them to have a weightier feel... maybe because I was thinking that with the added components necessary for noise cancellation, those would increase the headphone weight by several ounces. I'm happy to report that these headphones are able to be worn comfortably for extended duration with no feeling of pinched ears or sore spots. The ear cups on the WH-1000XM3's are of a more oval design than circular as found on my older Sony MDR-XB950BT headphones, and this makes them very comfortable to wear even laying back on a pillow or car seat. The thick padded circular ear cups on other headphones tends to press up against the back of a pillow or seat, and causes some pressure and discomfort against the back of my ears if worn too long when reclined.No such issues with these.I have seen a few complaints online about people reporting that their ears get warm after wearing these for a while. Having spent some time with these, I personally think it's the effect of just wearing a pair of closed-back headphones with snug-fitting padded ear cups causing this. Every pair of closed-back headphones I've worn with padding that encapsulate your ears will get to feeling a little warm after extended sessions with them on. For me personally, I have not had discomfort with these on even after a few hours of listening to music and watching a movie with the noise cancellation activated.The Phone Call microphone is something that many people seem to have initially hated on these headphones - many comments about how "it's garbage" and so on, reside on the internet.I am not sure where the hate is coming from, as I've had no issues making or taking phone calls with these, and nobody has complained about the call / microphone quality. Maybe Sony updated something in later production runs, but for whatever reason, the microphone seems fine on my pair. Certainly no worse than other headphones I've used. I will note that I did update the firmware to version 4.2.2 when I first fired-up the Sony App and when I used the headphones for the first time, so possibly that update may have corrected previous microphone problems.I have tested charging the WH-1000XM3's using an Anker PowerCore II 20000 battery bank and with a longer Anker USB-C to USB-A type cable than what Sony provides (see quibbles below), and they work together fine. The Anker battery bank will certainly output a 1.5 A current or more easily, which is what these headphones require for standard charging times.In conclusion, I am very happy with the Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones.Some people may consider these to be really expensive at $350 dollars US, but I don't think thats necessarily true. They're about $100 dollars more than other good quality headphones with similar performance sans active noise cancellation.Is the extra $100 bucks for having ANC worth it? To me, Yes. Definitely.The noise cancellation ability of these has allowed me to enjoy quiet time and listening pleasure that otherwise I wouldn't be able to have with regular headphones.You'll have to decide for yourself, but in a world with an ever increasingly loud and invasive noises you have to contend with daily, I've really really gotten to love using these, despite a few issues I don't really like.****************************************************Some minor quibbles:A literally 6-inch long USB-C to USB-A power cable, Sony?I just shelled out $350 bucks for a set of your headphones and you stuck me with a barely-useable power cable, never mind no included USB power adapter?You couldn't get the bean counters to authorize even a foot of cable? Jeeze.If you buy these headphones you are going to for sure want a longer USB-C to USB-A cable to charge these with.  Anker has some nice ones you can get right here on Amazon.The right-hand ear cup touch-pad is novel, and it has worked for me fine.My only little grumble about it, is the function to pause the music or accept a phone call requires you to do a quick double-tap with your finger on the center of the ear cup touch-pad. Problem is, my ear is in there and the sound of my finger quickly tapping it makes a loud "Thump-Thump!" sound I find annoying. I would have MUCH preferred a physical button instead.I picked the "silver / grey" model color of these headphones, simply because they looked a bit different than the boring ol' black every other headphone comes in. I have noticed that depending on the color temperature of the surrounding light, they can appear to look anywhere from a silver / grey coloration to more of a champagne / very light tan in color. It's not off-putting, and I do like the color of the headphones... but some of you may not appreciate the reactive effect these have in either cool or warm colored light.  Figured I'd mention it.My big gripe: You cannot CHARGE these headphones and at the same time, listen with them using Bluetooth or with the ANC on. That seems backwards as Hell to me, considering I probably own at least 10 other electronic devices that CAN be used WHILE they are charging. My Smart Phone, yup. DSLR camera, sure. Voice Recorder, indeed. Graphing Calculator, Uh-huh. Sony MiniDisc Player from literally 15 YEARS ago? YES.So why is it that with these modern $350 headphones, you can't plug them into a usb wall adapter, laptop, or battery bank with a USB-C cable and keep enjoying ANC and Bluetooth connection and listening enjoyment while charging? The moment you plug the USB-C charging cable into these, you lose all Bluetooth and ANC, and the sound shuts off until you stick the physical corded 3.5mm cable into the audio source‚Ä¶which at this point means you're now using a pair of regular headphones because again: No Bluetooth, no Active Noise Cancellation going on.Very very strange, and although with 20+ hours of listening on tap with a full charge, I still question if this isn't something that really should be improved upon with version Mark IV.Wishes for FUTURE:  Improved ANC with better elimination of higher pitched / sharp noises, maybe an available headphone stand that can provide the headphones with some type of inductive charging might be nice. Oh, and let us be able to charge AND listen to these with Bluetooth / ANC active at the same time please, Sony.
I currently own about 30 headphones of various brands and types.  I have tried many Bluetooth headphones and own the Bose QC35 II and Bowers and Wilkins PX.  I bought both the Sony WH-1000x MKI & MKII but returned them after weighing the shortcomings vs the cost, my main complaints being comfort and sound (the ANC was always good).  My portable-everyday-beat-them-up headphones were the Bose QC 35 II.  I liked them primarily for the comfort and ANC.  The sound on the Bose can best be described as adequate but generally lifeless.  Always in search of something better I read a couple of ‚ÄúFirst Look‚Äù articles about the Sony WH-MX1000M3 and decided to pull the plug on the first day that they were available on Amazon.  When I received the Sony‚Äôs I was pleased to see that the case was similar to the Bose QC 35, a little bigger but shaped well enough to fit comfortably in my backpack.  When I removed the headphones and put them on my head I realized immediately that these would be as comfortable as the Bose.  Good job Sony.After charging for a couple of hours I paired them to my phone and went to my headphone test playlist on Spotify.  My main complaint with the previous Sony model's sound was that they had very little soundstage (defined as perceived distance between your ears and the music) and little definition (defined as the clarity and separation of the various instruments in a piece of music).  The M3 sounded better than the previous Sony‚Äôs and better than the Bose, but the highs appeared to be quite subdued and overwhelmed by the bass.  This was disappointing.But, Sony has a phone app that allows for EQ so I go download the app.  Frustration. The app did not recognize the MK3.  Patience.  I figure that Sony has not updated the app yet.  So I wait a day and see that the Sony app has automatically updated on my phone.  I open and hurray! It is recognizing the MK3 now.  Now I can play with EQ:  -1 on 400 Hz.  +1 on 1K.  +2 on 2.5K.  +3 on 6K.  +4 on 16K and ‚ÄúClear Bass‚Äù remains at 0.  Play music and now were talking!  I‚Äôm not going to say that these sound nearly as good as most of my wired headphones, but for everyday-on-the-go-beat-them-up-with-ANC these are exciting.  They blow the Bose away.  The Bowers and Wilkins PX which weigh about three times more than the Sony‚Äôs have decent BT sound when the ANC is off but the sound changes considerably and not for the better when you apply one of three ANC modes.  They PX is OK for about an hour of no ANC listening while sitting at home, but after that my ears and the top of my head hurt.The noise cancellation of the Sony is a generation ahead of Bose.  There, I said it.  Most reviewers crown the Bose as the best ANC you can get.  Well,  Sony has just showed Bose that they are the new big boy on the block.  I did some A/B comparisons with both headphones and realized that the Sony not only cancels steady noise like jet engines or the sound of the air conditioning intake in my condo, but it does a great job of virtually eliminating all other sounds, including television voices and even other people, as my wife can attest to when she had to stand in front of me and wave her hands to get my attention because I could not hear her talking (so, if you want to block out your wife‚Äôs talking‚Ä¶ LOL!).  And this is without even messing with the settings in the app.  Others reviewer here have not had the same experience, stating that it does not cancel voices.  I frankly did not expect it to cancel voices, but I must say that the Sony comes as close as anything I have ever not heard.So, if you want very comfortable headphones with the best sound and Active Noise Cancelling that you can expect with wireless Bluetooth in 2018 get these.  They will not sound as good as wired closed back or open back headphones, but ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt always get what you want‚Äù, ‚Äúnothing is perfect‚Äù, and ‚Äúeverybody is different‚Äù.In addition to the Sony WH-1000XM3 during this review period I used:Bose QC 35 IIBowers & Wilkins PXBang and Olufsen H6 (wired)Sennheiser HD650 (wired)AKG 7KXX (wired)SpotifyFlac files on phone and desktop computerUPDATE 2018-09-21:  I did experience an issue with phone calls where people at the other end were hearing an echo of their voice.  I tested the headphones with three different phones and the problem occurred with all three.  So I replaced them through Amazon.  I am glad to say that the new pair does not have the issue.  After some tests with phone calls I will say that Sony still needs to do some work on the call quality at the other end of the call (the call sounds fine in the Sony itself).  In this regard, the Bose QC 35 is better.  I think the call quality is really with the sound processing that Sony has implemented and not the hardware.  Hopefully this will be improved in future firmware upgrades.  Another minor con that the Bose handles better is the support for multiple BT sources.  But this is a minor annoyance and I only use the Sony's for my phone anyway, so I am not constantly switching sources.  Small price to pay for better ANC and musical sound.
I had Bose headsets for travel for over 20 years. I had Bose QC-1, QC-2; I still have QC-20 wired earbuds and aviation headset A20. Recently, I had a challenge of finding headset which not only works to cancel noise in an airplane, but which also works better than earplugs at home, especially to reduce noise of piano played in a different room. I compared Sony 1000XM3 with Bose QC35 and 700 at a store, bought two pairs of Sony, and compared them with Bose QC-20 and A20. On top of that, I did tons of research.To begin with, Bose used to be "the king of noise cancellation" for many years. This reign is coming to an end: the competition is fierce. In pro aviation world, Lightspeed created a strong competition to Bose, while in the consumer world, Sony came up with a product widely superior in noise cancellation. Bose tried to answer Sony with Bose 700, but it is still inferior in noise cancellation and usability and features of the phone app.According to independent testing data available on the internet, Sony's noise cancellation is up to 6 dB better than Bose. If you are not familiar with dB scale, it is a log scale, and 6 dB is a little more than a factor of 2. Noise cancellation efficiency is frequency dependent, so it is hard to compare apples to apples.  Power spectrum across all frequency gives an about 2 dB advantage to Sony (29 dB compared to 27 dB of Bose 700), in low frequency range Sony beats Bose with a high margin (about 6 dB), in high frequency range Bose appears to be better. Yet, when you put Sony on your head, followed by Bose, and switch back and forth, Sony is impressively better. Like, way better.  Tons better. So much better that you sometimes wonder if Bose is turned on at all.Comparing Sony XM3 with Bose QC20, Sony is better in all respects other than small size and weight of QC20. Noise cancellation is better, and sound quality is better. Comparison with aviation headset A20 shows that A20 is slightly superior in terms of noise cancellation (and, surprisingly, even in sound quality), probably due to a passive noise cancellation component - but A20 is a $1100 headset with a massive wire and console, and connectors are not compatible with consumer electronics. You would never consider it unless you fly an airplane as a pilot. High frequency hissing, which existed up to QC15 and still present in A20 (introduced in 2015) is almost gone in both newer Bose and in Sony. Difference in noise cancellation quality between Bose A20 and Sony XM3 is worth maybe $50, but not $800. I think we are talking about several dB, nothing major.Sound quality is subjective. Neither Sony nor Bose 700 are audiophile grade. One cannot tell the difference while playing music via Bluetooth from a phone, but plug them with a cable into a headphone amplifier and play 24/96 music, compare with Hi-Fi headphones (I have good old Sennheiser HD-620 which used to be in the top 10 best some 20 years ago; not anymore, but they are still great sounding high end headphones) - and you can tell immediately that these are not Hi-Fi headphones. Not even close. With a good sound source, they sound dull and sound stage is not there. But they sound well enough for daily use, for playing music from the phone, certainly better than most earbuds. Sony sounds a little better than Bose 700 to my taste, but it is close, very close, there are small difference in color of the sound which are very subjective. I rated the sound five stars because this is not a Hi-Fi headset, it is a noise cancelling headset, and the price is determined primarily by its noise cancellation abilities.  As long as you can listen to music and enjoy it, as long as it does not sound like cheap earbuds, it is OK. For really high quality of sound without noise cancellation, there are much better options in the same price range.App is not required with Sony and Bose (despite misleading information on the web, either headset can be used without the app), but Sony app is much better. It does not require registration and has many more features, including adjustment of noise cancellation to ambient pressure.Sony, to my surprise, works very well for phone calls in the office environment. There were many reports that Bose was vastly superior, perhaps this is the case when one needs aggressive noise cancellation, like on the street among cars and people.  Or maybe Sony made updates to firmware which fixed the issues which they had. When answering calls at home, the sound quality on the other end of the line is excellent. People cannot tell I am wearing a headset.Comfort is purely subjective and depends on one's head size and shape. I have a big head, so most headphones exert some pressure. Sony is no exception, but I am fine with that. I must say, the most comfortable headset for my head is Bose QC 35 II, followed by  Sony XM3 and followed by Bose 700. Bose 700 feels a tad cooler on the ears.  A20 creates too much pressure on my ears.For travel (e.g., vacation) QC20 is hard to beat, due to their very small size. They are inferior to XM3 or latest Bose, but do their job well enough. For use at home or in the office, bluetooth headsets with better noise cancellation and better sound and with the ability to make calls are the way to go.Finally, cancellation of piano sounds. My wife teaches piano full time from home. Sound is a problem in our home. When I am in the same room as our grand piano, I can hear it loud and clear, although much less loud than without the headset. However, when I go to my office and close the door (which is a glass door which only partially blocks the sounds), I can barely hear it and can focus on whatever I am doing without distraction from the sounds. I tried QC20 for this purpose, and they were not quite up to the task. I got the 33 NRR rated 3M earplugs, and they also were not perfect either. I can tell that Sony XM3 works better. I would not use XM3 to work with power tools, though. They are too expensive and possibly too fragile for a workshop, and the benefit is not large enough to warrant the difference in price.Build quality of Sony seems to be better than Bose (and less expensive, too). The headset is made in Malaysia. Bose, I must say, can make great quality headsets (A20, with 5 years warranty, is an evidence to that), but consumer grade headsets always had an almost marginal quality. Bose, by the way, does not repair them once they are out of warranty. They make you buy new ones with a discount. Two of my old Bose headphones broke and I had to replace them because repair option was not offered, and lifetime of synthetic leather ear pads was too short for a quality product. It is too early to say how well Sony would last - we will see.After buying the first headset on Amazon, I got another one for my son. My son absolutely wanted Bose, but after comparing them side by side in a store, and listening to mine, he said, I still like Bose, but I recognize that Sony is better in all respects... So we got him Sony from a local store.The only frustrating part is that Amazon has dropped the price by $50 after I bought both pairs! What a bummer - but now, Bose is completely not competitive.The only downside which I found so far... Sony can connect to two Bluetooth devices simultaneously, but it is confusing how the preference works (the one connected last has the higher preference for audio), and there is no easy way to change the preference or even disconnect a specific sound source. You cannot do it in the app. I think Bose is the same way. I also struggled with connecting to my desktop PC for audio and gave up attempts to set up the audio preference correctly. Either I did not figure out how to do it correctly, or something can be improved in the next releases of the App and firmware. I am sure it will be done, eventually.For what it is worth, competition between suppliers is good - it drives features and quality up and prices down. I hope, Bose will catch up eventually - they missed the opportunity to do it with the 700. Sony 1000XM3  remains the best product in this class for second year in a row.
Around the holidays, I decided to treat myself to a pair of high quality headphones. I live in the central area of a major US city, and to be frank the noise pollution was driving me a little crazy. I was interested in a pair of headphones that would give me some peace and quiet, so I spent a lot of time looking at ANC (active noise-Cancelling) options and the Sony WH1000MX3 and Bose QuietComfort 35 II were easily the top picks among reviews.However, there were a lot of different opinions about which was better. The split was pretty 50/50 between the Sony and Bose, so I was pretty torn. Even though they were heavily discounted for the holidays ($300 each after taxes), that's a lot of money considering I generally never spend more than $50 for headphones. So I bought them both as an experiment, with the plan to return one after I made a decision.Let me get this out of the way now, because I'm going to get pretty detailed below. Ultimately, I understand why there's such a debate about whether the Sony or Bose is better. They are both fantastic headphones and I love them both. I love them so much, that I made the probably financially irresponsible decision to keep them both! They were both so good, but in better than the other in completely unique ways. For that reason, there is no dealbreaker that makes one better than the other -- I believe it comes down completely to personal preference and that's why there is so much debate on which is better.The TL;DR of this review is that you should buy the Sony if you value sound quality most, and don't plan to wear them for long periods of time (i.e. over 5-6 hours per session). You should buy the Bose if you value comfort the most, and if you're planning to use them for phone calls.If you're interested in a bit more detail, I'll give my opinions on these aspects: ANC, Sound, Comfort, VersatilityANCThe noise-cancelling on both of these is phenomenal. I had assumed Bose would do better at this since it's what they're known for, but I'm surprised to say the Sony's ANC is slightly better. It does a bit better blocking out non-drone sounds (i.e. people talking, sharp noises, etc) compared to the Bose. With that said, they both are practically equal and I don't think the Sony ANC is so much better than the Bose that it would justify buying them on that factor alone. When wearing either pair, I sometimes feel like a spaceman walking around my apartment because everything is so quiet.SOUNDThis is a clear winner for Sony. No questions asked, the sound is clearer, crisper, and deeper. This is especially noticeable when watching movies/TV shows or playing video games. With the Sony, I feel like I can hear each individual sound clearly, whereas with the Bose everything is a little more muddled together. With that being said, the Bose sound is perfectly acceptable and even 'good'. It's just that for a $300 pair of headphones I'd expect a more premium quality where I am amazed at how clear the sound is. The Sony does that; the Bose are a tier below.COMFORTHands down, the Bose are better. I can literally wear them for 14 hours and they don't bother me except for needing to give my ears a little air every once in a while. I have never, ever worn a pair of headphones this comfortable before. I'm especially grateful for this comfort now that I'm working from home all day because of COVID-19. The Sony headphones are a bit heavier and clamp on your head a little bit more tightly. They also press down on your ears, whereas the Bose are deep enough that my ears don't even touch the inside of the cans. The Sony are still definitely comfortable, but a tier below the Bose. I can still wear them for about 6 hours before they bother me, so if you don't wear headphones that long it might not be a problem for you.VERSATILITYThis is just a catch-all for all the other aspects of the headphones. Nothing here I would consider a selling point strong enough for most people to make a final decision, but if you have specific needs then this might be helpful.1. I like the physical buttons on the Bose more than the touch buttons on the Sony. They just work better, and I make mistakes with them less often.2. Sony has better technology. They use USB-C so the headphones charge faster than the Bose mini-hdmi. They also have better bluetooth connection technology, which lets a higher bitrate of audio transfer wirelessly. Without getting too technical, I think this is a major reason why the sound quality on the Sony is better.3.  Bose is better if you want to connect to multiple devices. Bose can connect to two devices simultaneously, but Sony can connect to only 1 device at a time. For example, if I am listening to music on my computer and I get a phone call, if I'm wearing the Bose, I can answer and talk on the call through my headset, and when I hang up music will resume. With the Sony, I'd either have to disconnect from my computer, then reconnect to my phone  before the call ended, or take off the headphones completely and answer the phone separately.4. Sony looks a little more stylish and futuristic. The Bose look like an ordinary pair of headphones. Build quality is identical thoughCONCLUSION5 months after buying these, do I regret keeping them both? NO! They are absolutely worth the money if you have it. Generally, I find that I wear the Bose throughout the day as I'm working from home. They're really comfortable to wear all day long, if I get a call from a co-worker I don't need to take them off, and I'm just listening to music as background noise while I work so sound quality isn't important. After dinner, it's always the Sony. When I'm focusing on a new album, watching a movie, or playing a video game, I really value how good the sound is. And generally I only wear them for 3-4 hours at this point so discomfort is never an issue.If you twist my arm about it and made me pick only one pair to own the rest of my life? I'd probably take the Bose just because I wear them so much while working from home. But that's not a fair metric, and each individual will have a different primary purpose for these and that should be your guiding principal when making the choice.Good luck! (longest review over)
I'll preface my review by stating that these are my first pair of bluetooth cans, as well as first pair with noise cancellation. I travel for work quite frequently and have been wanting a pair of noise cancelling headphones for quite some time. Like most, I was between the Bose QC35 ii's and these Sony WH-1000xM3s. I visited a local store and tried out both. My initial conclusion was that the Bose cans are more comfortable (lighter, deeper ear cups), but with weaker NC and a more neutral sound signature. I ended up ordering the Sony's and now have used them for 3-4 hours/day since receiving them.Build Quality/Materials - Initial thoughts upon unboxing - these are solid. The soft touch plastics used feels durable and of good quality.  These do not feel cheap to me whatsoever. The detents on the headband are well defined and feel like they'll hold up to daily adjustment. Sufficient padding on the headband as well. The ear cups are well padded and the synthetic leather feels of high quality. No creaking or odd sounds when flexing these way past what normal on/off the head use subjects them to. Only time will tell how these hold up to daily use, but I'm happy with the build quality out of the box.Fit - I have a large head. I wear a size 7-5/8 fitted baseball cap. My longest continuous listening session with these thus far was ~4 hours. No major discomfort to report. I had no fatigue along my jawline from the ear cup clamping force, and zero discomfort along the crown of my head. I will say, my ears/head get warm with these on for extended periods of time, even while stationary. When moving around the house, I started to sweat a bit. I do tend to run hot but regardless, these are a warm set of cans. I do think these will be just fine for stationary use (such as on a plane) and that's how I intend to use them 95% of the time.Noise Cancellation - One word: Wow. As mentioned above, this is my first pair of headphones with noise cancellation. I fly a lot for work and wanted the best of the best in this category. My old Sennheiser HD 429s, which are over ear/closed back, but have no noise cancellation, only really drown out ambient noise when listening at 80+% volume, which is not ideal for hours long flights. After watching the numerous comparison review videos on YouTube, and trying both the Bose QC35 ii's and these cans in store, I feel I made the right choice. The noise cancellation is truly remarkable. The quick attention feature works great as well. I can cover the right ear cup and ambient noise/voices become almost immediately audible. I've tried the Ambient Sound Mode around the house and I will say, that even with "Focus on Voice" selected, I have a hard time hearing someone speaking to me if the music volume is above ~20%. I have a flight next week and will amend this section of my review after with my thoughts on the NC on a plane.Sound Quality - I've been leary of bluetooth headphones for fear of sound degradation due to the wireless connection. My iPhone 8 Plus doesn't have a headphone jack and I've been forced to use the dongle to listen to my Sennheisers, which is less than ideal. After my first listening session with the Sonys, I can confidently say that to my untrained ears, the 1000xM3s absolutely blow my wired Sennheisers out of the water in terms of sound quality. Yes, these are 3x the cost, but I'm still incredibly impressed with the sound quality here. As others have mentioned, these were a bit bass heavy for my tastes out of the box. However, the Sony Connect app gives full EQ control over the sound profile of these cans. In my opinion, the user control available in the app truly pushes these headphones to the next level. Everyone's musical preference is different, and you have full control of the sound with this app. I'm all over the place with my music - from progressive jazz such as Pat Metheny, to the fast and furious riffs of Mastodon, to the undulating bass lines of Flamingosis and Jazzinuff. These headphones deliver! The bass is punchy (and heavy at the upper EQ levels), mids and highs come through prominently and clear, and the soundstage is spot on for my ears.Pairing & Battery Life - After unboxing, I powered on the headphones and connected them to my iPhone. Pairing was quick and painless. Battery life was at 60% out of the box. I plugged them into a 5V, 1.5 amp power adapter for 10 minutes, using the included USB-C cable, and the headphones were bumped up to 80% battery level. It seems the quick charge claims of 5 hours playback in 10 minutes of charge are valid. I've since listened to them for a total of ~15 hours, and the battery level is showing 30%. The battery level changes in 10% increments. So for my use case, 50% battery loss over 15 hours of listening = 30 hours assumed playback with a full charge. Bang on to Sony's claims. All of my listening has been with Noise Cancelling active, and anywhere from 30 - 70% volume. I'll top these up to 100% battery prior to travelling and will report back with observed battery life for a full charge.Included Accessories - The carrying case is what I expected. I see it holding up to travel just fine. The internal cable pocket is a bit tight but fits the included cables without much fuss. The included USB-C cable is shorter than I'd like, but seems to be of good quality. The included 3.5mm cable has a straight male connector at one end (for connection to the headphones) and a 90 degree connector at the opposite end. It's an acceptable length.Other Notes - I've yet to make or receive a phone call with these on. One of the most talked about negatives, at least in the reviews I've read, is how poor the microphone quality is on these headphones. I don't ever plan to take phone calls with these on, so this was never a factor in my purchasing consideration for these. But, I'm sure at some point I'll test out the mic and will report back. Lastly, single device connectivity - I only ever listen to music from my phone so this is another non issue for me. Just to try it out, I did switch listening from my phone to my laptop, and it took maybe 45 seconds to disconnect from one device, connect to the other and then start playing music again.In conclusion, I'm VERY impressed with these headphones. The noise cancellation is top notch, sound quality for a music enthusiast (read: NOT an audiophile) is excellent, the Sony Connect app is feature rich and gives the user full control, the carrying case is sufficient/in line with other headphones of this class and the build quality is great as well. Only time and use will tell how these hold up in the long run, but so far, these are hands down the best headphones I've ever had the pleasure of owning.
I'm not writing this review for any type of financial gain and I bought the headphones for market value. Naturally the opinions expressed are mine and my audio preferences may differ from yours. I have a pretty good ear for sound and have a background in home theater and audio sales and setup. Now for the review.After reading many reviews and doing more research than was probably needed I decided that Sony and Bose were the top 2 contenders. My wife had recently bought on Amazon the Utaxo, which have good reviews, are cheaper, and when I took them on a flight I was satisfied with their performance (for the price) and without a comparison to other headphones. I abused BestBuy and their return policy and purchased the Sony and the Bose. In the store I sampled the SkullCandy and they sounded bass-heavy and not clear, so I didn't include them. I also looked at the Jabra's, but after reviews believed they wouldn't be as good and left them out as well. So, I decided on the top 2 contenders and then theBeats because I see so many people wearing them, and the Utaxo for those looking for a budget set. I created a spreadsheet to help guide me and used it loosely. I attached it so you can see a little of what I was testing.If you want the quick and dirty, I'd go with the Sony. Bose is 2nd. Beats 3rd. Utaxo 4th, but a good product for the price.Years ago I was in search of good wired headphones and compared the Audio Technica m50x against Monster, Senneheiser, Beyerdynamic, Monster, Sol, VModa, SkullCandy and a few others. I ended up with the Audio Technica (AT), and I mention that so you know my sound preference. I like more of a neutral sound with full range vs too bright or too bass heavy. Let's start the review. Here are the more detailed reasons for each headphone and why I chose them...Comfort: Bose wins here but marginally. Most headphones irritate me to some extent as did the Bose, but Sony was a close second. Beats were about as comfortable as my Audio Techica's (AT), which aren't horrible by and means and Utaxo was basically tied with beats. Both moderately comfortable and I did wear the Utaxo's for an entire flight without taking them off. (4 hour flight)Passive Isolation: I used various white noise, airplane sound, background voices. Again, Bose has the slight edge with Beats trailing. Utaxo were comfortable enough, but by comparison, last place. Utaxo were comparable to my AT's, which I didn't realize how little they block out. Not great.Active Noise Reduction: I placed Bose first, but only by a hair. I had my family try the comparisons and some chose Sony, some chose Bose. They reduce at different frequencies so you can hear some sounds more on each, depending on the background noise. Both are excellent. Beats again comes in 3rd and wasn't a close third. Utaxo did a moderate job, and as I said, I was happy using them on the plane but didn't have anything to compare to. For a budget set they do the job. The winners and absolutely impressive are Bose and Sony. Maybe a tie.Sound: This is probably the most important aspect of any headphone to me. I spent hours listening to different types of music. I had cables connected to each headphone and could quickly go back and forth between each. No, I couldn't put an SPL meter on each time to ensure the volume was exact but I did use the same source material and feel I have a pretty good feel for how they all sound. In the end, this is why I kept the Sony's. They aren't perfect and they aren't audiophile quality but they are really good. The most similar to my AT's. I found the Bose to be very sibilant at times with female vocals or tracks that had high frequencies in them. It happened time and time again and was the deal breaker for me with the Bose. Sony was more neutral, had adequate bass but didn't over-emphasize the higher tones. Less ear fatigue for me in the long-run. Beats were better than I was expecting. They also had some tendencies to boost the higher tones but had good bass. The Utaxo were good enough but just not impressive. Again, I was fine with them when I had no comparison but head to head they just don't compare favorably. The Sony app also has an equalizer feature that is super quick and easy to use, has some fun (not very useful) things like surround sound, soundstage localization, and a few other somewhat gimmicky features, but is much better than the Bose.Features: I didn't test the voice features on any of the headsets. It isn't that important to me. After using the Sony's for a few weeks, I do like the touch feature and the ability to hear ambient sound by placing your hand over the right ear cup. I also enjoy the Sony app, whereas the Bose app was lacking. Bose has the traditional buttons for volume which work fine but I did prefer the Sony touch interface more. Utaxo has standard buttons as well as the Beats, all work as intended.Conclusion: The Sony and the Bose are very close and though the Bose may be slightly more comfortable, the features and especially the Sound on the Sony pushed me towards them. The ability to equalize on the fly very easily is a great feature that Sony includes in the app. The touch interface is more user friendly than Bose or the others. Beats are a fine set but I'd pay the extra $70 for the Sony. If you find a pair at a great price, you wouldn't be disappointed. The Utaxo, at around $60, are a bargain and a good set of headphones. If you never have a chance to compare you would likely be satisfied with them. They are built well, are comfortable enough and put out good enough sound to enjoy music and video. But they do place a distant 4th in terms of isolation. First Place: Sony !!
I will preface this review by stating that I own and have reviewed a great number of headphones in the past. It does not make me neither an audiophile nor an expert but it still gives me a lot of good reference.For each use, there must be a type of headphone. If you care about only the review of the Sony WH1000XM3, you can skip the following explanations.Open, Semi-Open or Closed headphones, what is that?- Open headphones are good for audiophile uses. It will yield the most fidelity to the sound but these headphones are generally meant for quiet rooms, for being used with an ampli and a DAC and for a very good audio source. These headphones will also give you the largest soundstage (the impression that the music comes from the room itself).- Closed headphones are meant to be used in noisy environments. They usually do not give you the best soundstage but you can still get a good sound. They will have much less sound leakage than the open ones.- There is also semi-Open which is a trade of between the two above.Intra-Auricular, Around your ears, on-ears, earbuds, what is that?- There are much different formats of headphones.- Intra-Auricular are the ones that go into your ear canal. They usually need a good seal to provide the best sound, especially bass. They will be the ones blocking the outside sound the best.- Earbuds are usually more generic buds like the ones that come with your phone. Usually their quality is not fantastic, except rare exceptions. Their price is generally low.- On-ears are headphones where the cans are going on your ear. They can sometimes not be too comfortable due to pressure on your ears but they are usually quite light.- Around your ears are headphones with very large cans that will encompass your ears completely. That is usually the category of preference for Audiophiles due to the large size of the drivers (50mm).Then you have the connection to the sound source:- Wired: the oldest and simplest one. Some have a remote and mic, some do not. Historically these are the ones giving you the best chance to have an optimal sound quality.- Bluetooth are wireless headphones that need power to work (batteries). The sound quality and battery life has greatly improved in the most recent years. Yet, a wired headphone will usually deliver the best sound.Last is the noise cancellation:- ANC: Active Noise Cancellation is a complex algorithm that select the frequency bands to ‚ÄúMake disappear‚Äù to allow you to listen your music in the best conditions. Although this technology has greatly improved, the resulting sound quality will never be as good as without ANC due to the difficulty in not cutting frequencies that were part of the music. Another misunderstanding is that ANC does not cancel voices so you will still hear babies crying in the plane, and even better than without it.- Passive isolation: Is usually achieved by intra-auricular buds that work as earplugs. On the ears headphones can also have a fair isolation due to the thickness of the earpads.The Sony WH1000XM3 falls into the ANC Wireless Over the ears category.Now onto the Sony WH1000XM3.As I stated, I own a very large collection of headphones, enough to last more than one lifetime so I have stopped buying more, except for when I feel like I could get a real benefit from one.It was the case for the Sony because I fly international regularly and it is always good to have a good noise cancellation in the plane when your trip last more than 8 hours.I had another passenger letting me try his pair at my request and I was favorably impressed by the comfort and noise isolation so I decided to indulge.Here is what I like about it:- Amazing comfort. I have no idea what the earpads are made of but it is a true pleasure wearing them. The pads wrap neatly around my ears with very little pressure on them, the top band does not put too much pressure either.- Best ANC I have ever experienced. The difference prior to turn it on and after is nothing short of amazing.- Very good sound. The Bass will please bassheads (listening to All the Stars from Kendrick Lamar and the bass is blasting my eardrums). The mids are very good too‚Ä¶ The highs may be the least impressive but the sound is overall excellent.- Fair price. I own more expensive headphones that are not as comfortable, do not have ANC and do not sound as good‚Ä¶- Good app. Easy to configure. Pairing was easy- Nice carry case with everything you need while flying.- Battery life is of about 30 hours when in use. It will decrease slowly when not used but not by much.- The controls are very nice too. I love the cupping of one ear to allow a temporary muting of the sound to discuss or listen without turning it off or removing it.Here is what I like less:- Absolutely nothing!In conclusion:A resounding 5 stars.This headset is not only good for travelling but at work too and even at home‚Ä¶. Love it!
The Sony WH1000XM3 headphones are 1/3 of THE trifecta of wireless headphones, including the Sony offering, the Sennheiser PXC550 headphones, and the Bose QC35-II headphones. I have been able to try all three, and can say that the Sony headphones are the winner for me.NEGATIVES:(1) I really only have found one and it's rather glaring -- these headphones can only be paired with one device at a time.  Meaning that if you've already paired them with your phone, when you want to use them with your laptop you have to completely go through the pairing process all over again.  And once you have it paired with your laptop and want to go back to your phone, you have pair everything all over again.  I really can't believe Sony botched this feature this badly, and I really don't know what they were thinking.A minor negative is that the Sony headphone app is not compatible with Android on Chromebooks. Although I have a monster bulky Asus ROG gaming laptop, I mainly use my Acer Chromebook while on the go, and although the Chromebook runs Google Play Android apps, the Sony headphone app reports that it's not compatible with this device.  So when using these headphones with my Chromebook, they're aren't anywhere near as tweakable as when I'm using it on my phone.  I'm sure it would work with a genuine Android tablet, but I don't use Android tablets anymore since I got the Chromebook.Another minor annoyance is the tiny little 6" (at best) USB-C charge cable that Sony includes.  It's just simply not convenient to charge these headphones on such a short cord, and it really would've only cost Sony maybe pennies to include a more standard 3' cord.POSITIVES:(1) These headphones are very comfortable to wear, even for longer periods of time. They are just slightly less comfortable than the Bose QC35-II headphones, which feel like magical unicorn sparkle angel pillows on your ears.(2) A big thumbs up for future-proof USB-C charging! I haven't found any other brand of higher end headphone using it yet, so I suspect that Sony is the first.(3) The ANC feature is superb -- definitely equal to, if not actually superior to, the Bose QC35-II headphones.  And the app makes it even better by allowing you to tweak it to your personal preferences.(4) Another big thumbs up for Sony making the wired cord 3.5mm to 3.5mm rather than having a more proprietary (and difficult to replace) 2.5mm on one end.  Again, I'm pretty sure Sony is the only one doing this in higher end headphones for some reason.(5) Sound quality is excellent and in direct comparison I think it's better than the Bose QC35-II. I realize this is rather subjective, though, but I really have nothing negative to say about Sony's sound quality, whereas I felt the Sennheiser PXC550 sound quality was rather poor.(6) Sony put the right amount of touch controls and hardware buttons on these headphones.  One thing I really didn't like about the Sennheiser PXC550 headphones is that they didn't have a hardware on/off switch and instead the power option is built-in to rotating the ear cups.  That just seemed like something that would quickly break and I also never did figure out how I was supposed to turn off the headphones while still using them wired.  There's simply no way to turn them off.  Sony has a dedicated hardware power button, as well as a multi-function button that can be setup (via the app) to control ANC or digital assistants, etc.  So far I haven't had any problems with accidentally activating a touch function. Volume, skip, and pause touch functions have all been very responsive.(7) Although I'm not using the included case (I bought a 3rd-party case that I like better), it's still a really nice case.  I think the Bose case is nicer, but the Sennheiser case was just pathetic and wasn't much better than a bag in terms of protecting the rather expensive headphones.Overall, without getting into too many specifics about the other two headphones, I rate the Sony headphones as the best for me.  The slightly beat out the Bose QC35-II headphones in terms of ANC as well as sound quality, and there's simply no comparison when it comes to Sony's touch controls and superior USB-C charging.  The difference between the Sony headphones and the Sennheiser PXC550 headphones was like night and day. The Sennheisers had vastly inferior sound quality and horrible comfort to the point that I couldn't even really test/compare the ANC because there's simply no way I could keep the Sennheisers on my head long enough (the ear cups are actually painful).  It was also a nice touch that the Sony headphones came to me fully charged, whereas the Bose and Sennheiser headphones were only partially charged.  Who wants to wait to fully charge their new device?So, in summary, the Sony WH1000XM3 headphones slightly nudge out the Bose QC35-II headphones, whereas the Sony headphones obliterate the Sennheiser PXC550 headphones so badly that they really aren't even in the same category.
I purchased these headphones after seeing a lot of reviews online and because it was on sale. I couldn't help it. I've tested them for a couple of weeks now, and I think I can give a good review by now.They replaced my Bose QC25 headphones that I loved but that I wished to be wireless from time to time. Since I've used those headphones for years, my review is comparison between the two brands and is probably going to be helpful for people that are deciding between these and the Bose QC35 II (please note that every other headphone in this price range is just pale compared to these). Also, I don't know much about Bose 700 since I haven't tested them extensively, but most of the things that apply for their older version is probably true for these as well.The Negatives:----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Not as comfortable. They are very comfortable, but not as much as Bose. After a while I can feel them in the top of my head and I do feel the headphones in my ears. Bose are almost perfect here; I can use them for hours and hours and only get hot in the ears if the day is really warm.- A little loose. The clamping force is a little lacking. When looking down or headbanging you can feel them move around and even fall. I didn't have this issue with Bose.- Earpiece cushions harder to replace than Bose. After over a year of use my Bose cushions started wearing down until they finally broke. After a $12 dollar replacement purchase, I easily replaced them and they were as good as new. I don't know how much it'll take for these cushions to wear down, but when they do, it's going to be much harder AND expensive to replace (I've found the replacement cushions at $50 and I've been told they are not as good affecting the noise cancelling quality).- Single button to turn on, off and get into pairing mode. It's not a major issue, but having to press for two seconds to turn on/off and seven to get into pairing mode is not great. With Bose after a while you automate the motion of removing and turning of the headphones in one move. I've forgotten to turn these off more often than not because of that which of course impacts battery usage since they are on while they are still connected to a device. You basically waste hours of battery because of this. Pressing for two seconds might not sound awful, but it's that compared to a switch interaction of instant results.- Bluetooth management!!!! This is were this headphones are really poor compared to Bose. They cannot connect to several devices at once, and to switch you must somehow cut the connection with the other device. So, to connect to a device you had already connected to, you need to manage at least 2 devices but most often that not 3. You need to cut the connection from the headphones to the previous device (either turn off the device's Bluetooth or press the On/Off button for 7 seconds to enter pairing mode) and then grab the other device and connect them to the headphones. Bose products have a memory of connections, once connected, the device will remember and to connect to a device you only need to single press the Bluetooth button; the headphones will announce a device name, and if you wait the headphone will connect to the device (as long as it has Bluetooth on of course). If you deal with several devices at once like phones, tablets and computers, Bose approach is unquestionably better; if you only use one device or don't mind using the cord for the others, this is no real issue. For me, if I had known, it would have probably been a deal breaker. I just thought that Bose's way was the standard. Also... Bose products connect to 2 devices simultaneously.The Great and awesome:++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Sound quality! In general very similar to the QC series, but with better base. These sound slightly better than Bose which is an impressive feat. Getting either one of these headphones spoil you and ruin every other headphone.+ USB-C for rapid charging. It's great to know that little time of charging will allow you to use the headphones for a very decent amount of time. Probably more than necessary until there's actually time to properly charge them.+ Touch controls for Media controls are really great. That is way more comfortable than having to double or triple press a button to do a trivial task.+ Standard 3.5mm headphone jack!!!! It may sound stupid, but it's great to know that you are guaranteed an easy and quick replacement for the cable if needed. Cables should be able to provide even better sound quality than the best Bluetooth transmission algorithms. Weather that's noticeable with this headphones I don't know. But you can get a cord as long as you want for this headphones whereas with Bose you are basically stuck with the provided length since they use a 2.5mm jack.+ Outstanding noise-cancelling capabilities. Probably the best I've experienced so far.+ Outstanding Battery life! Batteries were never an issue for me with the Bose because I had 4 rechargeable batteries that I rotated fairly easily. The battery included with these headphones lasts a really long time (20 to 30 hours) so I don't usually find myself in the need of recharging them when I wanted to use them the most.+ I'm not going to continue describing good things, because that's what the product description is for.Hope this helps.

When I got my first Focal headphone last year, I was really impressed by the build quality, sound, and comfort of the headphones (Elegia). A couple months after owning them, I sold them to get the Celestee. The Celestee had the same characteristics as the Elegia.Build and comfort: Now, the Bathys carry over a good build quality and sound; the comfort is good but not great like on the Elegia or Celestee. The ear pads feel "cheap", and the headband is not as comfortable as the Celestee; there is a lot of pressure to the crown of the head. I will have to use these headphones during my commute to further test this as well as to test anc. If the comfort is not good, I will end up returning these.Sound: My first impressions were that they sound very similar to the Celestee (which has been stated by Focal already); however, the Bathys do have a bit more emphasis on the bass. The bass is not as powerful as I thought it would be; It is not head rattling. The audio quality is what you can come to expect from Focal.I am a big fan of the carrying case because it is much lower profile than the standard Focal carrying case.UPDATE:I stand by what I said about comfort. Comfort is not as good as the Focal Celestee. The ear pads feel more comfortable on the Celestee for my ears (I have big ears).The build is not cheap but it just feels like it given how small it is in comparison to Focal's full size headphones.The sound is really fun but the highs lean towards sibilance. Songs I used to listen to at a higher volume I have to turn the volume down. The highs get a bit harsh but everything else is fine. I imagine they did this so it can pierce through any remaining background noise the ANC doesn't cancel.Focal did a good job with their first high end wireless headphone (Focal listen was not high end and not up to their current standards). For the next generation, I would encourage Focal to make the headband a bit wider, prevent sibilance, have a true passive listening option, and improve on comfort. These headphones don't have a true passive listening option because the headphones need to be on to use them wired. This sets the same limitations that a Bluetooth headphone has but for wired. Although a nice addition, I don't think the built in dac is necessary as most audiophiles already one. If this is what has to be sacrificed to offer passive listening, then I wouldn't mind.Fix these issues and these headphones would be a 4.5 stars.
So, I am not audiophile or anything remotely close to it, but I have tried so many latest and greatest headphones, starting from one of my favorites Sony XM5, BW Px8, Senheiser Momentum 4, Bose QC earburds II, Bose QF 45,  Airpods Pro Max, Airpods Pro (1st gen), without using DAC, Bathys has the best sound quality and comfort level for me.  Px8 came next, very close and Sony on 3rd (I really liked Sony because it has a good sound with relatively lower price point), but Px8 was too tight for my head size and Sony's support for LDAC only and not AdptX was reason why Sony was not for me.  Only high-end headphone (well known) with ANC that I have not tried is Mark Levinson 5909 at this point.  If you have budget for high end, I highly recommend Bathys! If not, you have a small head Px8 is a good choise, if you are aiming 300 - 400$ range, Sony is probably it.  However, the sound is highly personal so I would recommend trying them if possible.
I received the Bathys today 11/8/22.  I plugged them with the USB-c provided and the sound is amazing.It is very clear and I can notice things that I couldn't with my old headphones.I have a problem and I may return them.  I have a big head.  I wear XL in hats, and the headphones barely fit over my ears.  It creates more pressure than any other because they are extended at the max.  It is not unusual for me to have this kind of problems, but I could wear many other headphones without the extra pressure.  My eyeglasses feel like they are pull to my face with extra force because the headphones.  I don't know if the pressure will be less after a period of usage.I will know more in a few days.================It is a sad day.  I will have to return the best headphones on quality, sound, functionality. They failed miserable in the comfort part.  They are too small, huge oversight by the manufacturer.  The pressure is high, and too small. It hurts my ears and the top of my head.  It does not cover over my ears completely, not because i have big ones. It is because they are too small.If you have small head, i fully recommend them. You won't be disappointed, but only if you have small head.
The sound is waaaaaaay better than "B***" brand leading model I owned. Much wider. Much deeper. Fundamental sound. As for wireless headphones it is a MIRACLE. No questions. You will be amazed. I was needed good sound and I've got THE BEST sound on the market.Noise cancelling probably as good as "B***".Didn't test them on airplane yet. No complains yet.
They sound incredible wireless and even more so wired. The cancellation isn‚Äôt amazing (can still hear people talking around me with max cancellation on) but it works as well as I would want. My only stipulation is that they leak sound quite a bit. Fortunately everyone in my office also wears headphones so it‚Äôs not an issue, but I would imagine it would be for some people.
These are amazing. Sound is perfect for hip hop, the bass is not too strong its just right. The build is great and you can tell its high quality. Its price is justified by everything. I use Qobuz while listening to music.
Great soumdConnecting to my phone took about 5 seconds.Amazing
Out of the box, the first thing I did with my headphones was to use them with the provided cable to listen to music. I was stupid enough to wear them when I turned the headphones on. What happened next was a very loud, high-pitched noise. It was deafening and my hearing has not been the same for hours. No button on the headphones fixed this problem. The only thing that stopped the noise was the off button, and it took several seconds for the noise to stop. I used an app to measure the sound volume, and it was over 95 decibels from ambient sound at 40 decibels. I can only imagine what the sound level was when the headphones were over my ears.Both I and my girlfriend tested this multiple times and nothing fixed the screeching. The Focal website does not offer any customer service without the hassle of creating an account.
Dead on arrival, high pitch noise on left channel when turned on (it sounds like mic interference going on). Sending them back for refund.There is another reviewer reporting same issue, with the small amount of reviews it doesn't seem like an isolated incident to me.It would probably be a good idea to wait a couple of months until these manufacturing issues get resolved before giving them a try. I have ordered a px8 B&W and wanted to compare features with the bathys to decide, it seems the decision was made for me. I won't give Focal a second chance at this time, 800usd is a lot for a pair of headphones with obvious quality problems.
Same as some user review here, the unit I received makes a loud, high pitch noise when turns on and can only stop by turning it off.

Judging by the majority of audiophile reviews of these on YouTube, these are well tuned, reasonably "detailed" with very average for the price "technicalities", mediocre build pair of headphones.I disagree. First, materials are awesome - great plastics, great headband, very hygienic, 7/10 comfortable.Pads are almost great - they lack like maybe a couple of millimeters of depth for my ears, though they're sewed smartly, and plush, and easy to clean.The adjustment and folding mechanism looks junky on videos, while in the real life it's sturdy, clicks are very precise, controllable, the joint seems sturdy.And these are very, very compact when folded - I carry them in my fanny pack, this is ridiculously convenient for a full size headphones.Cables suck, all three of them, they're like kings of microphonic effect, you need a replacement. Btw, choose Hart Audio cables, they're awesome.If it's hot, you need an AC in the room, since in 2-3 hours K371 will become hot and sweaty. Plus, since they slightly touch my pinna, I can wear them like 4 hours tops.And no amp is needed, you can drive them out your finger probably.Sound isolation is mediocre - I found it worse compared to Elegia and DT770.Ok, now sound.Out of the box AKG K371 sucks. Like a lot. It's like really bad. It's dry. It's low bass. It's shouty. It doesn't make any sense at all.But give them time. I don't know if that's pads burn-in, your brain's burn-in or driver burn-in and it doesn't matter actually. The fact it - that you need to run them on your head for quite a while to get to the point when they start to sound good.And OMG they change. I do have DCA AEON Open Flow RT, DT770 250Om and Focal Elegia, plus I have experience with many other cans and iems in very different pricing brackets.AKG K371 shocked me. I couldn't believe my ears.They're very balanced overall, mids are tight, natural, vocals are distinct, natural and well placed - not too far, not too "intimate".Brass instruments and electric guitars got some very pleasant bite.Bass is just how I like it - it's neutral. And yes, there is a very, very notable rise in sub-bass, but that's really much closer to how speakers sound in real life.Highs do not attract much of my attention, they're balanced. You can hear hits on hi-hats, you can hear a pretty ok decay on cymbals, there is nothing bothering me at any volume level (I'm looking at you, almost every other headphone I've heard).They're reasonably wide, way outside your head and there is a perceived soundstage depth, not to Elegia's level, but K371 is not flat at all in this department. Just place them kind of slightly forward on your ear and you're fine.Regarding the detail - I don't know, really. I don't feel that my planars or Elegia, both EQed to Harman and non EQed, are like more or less "detailed". I'd say I stopped listening my DCA AFO RT, that's for sure and I LOVED that headphone. Now AKG spoiled them for me and just can't.Elegia is still a thing of it's own and makes a lot of sense compared to AKG still. Elegia is the punchiest headphone I heard ever, it's textured and "physical" and no one else is close (I never auditioned 900MK2 or first gen HE-6). K371 is not flat, they're also reasonably textured, and that bite on brass is not available on Elegia, not to speak of light weight and portability of AKG. And the price.AKG K371 is better that Beyerdynamic DT770 250OM in almost every aspect. DT770 still got a ton of spare parts, a bigger comfy earcup and the stock cable is significantly better.I apply Oratory 1990 EQ to K371, but only up from 1KHz, changes are minor, but improvement is noticeable.With no EQ they actually do not sound "close" and with Oratory's EQ up from 1KHz they disappear slightly more. I know, right? No one was telling me that in any review.To sum it up. AKG K371 broke my 15+ years of audiophile experience. I'm puzzled, pleasantly surprised and don't know what to think.It looks as neutral FR is almost everything, with some place for speculation in punchiness and soundstage topics.I don't know. Like, buy these, try them out, give them time, be open minded, don't listen to overs, don't look at the price, be ready to change your opinion and accept that your previous experiences, opinions and spending stopped making any sense.I had a dream, that a perfect sound will become available to anyone sometime far in the future, but apparently that future is now.
After doing some internet research I found the K371 to be the right headphone for me, but curiosity got the best of me when I was researching replacement pads for it. Some reviewers claimed that the pads were different between the BT and none BT models, however Dekoni claims the same pad works for both devices as well as the K361. Turns out the pads are exactly the same, though the felt experience is a bit different on the BT models because of the thicker ear cups.Other differences to note:(1) Sound - if you weren't doing a side by side you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between how the two sound, however the K371 seems slightly more rich in classical and folk music and the bass is cleaner to my ears. It also sounded like there was a click or very brief rattle in the BT model when heavy base hit, such as in Vaishiyas song "Arped". This may have been a defect, or it may be the BT module adding to the dynamic sound environment in an unpleasant way. Additionally, I had a weird channel separation sensation in my ears with the BT model that went away after a few hours of play time.(2) Cable/Connectors - The K371-BT uses a 4-pin XLR connector for the cable whereas the K371 uses a more common 3-pin XLR. The 4-pin cable having more conductors in the wire is also more stiff and unpleasant, as you may be able to see in the picture. FYI - the K361 uses a smaller aux connector, probably a 2.5mm, which actually makes more sense for the BT model since the 2.5mm female end takes up less space than a 4-pin XLR.(3) Usability - The BT model is really convenient, and I must say I feel hesitant to return it, however I think I would take the cost savings on the K361 and the convivence of the smaller cable connector. If you're shopping for the wireless option between the K371 and K361, go for the K361 or save for a higher end BT headphone. For the wired, I must say I am enjoying the K371 and see no need to try the K361, which is a bit cheaper. Other notes on BT--the range is great and I can walk 50ft to the breakroom or bathroom from my desk at work and still have good connection. The touch controls are fine, not perfect, but I found them better than not having any. Sometimes it seemed like the BT connection would randomly degrade after listening for over an hour or so and when connected to Windows 10, but I didn't have that issue on Android.
The headphone is, of course, nearly ideal to the Harmon Curve... and does seem to be fairly balanced sound profile/tonality bass to treble. There does seem to be some elevation of response around 20 Hz from flat, but I wouldn't say they are really heavy bass.  Honestly given the price, sounds great.  After 3 weeks of wear, found them very comfortable for prolonged wear for me, with one minor gripe:  The headphone cable comes out of the left ear and points directly down. If I am sitting up and doing something else, I have no problem with it, but if I am relaxed and slouched back in my chair just enjoying, I find the strain relief of the the cable pushing against my shoulder.  But all-in-all good.
Where do I even start with the AKG K371. When you listen to these, it's like everything disappears, leaving nothing between you and the music. It's arguably the best closed back headphone that you can easily drive with mobile devices, like cell phones. The only closed-backs (headphones that don't leak sound everywhere) that are a significant improvement start at around 900 dollars, and you can only get the most out of them with a bulky amp, which cost a few hundred. For most people, this is as good as you'll ever need. And once you consider the price of around 150 dollars, it's arguably the best overall.Now the sound. Oh lord the sound. These are quite frankly, beyond words to describe. If you're going from crappy earbuds or even mid tier headphones like the ATH-M50, it feels like listening to your songs for the first time all over again. It feels like there's nothing between you and the music. As for the actual sound signature, it's one of the best tuned headphones period. The slight bump in the sub-bass adds a subtle but fun kick. The bass is impressively detailed and controlled. The mids are well balanced without being reduced into the shadow realm. And finally, the treble is detailed and fun but without being too bright. Overall, it's very detailed and the tuning is to die for. Soundstage is rather impressive, and although it's not quite the best in that regard, it's nonetheless great. Noise isolation is okay, not great but "good enough". Imaging (left-right differentiation) is very solid.These headphones excel at pretty much whatever you throw at them. I listened to a mix of Pop, Hip-hop, classic rock, metal, classical, electronic, jazz, synth, you name it. It's not just a jack of all trades, it masters then all. Gaming with these is also pleasant. I played Minecraft and Team Fortress 2 with these, and you have a pretty easy time discerning the direction of in-game sounds.Finally we get to the overall physical build of the headphones. This is where the only real flaws show up. Some people online reported QC issues, but they seem to be resolved at this point, and indeed my pair is fine. The top of the headband has some soft plastic imitating leather. This is actually a good thing, since it feels like it probably won't start flaking off in a few years. The inside of the headband is some sort of padded silicone material, which should make it real easy to clean. The headband adjustment mechanism is odd. It combines the function of adjusting the headband and letting the earcups rotate inward for storage. It's a little more loose that I'd like, making it hard to get an exact position while holding it, but it holds in place flawlessly once on your head. Fortunately, there's an easily accessible screw once you remove a soft pad on the inside of the pivot, so tightening the whole thing is no problem. the bottom part of this mechanism is made of metal. The earcups are hit and miss. They're comfy leather, but can have trouble sealing, especially with glasses. Furthermore, AKG does not seem to offer replacements on their website. I've found that Shure SRH1540 earpads function as a suitable replacement, albeit an expensive one. But I could not perceive any difference in sound between different earpads, other than an improved seal using the Shure earpads. The included accessories are nice, including the drawstring carrying bag. The cable is slightly microphonic (noise gets transmitted through the cable when you touch it), but you don't notice it at all with music. The cables themselves though (you get three, none with mic, just a 1m, 3m, and coiled cable, with a screw-on 3.5mm to 1/4in adapter. Having detachable cables is a very nice touch.So despite all the minor issues with the build, you might wonder why I'm still rating it 5 stars. Well, it's because they just sound that good. I couldn't recommend these enough. And for 150 dollars, it's a no-brainer.
NOTE: I have since switched to the AKG K371 (non-BT variant) and they resolve nearly every issue I had with these.These are an interesting set of cans. I'm just going to go straight into this analysis:- These headphones have a surface material that scratches VERY easily- they have an annoying mini XLR cable gratefully detachable, but it's 4 pinned, and very obscure to replace unlike the standard 3 pin mini xlr cable with the standard non BT K371. Additionally the cable itself is legitimately *very difficult to release via the button, and i have big guitar playing hands.- The hinge system is down right ridiculously stupid. It's designed to be "portable" (but this is marketed as a professional grade studio headphone so why??), and because of that they've redesigned a way to attach the ear cups to the headband, and unfortunately it creates a bunch of issues inherent to the entire new K-line by AKG (361, 371, and both BT variants). What are those issues?1. Well, there's a bunch of sound leak, because it applies excessive pressure on the top part of the cup and leaks on the bottom as a result.2. The physical cups are on an adjustment bar that is very sensitive to readjustments and often doesn't ever stay in place properly. It's so stupid how bad this works because remember, theres a big sound leak issue which SUBsequently leaks all of the low frequencies. So the only solution alternatively is a pad switch, or to adjust the headphones in a way where the ear cups and headband angle can *kind* of compensate for this. BUT THAT DOESN'T WORK SO GREAT WHEN THE CUPS READJUST THEMSELVES BY BREATHING ON THEM. Let's not even get into how dysfunctional it is without this sound leak issue. Trying to reinvent the wheel in total failure.3. The way the pressure is applied on the cup, it presses excessive force above the top of the ear, which happens to be where a small pressure point on the head is. So the result is a headphone clamp that causes mild headaches upon use. I believe as you use these, this clamp force is reduced as mentioned on headfi.org, but then I would imagine this effects the seal from the cups themselves, thus resulting in more sound leak.So these ups are just one big negative feedback.To add insult to injury, AKG designed the ear cups differently between k371 and the k371bt. The k371's are recessed differently, and as a result, the newer BT variant I'm reviewing are very, very close to the ears due to different and thinner pads. As a matter of fact, for me, with a regular shaped head and sized ears, MY EARS REST AGAINST THE DRIVER of the headphones. This is so unacceptable at this price point and for a "Professional Studio Headphone". I can't mix for more than an hour without severe ache and irritation from my ears because of this. They agitate unrelentingly, and this is the main reason I've decided to return them.The sound is okay.I myself enjoy the roundness of the low end, albeit a little bloated.The Bluetooth:-Can only connect to one device at a time.-limited Codec options make for commercial grade sound, but below average for audiophiles or "Professional Studio" use. I'm assuming this feature isn't intended for professional usecases.- The range I apparently VERY good! Which is a great surprise. There supposedly supposed to be about as good as Apple Air Pods, and better than just about every thing else tried by another user I've spoken with.- Controls are comically bad. They're touch, and I‚Äôd say anywhere between 15% and 20% of the time I can get it to work (.e. play, pause, etc). Volume control is as bad, if not worse for me. Closer to 10% of the time I'd say, without exaggeration.Finally, to touch on pad swap. I swapped to the perforated ‚Äúslanted‚Äù pad made by BRAINWAVZ and while I didn‚Äôt mind the original sound signature in it‚Äôs lows, this pad swap has created a much more balanced sound in the lows, while also making the signature much more interesting in the upper mids and treble. They add a little bit of pleasing air, scoop out some of the excessive fattiness in the sup bass, making it more shapely overall, while also, and to my great appreciation, reduce some of the abrasive mids that can come off ‚Äúshouty‚Äù in the original pad response. Finally, something that is definitely worth noting and praising that you did not mention, is that the perforated pads create a SIGNIFICANT breathe-ability in the ear cup with the cans on which is not only adding to the ‚Äúairiness‚Äù on top, in the treble register, but also helping tremendously with long recording sessions. Before, the stock pads would not only kill the ears with achiness and irritability, they would get VERY sweaty and hot in reasonable 1.5+ hour recording sessions. These new BRAINWAVZ perforated pads for the ATX line are substantially more breathable, which would seem obvious, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be this much better. Humidity never really exceeds 60% of what the original pads did after an hour and a half. And that is a huge difference. Also, on the subject of these pads and the ‚Äúon-ear‚Äù fit. They do fit kinda half on ear half off, because there is an inward slant that goes towards the inside of the cup. Now, I myself am sensitive to this idea, but for some reason it doesn‚Äôt feel noticeable uncomfortable or agitating. I don‚Äôt really know why that is but I‚Äôm very grateful.Conclusion:I like the sound, the fact that the cable is detachable, and the Bluetooth sound is actually pretty darn good compared to others. But, too many other issues. Sure, with the extra pads, 3, or even 3.5 would be reasonable IMHO. But with the number of fundamental issues like the stupid hinge design (Why are they adding ‚Äúportability‚Äù design to a studio headphone FFS?), and thus, awful sound leak, as well as very poor Bluetooth controls, the strange clamp force headache, and very poor ear cup design... These design flaws are so fundamental, that they‚Äôre inexcusable to me as a consumer And bear in mind my body dimensions are very average. Perhaps on the slimmer athletic side with normal head size and ear size. Not to sound harsh, but the issues are so  basic that they deserve to be highly criticized IMO.My final score would be 2-2.5 stars.
I bought the k361-bt versions, and I will stand by these headphones having an incredibly good sound. While they don't come with ANC and have a proprietary cable, the benefits of the sound alone are worth the money.Unfortunately, after about 2 months of use, the right ear cup suddenly gave out. I have been very careful with these headphones and generally place them gently because of the way it folds. But just today, as I decided to plug them into my laptop just for general use, no sound was coming out of the right ear. I'm afraid I believe it might be one of the wires being loose, as even in wireless mode it still has no sound coming out of the right cup.I still stand by it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a mid range priced pair of cans. Unfortunately I won't be able to appreciate them for a while now. I am absolutely devastated because these have beeny favorite pairs to go to for the past couple months.
Top quality sound but very little isolation.
I was never a fan of headphones until I bought this one. Because I needed to meditate using binaural beat audio files, I bought another so called "professional" headphone 3 years ago for $50. Although its bass is good enough for the low frequency in my audio files, I was never satisfied with its other respects of the sound quality. Then my old headphone broke so I needed to buy a replacement. I made the decision to buy AKG 371 based on its range of frequency response and its price.I never used any other headphones with sound quality better than audiophile class speakers until this one. I have a stereo speaker/amplifier system worth $600. Now if I make the speaker volume low, I should say the sound quality from my 371 headphone is better than sound from my speaker system. The speaker sound quality is better than the sound from 371 headphone only if I make the speaker system volume loud.The sound from the headphone is clear and rich, with all the frequency components from music. The bass is rich but not heavy and the treble is full of clarity. I am very satisfied with this headphone! Although the build quality for this headphone is not the top class, I cannot expect much for a headphone at a price lower than $200.Something to note for beginner audiophile listeners:1. You need a good quality DAC (digital analog converter) to fully realize the headphone's potential. Both my computer and my cellphone have HD DACs so they are good enough for me. You don't need to buy this headphone if you only have a very low end cellphone.2. Also you need at least high data rate MP3 files to really enjoy the rich details of the music. Probably you need at least 192kbps MP3 files. You don't need this headphone for 128kbps MP3 files.
Very comfortable for long listening sessions. Tuned to Harman frequency response curve. Great for most genres. Details, soundstage, and build quality are good for the price.
I got these in June 2021. Was surprised that they sounded so bright given that they have a reputation for being dark sounding but I didn't mind. I listen to mostly metal and rock, stuff with instruments and these were fantastic. Unfortunately the pads fell apart in about 8 months. I replaced them with Shure HPAEC1540 pads (a bit pricey but worth it. They don't change the sound much and are more comfy than stock pads). I was happy with this setup until the right side driver just up and died on me at the end of July 2022. I used them heavily (6 hours daily on average) but am very careful and took care of them as best as I could. I didn't get any shorting or anything before it happened. Just unplugged for the night, tried in the morning and nothing. Even opened it up to check for issues with the cabling and everything seemed normal. The driver was dead. I was very disappointed. Loved these things up to that point. So yea, great sound but they may die on you.I've since replaced them with Beyerdynamic DT 700 Pros and am happy again as the sound signature is similar but with improvements in the bass regions. The build quality on these and Beyer's reputation also inspire confidence in their durability.

I like everything about them. It only took a minute to figure out how to use them. The volume level is good. The sound is good. The noise cancellation was able to block out my lawn mower. I couldn't even hear my ear buds over the lawn mower. With these, I can hear without blasting out my ear drums.

I‚Äôve been wanting to try Bang & Olufsen headphones for sometime but the H95‚Äôs were just too much $$$ for me to justify the expense. However the newer HX‚Äôs were a $100 off their regular price so I decided now was the time to try them. I have tried numerous wireless noise canceling headphones over the last year and really liked a number of them but none were exactly right for one reason or another. I tried Sennheiser Momentum 3‚Äôs, Bowers & Wilkins PX7‚Äôs, Master and Dynamics MW65‚Äôs, Shure Aionic 50‚Äôs and still own the Sony WH-1000XM4‚Äôs and the AirPods Max. In my opinion the Bang & Olufsen HX‚Äôs are the best of the lot, overall, but aren‚Äôt perfect by any means but are very close. Longer battery life, excellent sound especially when tweaked with the equalizer in the Bang & Olufsen app and are super comfortable for extended wear. Noise cancelling is very good, not Sony level but close. To my ears sound better than the AirPods Max and so much lighter and more comfortable. One note on comfort is yes, the round ear cups are smaller then the rectanglular shape of the AirPods Max and will probably sit a little on your ears as they do mine, however the leather covered memory foam ear pads combined with the light but stable clamping force of these headphones make it a non issue. After 3+ hours of wear I was only minimally aware of them, they are that comfortable. They have a wear detection feature but I found even on the reduced setting it would pause music with the slightest turn of my head so I turned it off. I read longer hair (I do need a hair cut) can cause issues and a recalibration can fix it but it‚Äôs not that important to me at this time. As for the only other issue that will bother some is the touch controls are finicky for sure, the play, pause and swipe to change tracks works fine but the volume swipe around the cup is very difficult to get to work, at least for me it has been, but still not that big of a deal to me. I love the sand color with the gold accented aluminum finish on the cups which is eye-catching for sure. Only had them for less than 24 hours so can‚Äôt really speak about battery life as of yet but seems to be on par with what Bang & Olufsen claim. Sound quality is top-notch with a well balanced sound the you can adjust in the app to what you like. Bass is precise and pleasant, especially on the warmer side of the eq but not overpowering like some. It hits the sweet spot for me. Over-all these are my favorite headphones yet and I highly recommend them especially at the Black Friday prices! I may update later as I use them more and after I use them outside of the apartment. I‚Äôm a headphone addict I guess and I love these headphones!11/28/21 Update. The wear sensors work great as long as you calibrate them first: have the headphones on a flat surface, turn them on, turn in the wear sensors and then put them on. Once calibrated they work perfectly. I do recommend the ‚Äúreduced sensitivity ‚Äú setting. Also the volume slider works fine as long as you are swiping in the right spot inside the ring on the right ear cup. Battery life is as advertised! Love them!Update 12/16/21: Sadly, I decided to return these headphones for a couple of reasons: noise cancelling was not very strong and didn‚Äôt really block out much noise (especially on the bus commuting to work). The wear sensors worked when calibrated every time you turn on the headphones but when I had them connected to both my iPhone and iPad Pro they would always auto play music from my iPad no matter what I had been listening to prior to turning them on/off. Also the sound was very finicky, they sounded great for instrumental and jazz but other genres weren‚Äôt as great with either sharp highs or the bass would distort at higher volumes (even after the software update was supposed to fix this issue). I was constantly having to adjust the EQ to find a good sound that wouldn‚Äôt sound great across all songs. I really wanted to love them because of the premium design, materials and good looks, but in the end decided they weren‚Äôt worth the high price. Went back to the Sony WH-1000XM4‚Äôs and am happy with my decision (strong sound and excellent noise cancellation).Update Again, 2/16/22. After purchasing and liking Shure‚Äôs Aonic 40 headphones, but not satisfied with their build quality, I couldn‚Äôt resist purchasing the B & O Beoplay HX (this time in Black Anthracite) again and I‚Äôm so happy I did. (What was I thinking returning them?) the build quality is first rate, super comfortable (despite the round ear cups which do sit on my ears a bit, but are soft and really comfortable even for long periods) and the sound quality is the best over all that I‚Äôve tested. I wasn‚Äôt impressed the first time with the noise cancellation but upon this second listen realize it is better than I gave it credit for and slightly better than than the noise cancellation on the Shure‚Äôs. Once you find the right spot on the unusual eq in the app the sound is kind of unparalleled. The only issues I have found is the wear sensors don‚Äôt always work so I turned them off, and the multi-point connection causes some unwanted functions like automatically playing from my iPad Pro even if I was listening on my iPhone last time they were connected. (Auto play not an issue with the sensors turned off anyway). Also, the touch controls are finicky but I‚Äôve found most are.  Not deal breakers for me. I revised my rating and now highly recommend the HX, particularly at a discounted price (they are pricey, but you get what you pay for, as they say!)
I‚Äôm not an audiophile. My AirPods stopped working so I decided I wanted to try on-ear noise canceling headphones with a long battery life. My primary intention is to use them for work calls.I ordered the Bose QC45, very happy with them (I should also mention I was happy with the sound from my basic AirPods before). Except I couldn‚Äôt wear them for longer than an hour because my ears would start profusely sweating??? I googled this and turns out it‚Äôs a thing! Some people get hot ears from the synthetic material of the ear cups.The main reason I ordered these was because of the leather ear cups. It worked! No more sweaty ears. My ears are bigger than the round part, maybe that‚Äôs why, but I still find them very comfortable. Given the ‚Äúlack of seal‚Äù I find the ANC to be fine for my needs.One thing I find annoying is that to put them back in their case, you have to slide the sides back in. They slide smoothly and aren‚Äôt notched. So basically, every time I take them out of the case I have to readjust them when I put them on, and since they‚Äôre not notched as you slide the sides out I find myself readjusting a few times.The other thing - I was getting frustrated connecting these to my windows work laptop for video calls, but then I remembered there‚Äôs an audio jack in the case so now I just use that with no issues. I don‚Äôt think they automatically connect to my iPhone like the Bose ones did, but that may be user error. It doesn‚Äôt seem like you can easily go between devices like I can with my AirPods from iPhone to MacBook. I didn‚Äôt find the app to be intuitive for this either. Hopefully I‚Äôll eventually figure it out.Lastly, I did find that these needed to be broken in - I didn‚Äôt know that was a thing, the Bose ones didn‚Äôt. Right out of the box, music sounded like it did with my AirPods. I played with the settings, etc. For my needs I didn‚Äôt really care, I just wanted my ears to stop sweating. Then one day I was listening to music and the sound was much more impressive.I ordered the sand color, but in hindsight I wish I had gotten black. The case is light grey for these and I‚Äôm concerned about staining over time if I‚Äôm not super careful. Subjective, but I think black would probably also look more sophisticated on video calls. Overall I‚Äôm very happy with these!
I will say these are a very good set of headphones. Not perfect. But good.I'm just not having the issues I've read in a few bad reviews here. Everything works fine on mine. Volume control, next play swipe both work fine. The noise canceling is satisfactory to me. I know there are some that may be better in that department. But they are good enough.The other high points about these are that they are very light and comfortable and after hours wearing still no issue hurting my ears or feeling heavy. They completely seal around my ears making for a truly great experience.The very long battery life is a major plus too.I've owned good headphones that only last like 4 or 5 hours and that's a deal breaker for me because I wear them all the time.Now I own numerous pairs of headphones and my Master and Dynamics mw65's are quite good too. Especially if you hook them up through an audio cable and it really increases the sound quality like 10 times better than the Bluetooth function on that pair. That's really the only way I use them. They also are a little heavy and don't make a perfect seal around the ears. But I am curious on how the new mw75's, that Master and Dynamics just came out with, sound like and if they've increased the sound quality in Bluetooth mode.Overall after about 10 hours of break in on  these B/O HX's, they sound very well. They do need a break in period.I know that everyone might not agree and are picky beyond belief, but these are worth the money. High quality build and sound. I definitely would buy again.
Very Impressive set! What stood out the most was the build quality and sounds - top notch!! Some quirks, listed below.1. Sound: OMG amazing. The finesse, the quality of sound is the best I have heard. The experience is exquisite, in that you can really pick apart instruments, vocals and mids and the bass. The lows are balanced and refined - this is not going to rattle your head, so bass head stay clear. These headphone really shine for any genre that emphasizes vocals and instruments. Volume does not get crazy, probably a good thing!2. Connectivity: Top notch, power on and instant pair. Multi device use was seamless, pause on one, easily play on the next device. Pulling connection from a third device to a paired one was a also quick.3. Build & Comfort. Excellent build, feels premium and great in the hands. My only issue was the ear cups being round and not accommodating the largish ears. Clamp force was just fine as well.4. Features: ANC vs. Normal - barely any difference. Touch controls for volume took some getting used to. Would have much preferred physical buttons.5. Call quality: sub par compared to other.Returned these with a lot of hesitation, if it physically fit me properly I would have kept and overlooked the quirks.
Sadly returning. I really wanted to like them. I love the brand and own four of their Bluetooth speakers, more importantly for years I enjoyed very much the H9i. Sadly I haven't enjoyed their new line of headphones.  I bought a pair of H95 then returned because they are quite uncomfortable, I believe this is primarily because of their excessive weight but excessive clamping force and shape of the ear pads aren't a plus either.Disappointingly not much to be excited about their sound, moreover costing just about the double of everything else out there, to possibly offset the discomfort in wearing this $900 pair of headphones.Too much disappointment for too much money.I really wanted to continue to wear the beautifully built B&O so I ordered the HX. Now I'm back in H9i territory. Very comfortable headphone built with high quality materials and with a stunning look.However while they sound better than my old  H9i and have a much improved noise cancellation circuit the HX can't compete with the incredibly refined sound of the cheaper and ultralight weight Sennheiser Momentum 4 nor with their even better noise cancellation feature.I really hated the idea to return the stunning looking HX but the sound of the Momentum 4 is so superior  that the far superior aesthetics of the HX was not enough to win me.
I've had the B&O headphones for four months, use them daily.  Their all-around performance is great. Noise canceling is very good, sound quality is very good, bluetooth range is very good, comfortable for all-day. Long battery life!
For the price you pay, it's annoying instead of comfortable!First, it's impossible to have it for a long time. The headphone is heavy and you want to remove them for a while. Second, ear cups are round instead of oval. As such, it feels weird around your ears.The sound quality is good and volume control is super easy. I had no issues with connections or noise cancelation. Overall, if I could I would return it (I did not use it for three months and I did not have the opportunity to return it anymore)
Solo puedo decir EXCELENTE¬°¬°
Pros:- Very high quality materials- Beautiful design- ComfortableCons:- Volume control unusable for me. After several hours of practice I still couldn't control it reliably or oftentimes at all.- Sound quality very disappointing. Not awful, just not nearly as good as I'd hoped.Deal-breakers for me on any headphone or earbud are shouty, sibilant treble and fiddly controls. The HXs suffer from fiddly controls. I could swipe forward and back pretty reliably, but volume control was well nigh impossible for me.The sound quality was warm and smooth, but it really lacked any life at all in the top end. I know I'm fussy; first I don't want shouty treble and then I say I want life and liveliness in the top end. Well, I want what I want. For reference, my AirPods Max have life in the top end, which only ever overpowers me on poorly-mixed tracks. Ditto for sibilant consonants.I gave the HXs a go because I wanted a better wired option than my AirPods Max or my Jabra 85h for listening connected to a DAC. The Jabras have a very good sound, but Apple Music Hi-Res lossless and TIDAL MQA expose a thin-sounding weak spot in the male vocal range that gets annoying after a while. I'm looking for something better. I know the Jabras and the HXs are primarily bluetooth headphones, but I wanted something that could be wired for Hi-Res listening without jumping into the deep end of the pool of audiophile wired headphones.I'm returning these for the (essentially) broken volume control design.
The sound quality alone is worth the price. However, I was not expecting the noise cancellation to be as amazing as it is. Even if I am not listening to music, I can turn the headphones on and cancel out noise from my bustling office. So comfortable and easy to wear all day long.

Best headphones ive ever owned. And i have bought and reviewed quite a few.My previous favorite headphones were the sony mdr-1am2 which were lighter and more portable than these mdr-z7m2 but the sound signsture is better on the z7m2. The z7m2 are WAY more comfortable but heavier, however they have good solid clamp over your ears so they stay in place and the cushions so soft, you forget you are wearing them.  The 1am2s can work well with cell phones and are loud (16ohm) but these z7m2 are quiet on cell phones due to needing more power to drive them (56ohms).Both headphones are considered closed back. The z7m2 leaks more aound than the 1am2s, but significantly less than an open back headphone like the hifiman sundara whoch is an open back headphone.Sony shoots for a neutral response. Meaning bass is flat, mids are flat, and treble is flat. A speaker will perform a certain way based on the housing its in. So far, these z7m2 are my absolute favorite and with a 70mm speaker/driver, its one of the biggest on the market. The highs are crystal clear, the bass can thump, and the mids are nice and warm. On the comparison side, the hifiman sundara are extremely bright (8khz is blown up by like 8db) and lack bass. However both headphones you can add bass with an EQ if you are in the mood to shake/vibrate your head. In fact, all 3 headphones I have mentioned can handle extra bass if you were so inclined. Some brands of headphones lack bass and you cannot eq more as the speaker itself will make mechanical noise, headphones like sennheisers in the same price group, audio-technica, and other cheap off brands. They just have no bass to begin with and you cant eq more. The Sonys are just, eargasm to me.There are multiple kinds of headphone users. "Audiophiles" who are snobs and honestly HATE neutral reaponse. These people prefer smooth mids and ultra bright ear shattering highs while completely lacking bass. Reminds me of old people shaking a cane saying "turn the darn bass down." If you were to look at a graph, the bass has serious roll off (negative, below center) while mids are flat and highs slightly above neutral flat. Like most sennheisers, audio-technica, hifiman, etc.Then you have those who want purity. Also a bit snobby (i can admit im a neutral snob) I want headphones to give me accurate representations of the music, how the person who created it wanted us to hear.... Which means flat bass (not lacking but not too much) flat mids and most importantly flat highs. If you were to look at a graph of frequency and reaponse the line will be as flat as possible. Sennheiser hd800s break the mold and end up in this catagory, but also are extremely expensive. Also Sony's lineup so far (1am2, z7m2). I want to get my hands on the z1r, but thats a long time from now if ever.V shaped people. They want heavy bass, flat mids, and harsh highs. The heavy bass requires harsh highs in order to overcome single speaker issues. A speaker playing heavy bass cannot produce accurate highs. It just can't. Thus the V shape. Not many headphones are V shape. Sony have xtrabass headphones and while the bass on a graph would be above the neutral flat line, the highs roll off and are lacking. Some of the more expensive xtrabass could fit the V shape ideal. Bass heads love these headphones. Similar to beats headphones by dr.dre....Then the mid lovers. No bass, no highs, but amazing mids. Aka the vocalist. Very rare, generally these people dont like music as a whole, and prefer heavy vocal music where the voice is the key feature. Also those who like podcasts. I dont have any examples of this because I dont have any that fit the bill in my headphone arsenal.So which are you?
They look and feel very well built, and are quite light for size.The soundstage is very good for closed headphones.The bass packs a punch, it's fast and dynamic. The mids feel a bit lagged compared to the other frequencies and perhaps because of the excess of bass is that I feel that they lack a bit of clarity.I would like to hear a little more information on the treble, don't get me wrong, the sound in general is very good, especially for long time listening, they have a relaxed sound that will allow you to listen to them for hours and in a very dynamic way that you will undoubtedly enjoy.But if you are looking for excessive detail in your music with a lot of information, these are not the right headphones for you.That said, they are my favorite headphones for listening to Trance and House music.
I have the original MDRz7 and these are a good upgrade. They managed to make the sound more transparent in the mids and highs compared to the last version. I had the top of the line Z1's but I returned them because they were hard on my ears. I also returned the Focal clears and Mr Speakers Ether C. I currently own Hifiman HE6SE which I drive off my SET tube amps and the Edition xx which I use with my Aurender Flow dac but lately I've been using the Sony MDRz7 mark 1 because I like the stronger bass even though the highs were slightly veiled compared to both my Hifiman phones I own, so I tried these MDRz7-M2 and they really improved the upper frequencies now comparable the Edition XX phones but with much more Bass that was too excessive and loose making the phones vibrate annoyingly on my ears. I discovered that this was caused by the new pads which I don't like so I swapped them out with the Z7 mark 1 pads and the bass is much tighter and better and I am happy now. I also own the Audeze LCD-XC and they are good however they cant be played as loud as the Sony nor is the sound-stage as wide. the Audeze cost $1200 and are heavy so the Sony's are a bargain especially when you swap out the pads, which I recommend doing. I enjoy the Sony's the most out of all my headphones.
Good sound that is characteristic of Sony's style, easy to drive (phone, laptop, etc) and very very comfortable overall.  My two main issues were:1)  They leak a lot of sound for being closed backs.  Not a huge deal... but definitely something to think about.2)  The deal breaker for me was there not being a reliable way to replace the pads.  On the Z7 mark 1's and the Z1R's, you can just twist off the pads and replace them. On the 1A series you can just pop off the ring.  But on the Z7M2's...?? I dunno.They definitely don't twist off despite that being how it's done for the Z7 and Z1R... the rings dont seem to pop-off either. I double checked the b instruction manual.... nothing.  It does list the pads as a part, but no info on how to change them.  Ok, so I tried looking around on YouTube and audio forums for a tutorial..... no luck.Next I contacted Sony about how to replace the ear pads.  They told me to contact their servicer, United Radio.  I contacted United Radio and they said the b pads aren't serviceable, and they would have to swap them out for a whole new unit if under warranty.......  What??At this price point, the pads need to be user serviceable, just like they are on the Z7 and the Z1R.  I have no clue why Sony decided to change that for the Z7M2 when it's based on those two models.
I was in need of closed back headphones and although I had tried the Focal Stella's and loved them $3000 was not in my budget.I have owned plenty of sony Headphones and build quality was always an issue but these are built wonderfully.The sound seems to get better the longer I use them .With the 70mm drivers I thought the bass might be bloated or slow and that was not the case .Easily my favorite Headphones and definitely worth the price except now I rarely pick up my Sennheisers or Grados .The pads are replaceable you just have to remove a screw then twist
These headphones have a built in DAC and I‚Äôm able to get full hi res music (24bit/192kHZ) from my iPad Pro‚Äôs downloaded Amazon HD music. You will need a wire to connect the headphones to your iPad Pro. With Bluetooth only (no wire) you will get slightly better (24bit/48kHZ) than cd quality sound.
Such a solid build.. very comfortable. Sound is nice.. doesn‚Äôt blow my socks off.. first thing you will notice is soundstage.. however the more power you throw at it the better it sounds. You need at least a solid watt
These headphones were a great investment for my studio work and personal listening. They are 3X what I have paid for headphones previously, but worth every penny.
Cable too long! Good sound though over-priced.
Nice but too much bass for me

The headphones work but won't stay inside the port on my 8 yr old sons school laptop. Of course, his teacher didn't mention any problem to me since the beginning of the school year so now I can not return for a refund. His teacher recommended this brand too. Any chance on getting a replacement?
I listened to music on my phone, I also use it for recording on my phone, TikTok, YouTube...And the wire is already going in and out, I can only hear in one ear  unless I wiggle and manipulate the wire chord connection...And it won't stay.  I've only had it around a month or two...
They aren't great, and definitely not bad.For the price, I recommend them.  The mic pics up ambient noise to a reasonable level.Works on my mac.Pixel 5... They work, both mic and audio.  However, calls would randomly disconnect when it's plugged in.
Exceeded  my expectation.
Great for school use
The product came and broke 2days later

The sound quality of this Headset is good and no one has ever complained about not being able to hear me through the microphone. However, the comfort of these headphones really starts to bother you after wearing them for more than about 30 minutes. I am in online meetings most of the day and my ears are hurting throughout the whole day until I take the headphones off for a break.
The left ear keeps going out. There's no rough handling of the item.  As I was recording the left ear just faded out.  This is the second pair I bought. 10/31/22
Was just what I needed

I used these on a 4 hour flight from Utah to Florida and they worked pretty well at lessening the ambient jet noise but not eliminating it.  There is a switch on the right headphone where you can turn the noise cancelling feature on and off and there was a noticeable significant difference.  My guess is that higher priced headphones üéß  would do much better but for the price these were a good value.I wish they were larger and totally surround my ears instead of sitting on top and pushing on my ears which caused my ears to nearly sweat plus if they surrounded the ear rather than pushing on them they would be more comfortable and probably better at noise canceling.They also use 1 AAA battery that supposedly lasts 68 hours.  I wish it was an AA sized battery that would last longer but would require a redesign because of the larger size but if the earcups were larger this would solve 2 issues.
I bought these headphones for my father.  He uses these headphones with his iPad as my mother listens to TV on volume 35üò´
impressively noise cancelling, great sound, and stylish as well
I bought these to drown out the noise from a loud air conditioner and PC fans in a small room. They definitely cancel out almost all of the surrounding noise, so I can hear my music, games, YouTube videos, class material, etc. very clearly. You will always want to have them powered on, as the sound quality is pretty poor when the power switch is off. When powered on, the sound quality is surprisingly good - not the best I've heard, but more than acceptable given the price. Bass is nice and deep, highs are clear. The cord is a tad short, so don't think you'll be moving away while you're wearing them at your desk. Overall I am very happy with these headphones.
I bought these headphones to replace an older pair of Sony headphones where the foam covers had begun to peel off. They fit well and feel comfortable. My ears are not sensitive enough to judge the sound quality, but I had no problems hearing the sound. I would guess the noise cancelling works well as it, at least, muffled the sound of an air conditioner nearby.My only complaint is with the length of the cord. I bought these wired headphones specifically because not everything I would use it with has wireless capability. The cord would do fine with a device that I held in my hand or on my lap, but I also want to use it attached to a desktop computer. In this case, I found it hard to use the keyboard, due to the shortness of the cord. I measured it against the old set's cord and found the new set's cord is about 18" shorter. I will need to get a short extension cable to use it with the computer.An additional note: had known or realized that the foam covers could be replaced, I would have bought the available replacements, rather than a new set of headphones.
I purchased these on Prime day. Used them on a flight and found the right side had very low audio. they were returned and refunded
For the only spent on this headphones you'll get a decent result. The sound quality is good/normal (I am not an expert in describing or identifying the characteristics of sound).As of the noise cancelling, they definitely cancel some of the ambient noise (maybe up to 50% of what is achieved with more expensive and top of the line noise cancelling headphones).
Fits perfectly and comfortably. Wires can be a little annoying sometimes.
Ok for the price.  Not great at noise canceling, ear pieces do not fit well.
The headline says it all.  I'm not an audiophile; I'm a regular 60+ year old guy who planned to use these to listen to music, podcasts, youtube, and/or the occasional streaming movie.  For me, the sound quality was clear and decent. I had no complaints on that front. The noise cancelling feature does work, but it won't silence anything louder than an oscillating fan. That's all the good I can think to say.For the rest of the story; they feel seriously, painfully cheap. Hard, machine punched plastic slapped together with small, also plastic bits.  These feel like they wouldn't withstand any length of time under the gentlest care. Toss them around? Drop them?  Stuff them in your bag?  The earpieces would likely snap off the headband in weeks.There's a cord running from both earpieces - obvious from the photo's - but the set these were going to replace had one cord on the left ear, and maybe it won't be an issue for you, but I didn't like it. Personal preference, I suppose.I would have kept them longer to see how they aged, but my breaking point was the comfort, or lack thereof. There's not much padding and they're on ear, not over. I had to take them off after about 30 minutes.  It was more of an issue with the left ear than the right, but these were unbearably uncomfortable.

Good product for the price
I had a pair for about 5 years. I needed to replace the ones I had already. Great value for the price
Great for watching movies in full sound when everyone else has gone to bed. Also great for anyone with hearing loss. Gives them complete control of their necessary volume without blasting everyone else out of the room.
Bought These headphones when they first came out and I absolutely loved them! So ofcourse I had to get my hands on them again!!! I like to wear these while working out! They definitely cancel out noise especially a gym.
These were ordered for my daughter as a Christmas gift to replace her 3 year old ones.We are currently awaiting a  replacement pair because they broke within 2 weeks.
Great sound at a reasonable price
Like the volume button on these so I'm not always swiping
The sound quality is really good as is the noise cancellation these are really good headphones
The sound is awesome
DON'T LIKE THE SOUND, NEED TO TURN THEM UP TO HEAR THE VOICE , THEN WHEN SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS THEY ABOUT BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF, ALSO AFTER WATCHING A MOVIE WITH THEM I WIND UP WITH A HEADACH..
https://www.amazon.com/Philips-X2HR-Over-Ear-Open-Air-Headphone/product-reviews/B01N5VHLUG/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews
Intro: So if your wondering if these are worth it... they are. If you want more details on why then keep reading. If you want my opinion on a certain aspect of the headphone then scroll down to the paragraph over what you want to know about. I‚Äôve got them all labeled.Build: Overall these a built extremely well. There is a bit of plastic, but any part that‚Äôs going to be under stress is excessive built up with only metal parts. Unless your beating these with a bat I‚Äôd expect the electronics to give out long before something snaps or something. It feels very good in the hands. The only issue I have with the build is that they are extremely oversized. The top of the headband to the bottom of the ear cups is about 9‚Äù. It‚Äôll look oversized on nearly everyone‚Äôs head. That said I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal, because your not going to be wearing them out and about as they‚Äôre open back. So overall I‚Äôd give these about a 9 outta 10 for build as they‚Äôre built like a tank and look great off the head, but are oversized when your actually wearing them.Comfort: I gave these a 4 outta 5 for comfort, but that said, these things are stupid comfy. Most people will probably be able to wear these for around 6 hours straight without ear relief. I‚Äôm really happy with the pads. They‚Äôre ultra thick, lined with microfiber, and made outta memory foam (a material I love). It‚Äôs like having a pillow around your ears and will blow your mind if all you‚Äôve ever felt are fake leather pads. They‚Äôre so big around and deep that a lot of people‚Äôs actual ears won‚Äôt actually touch any part of the headphone. They‚Äôre also very light weight which helps. Now they loose a star due to their mesh hammock suspension system on the headband. This means that the headphone is always ever so slightly pulling down on your head with extra pressure. It‚Äôs very slight and it‚Äôs distributed across the entire top of the head but it does feel nice when you go to take them off. Also the clamp force is a bit tighter than I woulda liked to compensate for the mesh system but it‚Äôs not that bad. They‚Äôre still very good in the comfort department, understand I‚Äôm being very nit picky, but I‚Äôm sticking to my 4 stars, which translates to an 8 outta 10 for my rating on comfort.Packaging: Good enough. 10 outta 10.Parts in the box: Pretty simple. You get the headphones, some papers, a clip thing for managing the cord, a 3mm to 1/4‚Äù adaptor, and the cord which has 3mm on both ends. The cord is the nicest I currently own. It‚Äôs very thick and it‚Äôs got that soft weave around it. It‚Äôs never got tangled and is also excessively long. I don‚Äôt know how it could get much better. Im going to give the stuff in the box a 9 outta 10 rating, because I really would have liked a case of some sort, even if it was just like a soft case it would be nice to have something to store, transport, and keep the dust off the headphones.Sound: The most important aspect to any headphone is the sound in my opinion. So I‚Äôm a noob audiophile and this is probably only the 4th product I‚Äôve listened too that is actually hi-if quality. I ordered the 1 More Tripple Drivers to compare with these and sent them back as I preferred the X2s. The other headphones I own to compare these too are the Sennheiser 558s. I‚Äôve also heard a great speaker system. If your curious I was powering these off an Oppo HA-2 from my IPhone using MP3 files (I know, I‚Äòm scum to not use FLACü§ô).  Highs- It was quite good. The detail was equal to my 558s but the X2s the weren‚Äôt as impactful and organic sounding as the Sennheisers were. The highs were definitely better than the 1 More Tripple Drivers (over ears) although those were definitely better for cymbals. Overall clarity for like upper guitar and female vocals definitely go to the X2s. That said I don‚Äôt care very much about highs as I mostly listen to alternative an rock with mostly male vocals. If highs are a priority of yours I‚Äôd advise you to check out something from Senheiser, maybe the 58X, as they‚Äôre known for having great dynamic top end resolution from what I‚Äôve read and heard.  Midds: The midds are actually better than I expected. They‚Äôre not as recessed I expected from reviews and have good detail and clarity. Again my 558s definitely win over the X2s here as vocals and guitar chords hit with a lot more impact and there is slightly better detail on those to my ear, but it‚Äôs close. The midds are miles ahead of the 1 More Tripples as those sound quite a bit muddy from being closed and balanced in a lot more of a V sound than the X2s. So overall the midds leave some to be desired but are better than I expected.  Bass- So this is why I bought this headphone and is definitely what they do best. The bass and sub bass is most likely the best for the price period. It‚Äôs very clearand goes really low. What surprised me most about the base is how little of it there is. I‚Äôm not a bass head so this doesn‚Äôt bother me, that and my HA-2 has a bass boost setting which got the base to more of a level I expected. The 1 More Tripples had noticeably more bass than these, but the X2s was drastically cleaner and didn‚Äôt muddy the other frequencies thanks to it being open back. If your listening for the bass it‚Äôs there and you won‚Äôt be dissatisfied; but it doesn‚Äôt shove it up your neck like Beats do and ruin the music. Especially if you listen to songs where the base is well separated and distinct from the highs in the recording, the X2s will play it fantastic. Overall if you want the best bass currently under $150, look no further.  As a whole I give the sound 10 outta 10. Although sound is something that can always be improved upon, its sound almost definitely hits above its price especially in the bass department. Overall: I purchased this headphone as a fun headphone for the days I want a bit more bass than my 558s can offer. Not only do they fulfill that role in my growing collection perfectly, but they‚Äôre balanced well enough that I‚Äôd also recommend them as a stand alone daily driver for music, movies, games, and what not. These would be a great entry into Hi-Fi headphones if your new to the Audiophile world and would probably be the best headphones you‚Äôve ever heard. I mean they destroy any wireless Beats, Sony, or Bose headphones, even the $300 ones in sound. They can be driven off anything, so you could use them with a phone, computer, game controller, etc. If you want them for gaming I know that Sennheiser has a pair of gaming at around the same price that‚Äôs going to be better if your really competitive and only want to use them for gaming. But these will make gunshots and explosions sound cooler due to deeper bass and are much more versatile resulting sound better for music and movies. The X2s will sound better than any skull candy or consumer grade gaming headset. You can add a mod mic for about $30 for multiplayer games, but these will beat out or match just about anything besides more expensive audiophile products for single player games. As I said earlier, they‚Äôre great for movies again due to that bass which really adds energy to explosions and makes a soundtrack with nice deep dark notes sound sick. As previously mentioned they‚Äôre overall great for music especially if you want good bass although other headphones in this price range will beat out the X2s in the highs and midds. But considering overall quality, sound, comfort, and price; Id rate the X2s at around a 9.7 outta 10. They are really a great value especially as they‚Äôre price seems to be slowly dropping (it‚Äôs currently about $120 new) and even the most critical Audiophile is probably going to be happy with these for the money. If you made it this far thanks so much for reading. I hope my input was helpful. It really blows my mind that anyone would read all this so I really appreciate it. If anyone who read it is really experienced in the Audiophile realm, I would love it if you left a reply critiquing how well I reviewed the sound.I will probably update this review a good couple months from now once they‚Äôve been fully burnt in and I‚Äôll cover soundstage and imagery in that. Thanks again for reading what I have to say, have a wonderful day and go enjoy some music. üé∂ üéß
In the past year, I have gone through a long list of headphones and headsets. I finally, got down to two. The first, was the infamous, most talked-about, reviewed and beloved, Philips SHP9500. I bought them because I heard so much about them. However, they were discontinued for the longest time. Then, I got the Sennheiser HD58X Jubilee, which is very similar to the HD660 S. Those are definitely keepers. Then, I was hearing about the other superb, but more expensive headphones, made by Philips, which is the Fidelio X2HR. At its current price, I had to get them. I decided to add another set of headphones to my collection. Also, I was curious to see how they would compare to the SHP9500. Would the upgrade be worth it?DESIGN: Overall, the design of the Fidelio X2HR is basic, but kinda cool at the same time. The headband is made of dual-metal tubing, which is covered with a genuine leather strap with Philips Fidelio, etched on top. Underneath the headband is a self-adjusting hammock, made of breathable 3D mesh. The ear cups are made of plastic. In addition, the speakers are made of aluminum mesh, which resembles a microphone. The ear cushions are over-the-ear and made of a nice, thick and breathable velvet. While the velvet is nice and comfortable, they are magnets for lent.SOUND: The drivers of the Fidelio X2HR are 50mm, which is large. The frequency response is an outstanding, 5-40,000 Hz, which of course, is Hi-Res Audio. The impedance is 30 ohms. For PS4 gamers, 30 ohms is low enough for the controller to drive the headphones with the controller volume set to max. The maximum input power is 500mW, which is high enough to handle the power from a DAC or amp. Overall, the performance of the rivals my HD58X Jubilees, but is a bit better than the SHP9500. Give or take a few specs, between the two.I tested the performance of the Fidelio X2HR while playing various shooters on PS4 Pro and one on PS3. The first sound test was done while playing Call Of Duty Black Ops 4. The best map, which showcases the performance of the best is Nuketown. The sound from the Fidelio X2HR, gave perhaps the clearest and most authentic sound I have heard, while gaming. I have never experienced anything like this when using a headset or headphones. The bass is powerful, tight, crisp and detailed. Good sub-bass, as well. I would say, the clarity of the bass is similar to listening to a soundbar with a subwoofer. The treble is loud but heard with crispness and ample, clarity from all angles with no overwhelming, harshness for my ears. The lows, mids, and highs, are very balanced and distinguishable if that makes sense. Out of curiosity, some may want to know how the Fidelio X2HR compares to the SHP9500. So, i a nutshell comparison, the SHP9500 has inconsistent bass. The sub-bass is non-existent. The treble is good but can be a bit harsh. The lows are good, but not great. The mids rival the Fidelio X2HR. The highs can be a bit grainy. The imaging is good, but not accurate, as the soundstage is a bit airy.Back to discussing the Fidelio X2HR. Superb, tight and open soundstage. Great imaging. These headphones handle directional sounds, extremely well. With that said, I could hear the dialogue of nearby teammates, enemies, and other random sounds, throughout the map to the left and right of me with precision and clarity. I knew, EXACTLY, what was going on and EXACTLY, where the action was taking place on the map. It seems the sound magnifies toward when hearing sounds in a different direction. For example, each time my character looks in one direction, the sound increasingly amplifies in the direction and less in the opposite direction, where lesser actions were taking place. If my character, looks straight ahead, all sounds can be heard, equally. Of course, the fact that these headphones are open-back is the reason for this experience. The most impressive experience was hearing how loud and clear the explosions were, whether far away or nearby. Explosions gave a surprising, loud, clean, and crisp, sound.I must say, the Fidelio X2HR picks up subtle sounds with no effort, thanks to the headphones lows. Hearing shells hit the floor, coming from a blasting shotgun is addictive to listen to, strangely. On the Morocco map, outside of hearing the common sounds, during game-play, I could hear the subtle, clinking and breakage of pottery being kicked around, while traversing the area. I could barely hear this with other headsets, but in more abundance with the Fidelio X2HR. The unbelievable sound of crunching, as my character was trampling through the deep snow, cracking of the ice or sounds of moving water, while swimming on the Icebreaker map. Once, my character, Battery, ran inside of an open-ended bay of the Summit map. Battery was communicating, while outside and finished talking, while going inside of the bay. There was an echo of Battery's voice while speaking inside of that open-ended bay. The authenticity of the echo was unbelievable and nearly, scary. The voices of the characters, sound crystal clear. Of course, I am sure, some are wondering about footsteps. Well, the Fidelio X2HR picks up footsteps on Call Of Duty Black Ops 4, VERY well. I have been able to get the drop on enemies while ducking for cover and waiting on them to search for me.The second sound test was done, while playing Rainbow Six Siege, which is another outstanding game to test some headphones on, considering the nature of the game. Using the right headphones can be essential to survival. Anyhow, my character, Ash, sent the drone around the area. The White Masks could clearly be heard, shuffling back and forth, while crouched in cover positions, waiting to attack. Of course, this gave away their positions because of the sound, let her know exactly, where they were. Footsteps of roving patrols could be heard, very clearly. Plus, hearing how close and how distant he was from her position while taking his patrol routes. The White Masks could be heard, communicating with each other, while waiting in their cover positions. In addition, I could hear my character‚Äôs footsteps getting louder or softer, depending on movement speed. Knowing this, lets you know, when to move slowly, as your footsteps can also, be heard by the enemy. Breaching a wall was like, music to my ears. Not only was the sound of the explosion, impressive, but hearing the debris crash to the floor was impressive, as well.The final test was done, while playing Medal Of Honor Warfighter was a pleasant surprise, considering the game came out in 2012 for the last-gen, PS3. However, the game has DTS Digital Surround and Dolby Digital Surround, making for a good game to test. I was able to hear sounds, which I never heard, when I was last playing on a consistent basis, previously. The sounds were a bit louder than the other two games, which I tested, but clear. The directional sound is brought out the most when testing the while playing. For example, one of the AI teammates was firing an M249 SAW, during a gunfight. My character, Stump was getting fired upon. Therefore, he grabbed cover and happened to get next to his AI teammate. The gunfire was loud, which almost sounded like I was next to someone at a real firing range. Picture the sound of being next to someone, who is shooting a light machine gun. Anyhow, as I stepped further away, I did not hear the gunfire, as loudly. The attention to detail was unbelievable. The explosions from blasts of thrown grenades or breaching a door were loud, clear and very, realistic-sounding. Hearing dialogue from AI teammates was loud and clear. In fact, I heard the dialogue, which I had not heard, when I previously played a few years, ago. Small and subtle sounds were picked up, like a vacuum. I could hear them, clearly, whether stepping on some broken glass, a wood floor, a puddle of water or grass. Overall, I would say the sound test for Medal Of Honor Warfighter rivals the sound test for Rainbow Six Siege, which is impressive.MIC (OPTIONAL): An external mic, such as a V-Moda Boom Mic Pro will have to be purchased to utilize, while online gaming. The prices vary. I own a V-Moda Boom Mic Pro, but I have not tried this yet. I do know, with one attached, it should perform exceptionally well.VERDICT: Overall, the Philips X2HR is a great headset. For the past year, when constantly, hearing about these, I was wondering, if these were worth an upgrade over the beloved, SHP9500. Never in my wildest dreams, I would ever think Philips would make such outstanding headphones. Not to mention, the price was reduced to $148.99. With that being said, I would advise anyone looking for a headset to pick these up, just in case the price goes back up. Despite the praise, unfortunately, I reluctantly had to return these, as the headphones became heavy on my head after using. Not to mention, the sound, gave me headaches. Plus, the velvet caused the back of my head to itch. Still, they are superb headphones. They just are not for ME.
i am not an aduiophile so i don't know what's considered "good" but these are certainly good for me. i got these to replace my sennheiser hd 280 pros which finally stopped working after decade and a half so that's what i am comparing them to. i use them mostly for computer activities, including watching videos/movies, listening to music (heavy metal, rap, etc) and some gaming/chatting. just a little bit of everything.these came recommended to me from an audio enthusiast friend and i think these are a good upgrade from my old headphones. here are the things i liked/the reasons i went with these:- great sound quality. the most important thing of course. i don't know any technical terms but all my music sounds great/clear, the bass is good, voice calls sound clear.- comfortable ear pads. i almost went with the headphones my husband has but found the earpads too firm.-  removable wire. i highly suspect my old headphones stopped working because my dog knocked my headset off the hook by getting tabled in the wire one too many times. having the option to remove the wire for storage was a huge plus for me.some negatives and/or things to consider:- i do not care for the headband. it's one of those kinds that works on suspending the headset through an elastic band tension resting on the top of your head instead of clamping on the side of your head. i get a lot of headaches on the top of my head, so having the band put pressure at the top of my head makes wearing them for extended periods of time risk triggering a headache. it does get more comfortable over time but it's something to think about if you're sensitive about that.- the earpads are like a velvet material. very comfortable and soft but attracts dust and hair like crazy. mine is constantly covered in dog fur. tape will remove it easy but it's mostly futile since fuzz will collect again in seconds.- for some reason, these headphones are EXTREMELY quiet being plugged directly into my computer. they have a wider range when i plug them into my cellphone or into the headphone jack in my speakers, but just have very little range when plugged into the desktop itself. i fixed this mostly with some software (equalizer APO) but in general was little bummed that these needed extra help to sound correct.
I bought these as a replacement for my Sennheiser HD 518 which stopped working after 9 years, so that's the bias I'm coming into this review with.Pros:- Build quality is immediately noticeable.  The fit, finish, and material selection feels premium.- Comfortable.  I have a large skull, so some headsets clamp too hard, requiring months of usage to loosen up.  These fit well out of the box.  The use of a suspension headband is also nice because the padding won't lose its adhesion and fall off a few years from now (the one thing I actively dislike about Sennheiser headphones).- The detachable cable connects via a standard 3.5mm jack, so you can use any standard aux cord you want.  This should be way more common for expensive wired headphones than it is.- Sound quality is mostly good.  I'm not enough of a headphone aficionado to go into a whole lot of detail, and I have significant high frequency hearing loss so my detailed opinion might not even be representative of your experience, but I can tell good headphones from cheap ones.  One thing I can say for sure is that the open back design greatly improves soundstage.Cons:- As a result of using aluminum and steel versus all plastic headphones, they're slightly heavier.- Bass performance is acceptable but not great.  Open back headphones inherently lose bass so I'm not expecting a physics-defying miracle, but these produce slightly less bass than my old HD 518;  It's slightly disappointing because these are about twice as expensive.  I use these with a Quest 2 for VR gaming, so bass and soundstage both matter to me.
So let me just say I've blown A LOT of money on audio gear over the years--especially on headphones. But this purchase was money well spent. Well.........that is after I returned the first pair. I was shipped a box of screws. I'm not speaking metaphorically here, folks. In lieu of the X2HR headphones, Amazon shipped me a big, heavy box of screws. I was like, "I read these headphones are big and heavy but can they be THIS heavy". I had been literally screwed.But I got a refund and my second pair are amazing. I own a few other pairs of wired, open back headphones--all of which were more expensive and are considered more "audiophile grade": Sennheiser 660s's, HiFiMan Sundara's, and AKG 712 Pro's. The others could be called TECHNICALLY better. I will say there is a better transparency to the sound whereas these have a certain amount of "noise" in the signal. But guess what? If I had to pick only one pair to keep, it would be these. They may have technical flaws, but they are the most enjoyable to listen to. The tonality and tuning of these is incredible. Nothing seems missing. The bass is huge, the treble is lively and if there are scooped mids I can't say I really hear it. Certainly not as forward and mid heavy as the 660's, but that's not entirely a bad thing as they can sound a bit congested as a result.Oh that brings me to the best part: THE SOUNDSTAGE.  These have the widest soundstage I've ever heard on headphones. They almost sound like speakers on your head. Very few headphones can compete with these in this category--no matter how much you spend. Apparently the Sennheiser 800s's also sound massive--but they cost literally 10x as much. (One of these days I'll probably be dumb enough to buy them anyway).Oh and comfort? The best of all of them. They are massive. Don't look in the mirror while wearing these. You look like a dork. But they feel like pillows on your head. The earcups are perfect.And headphones like this make me question whether expensive even means better. What about Audeze headphones? Focals? By the descriptions I've read, they are all very "warm" headphones with very rolled off treble. I would probably hate them. Even the 660s' suffer a bit from this--although they do sound quite good in their own way and are probably my second favorite pair. But if I put on a rock song I find guitar solos can just sound dull and uninspiring on them. If I put the X2HR's on and play the same track, the same guitar solo soars!After you get past the $200 mark, you get VERY diminishing returns from headphones I think. You could argue there's no reason to spend more. I was watching David Letterman's Netflix interview show last night and he was interviewing Billie Eilish and her brother (who both seem very nice--shame abut their music) in their home studio and it looked like they were both wearing blue Audio Technica M50x's. $150 headphones and they are millionaires.  And these seem to be the open back equivalent to the M50x's: headphones that rose from seeming obscurity to become massive hits.Hit that Buy Now button. Unless you hate great sound!
I purchased these to use almost exclusively with my PC.  Early result are not very impressive.  Compared to the pair of Koss KPH30i that I was looking to upgrade from, the sound is very muffled in both volume and detail.  A little disappointing seeing how the Koss are $30.Since they are both low impedance (KPH30i, 60 ohm, Fidelio X2HR, 30 ohm) and both high sensitivity (Koss 101db, Philips 100db), I'm not sure what exactly is going on.My motherboard is an Asus X570 Tuf Gaming and it made no difference when I used the front or rear audio jacks.  Maybe the Realtek audio circuit on the board is just not a good match for these cans.I did hook them up to my Emotiva integrated amp which has an excellent headphone section and the sound was like night and day. Excellent soundstage, detail, and they could be cranked up in volume with very little distortion. I mean they sounded outstanding.I'll probably get an amp/dac combo for my PC and give these any try since I know how good they can sound. I'll update the review then.Update:Thought I'd give these a another try paired with a Schiit Fulla. Yeah, the difference is amazing. The issues with the volume and clarity were immediately resolved.Gave them 4*.  The only issue for me is that since the headband is not adjustable, they can slide around on me a little. The sound though, is fantastic.EDIT:  09/27/22I am sitting at my desk listening and when I go to take them off, one of the screws holding the ring on the right driver snaps off.  Worse, part of it is still in the hole it screwed into so I am not able to even ask for a replacement so I could fix it myself.  FIY - the screws are plastic.  That's kind of baffling seeing how that would be a point of stress when taking then on/off or adjusting them.Very disappointing to have this happen on a set of headphone owned barley four months. I contacted Philips so I'll have to see if they will help me out with a warranty replacement.Final Update 10/04/22:After requesting an RMA from Philips, one of the things I was required to do was include the serial number along with a picture of it.  Come to find out that whoever Amazon purchased this item from thought it was a good idea to put a white sticker(s) over the serial number, effectively making a warranty claim impossible.  Makes me wonder if these headphones were supposed to be sold as a licensed Philips product in the first place.To their credit Amazon did issue me a full refund well after the return period was up.
I'd been looking to audition a decent sounding set of open back headphones to add to my small headphone collection. There's definitely a time and place for closed back and noise reduction headphones. However, there are also times when you want to add music to your personal space without totally isolating yourself from the rest of the world or forcing everyone around you to listen along with you. These headphones are perfect for the latter scenarios. Like any open back design they leak a little sound into the environment, but nothing noticeable at even short distances.I was attracted to these based on the high number of favorable reviews and their affordability. Since no two people interpret the listening experience that any headphone presents in the same way I knew that I'd be taking a chance. Fortunately, they lived up to their positive reviews and have found their way into my life and they weren't a budget buster.I know there is a newer model available but I'm sticking with these for a while because they are doing everything I expected of them.
I'm not an audiophile and have no sense of what is a good quality headphone. I've purchased these after seeing them on sale and reading reviews. For me, it serves it's purpose. I game often and play all genre of games and these suit my needs without any issues that I've noticed.The comfort level is top notch. I've worn these headphones for thousands of hours and have no issues on how they feel on my head and ears. They are light weight, and expand and fit just perfectly.The sound quality, well to my ears, is alright. I can certainly say that without an amp, the voice levels are very dependent on what you use them for (in my case PC gaming). An amp support would certainly put these cans to a much higher level than what your motherboard may provide by default. I'm in the process of combining a entry level schiit stack with these and I'm hopeful that I can get lot more out of these.They are not ANC headphones So you can still hear your surroundings depending on the sound levels. The only noticable and irritating issue is that, well, the ear pads do collect a ton of dust. The issue isn't that it does, because what electronic doesn't, but that it really is a pain in the arse to clean them up.Phillips has been in this business for a long time. Their products aren't always top notch, but they are consumer friendly especially on their price for the quality they provide. For those who are budget conscious, these headphones are an excellent option to have without scaling to audiophile enthusiast headphones.
TLDR: Please know that while these aren't the best cans in the world, they ARE a deal at $150 and if you are lucky like I was to get them at $115 new (also from Amazon!) they are an absolute STEAL.  There's no genre this headphone can't reproduce at an accurate and pleasing level and they have bass out of the box that few open backs can boast.  They snuggle your head and don't let go (comfortably, after a week).  They travel well and have a nice long, braided cord that rarely gets in the way (THANK YOU PHILIPS).  IF these were the last cans you could buy, you'll probably be happy to accept.For a more detailed breakdown:Comfort: B-.  As I said above, they snuggle your head comfortably after about a week of breaking them in - the clamp is a 'bit' much.  The headband itself is covered in some nice leather type material but it stands so TALL.  It's convenient to grab and sturdy if ya wanna throw it in your bag.  It's an auto-sizing headband and I'm not a fan; I like the ones I can manually size in.  Depending on hair day, the cups can slide up the side of my face and that's annoying.  Also, the velour can make me itch some days.  Other pads from other headphones do not do this.  Once you get them keyed exactly where they need to be on your head though, they're super snuggly and feel great, hence the B-.Sound: A.  Super accurate, dark, thumpy, rumbly, rich and a joy to listen to.  They aren't the MOST clear in the world but honestly I have zero complaints - the way this headphone presents music, it's harder to hunt for details through the sumptuous sound, anyway.  I can't see all the way to the bottom of every song like with some other cans but I rarely find myself even making the attempt.  Due to their low impedance and high sensitivity it's easy to get great volume, body and clarity out of these with almost any device.  Imagine a heavenly voice buoyed by the soft rat-a-tat-a-tat of the snare drums with some hi-hats sprinkled in, bass rumbling in and massaging your ears....if that sounds like what you're looking for, these will deliver.*Keep in mind these are open backs and other sounds will drift into and out of the cups.  I like this - I feel it adds ambience and positively affects the experience for me.  This may not be for everyone.**Notice I didn't say, 'bassy,' like so many other reviews.  This headphone isn't, 'bassy,'.  It has a lot of thump and rumble for an open back.  If you want, 'bassy,' look elsewhere.Accessories/Packaging: A.  I feel that Philips provided a great package for these.  The box is big and prominently displays the headphone on the front - they're proud of this!  The box was easy to open and only the headphone is sitting inside when you open it up.  The cable is snaked through a hole in the plastic molding the X2 sits in.  It provides all the things you need to use the X2, including the best stock cable I've gotten yet with a pair of headphones.  It's long, braided, detachable and easy to corral whether you're at your desk or in bed.  It comes with an adapter for 1/4" too of course.  It comes with a cable clip too but I kept it in the packaging.  It's simple but it's really nice and I can't find a fault here.Overall: A-.  This is a great headphone.  If all you want to do is get a comfortable, clear pair of open backs with some thumpy, rumbly goodness that can be driven by anything - this is it!!!
I'm a burgeoning audiophile (Shout out to Dank Pods) and got these to replace my gaming headset since I have a standing mic now and just... wow.50mm drivers make all the difference in the world and these are so comfortable that I almost feel like I'm wearing nothing at all wish is huge because I wear glasses and headphones send to press them against my head. I can't speak to the durability since I only just got these, but they do seem nice and sturdy on first impressionI cannot recommend these enough.

This headset has the capability to handle 2 devices at once, I use a computer and cell phone at the same time - it works well. Using the dongle caused problems with my compan'y's remote software.  It would bounce from working to not working just because of some sort of power save function I believe. Finally, over bluetooth, I get this issue where the sound fades in and out.  I don't know what this is.  It happens from my cellphone and from my computer so I know it isn't either of them since I own several sets of earbuds and headphones that do work with my devices through bluetooth and do not have issues.  It causes me problems when I am trying to concentrate on listening to others while they are attempting to show and tell with me. So anyhow, I was thinking of returning them since they are just at the 30 day window now, but I guess that will need to wait.
I didn't get this for X-Mas and Santa Claus did not deliver one to me. However, this is an amazing item that would be just as great as something I would imagine to be delivered directly by Santa Claus! It's expensive, but I feel like the build quality is there as long as I take care of it. I prefer the dual ear pads for business usage instead of those other models with just one ear pad. The weight of the entire headset is pretty light, maybe not as light as a single-sided ear pad headset but it's not heavy compared to one of those serious music over-the-ear style headphones. I would not wear this to the gym to workout, because I feel these might not hold tight enough against the head while you jog on the treadmill.Was able to connect the headset to both my PC and iPhone, however, I initially had trouble finding a way to switch between the two devices. I contacted their support team by phone and was able to get a hold of a team member. He explained that the company is still working on the latest version of the software. He advised that I download version 1.0 from and install that instead. Once I installed it, I was able to navigate to the "Bluetooth" section to Disconnect or Connect the device depending on what I wanted. It's a decent workaround while they work on the existing latest version of the software for iOS Bluetooth and PC USB connectivity.Battery life has been pretty fantastic so far, but I have used it only for a few days. Today was not too busy for me so I spoke using the headphones for a couple hours only. Left it uncharged all day (10+ hours) and when I pressed on the button to check battery life the digital voice said, "battery full". Not sure if this power status is true or not, but I guess I could leave it unplugged for a couple days to test? I'll leave it unplug for another day or so and if it still does not drain any batter then the digital voice status generated by the headset might be wrong.The headset feels comfortable wearing it for several hours at a time. I do feel a little warm around the ears after two hours straight, but nothing major (expected). It's a work headphone so I have not tested music or game. I have Sony headphones for those other types of activities.The mic is pretty awesome, it is clear and people have no issues hearing me. The background noise is held to a minimum. The boom mic is slick and swivels up and down, and you can wear it either side of the ear. It has a magnet that clamps to the top of the headset if you are not using it. SUPPOSEDLY you can mute the mic if you swivel the mic boom to the top....? I haven't tested it, but I don't care. It would be a bonus, but not important to me. I mute the mic by software or by pressing on the "down" volume button on the headset for a 1 or 2 seconds. The mute button on the headset works when you are on an active call, but it does not seem to mute if there is no active call going on.The busy light signal on the side where the mic boom is located turns on occasionally? I thought it only worked with Bluetooth, but one time I saw it light up when I just completed a call from PC USB connection to my VOIP system. Not sure why it was lit up, but I disabled it because it feels a bit gimmicky. I don't expect people to actually "know" that I'm on the call just by seeing the red circle light up. It's not bad though, I don't have any negative opinions about it.The USB to Micro USB cable that comes with it is long enough for me to connect and use with my PC. It's not super lengthy (slightly under 5 feet, between 1.2 to 1.5 meters?), but good enough to be used while you are sitting close to your laptop. Just do not expect that you can walk around your desk with the USB cable attached.One feature request would be to be able to view the battery charge percentage from Jabra Direct software? That would be nice if the headset's digital voice status is not accurate.Overall, I believe this device is expensive but it does seem to be of high quality material. The sound quality is excellent as far as conversation goes. The ease of connectivity is fantastic. The mute is easy to activate compared to other generic headsets. Highly recommended!Update (8/05/2019): I am giving this product a 4 stars instead of 5, because I just found out that the headset was down to 5% battery this morning. The software popped up a notification, but when I pressed the button on the right side of the headset the digital voice stated "battery full". I do not agree to be mislead on this information, so minus one star of an otherwise great product. It is still a recommended product, but I hope the battery does not short out in the near future.
Note that I'm using this mostly with Webex on a Win. 10 PC and via Bluetooth vs. the dongle that came with the device.Pros:Sound quality is great, both incoming and outgoingPairing with my Windows 10 PC via built-in Bluetooth was easyMute function works for me however Webex doesn't always detect (see below)Minor Cons:"Busy light" does not work for me at all - and when I turn it off manually, it comes back on by itself. Probably has to do with other apps that have access to the headset in the background.Also when I'm _not_ on a meeting and computer audio is not playing, headset makes 'bloodleoop' noises every min. or so - have no idea what this is supposed to indicateRE: mute function, the Webex setting to 'Sync mute button status on microphone device' does not always work. I've had experience where Webex says I'm not muted but headset says its muted. Be cautious :-)
I have a home office for my business.  I had a Sennheiser Bluetooth headset, but I junked it because calls would periodically deteriorate with static until I was disconnected.  The Jabra Evolve 65 works flawlessly.  It sits on the ear with a soft pad so it is extremely comfortable for long calls.  It came with a USB receiver I plugged into my Lenovo Thinkpad port replicator.  Consequently, the headset works well with Microsoft Teams and Zoom.  I recommend buying the Jabra Evolve 65 charging stand, it will support your headset and keep it charged.  Only downside is the non-user-removable battery; eventually the headset will probably have to be replaced, but I have no doubt it will last several years.  In sum, it was well worth the investment.  I also have the Jabra in-ear bluetooth headset which I use in the field.  It also works very well.  I have a healthy respect now for Jabra quality and design.
The most amazing headset. I'm on calls about 7 hours a day, and this headser does not hurt my ears at all. Sound is clear, easy to use and pack for trips.After 2 and half years, ine side broke, hanging by a line, I superglued, worked a few more months and finally gave up. Noneoftheless, I just bought a new one. I've tried at least 10 other types and none are as good as jabra.
I had to buy a second one. I do all my work from the coffee shop and am frequently attending meetings online. I tried all type of high end ear buds and headsets, looking for one with the best noise cancellation mics so those on the other end will not hear any noise. This Jabra is by far the best for that purpose.The headset does not fit tight so I frequently have to adjust it, and I still hear some background noise. But as far as those I am meeting with are concerned, I am coming across loud and clear even though music and noise from the coffee shop is all around me.Also, after about 1 year of use, the handle just broke! But I still went out to buy the same Jabra, because I still work out of the coffee shop!
Sound quality is fine for a VOIP headset. Voices are a robotic but come through clearly. For media, the sound isn't great... it'd be fine for background music, but isn't great for more focused listening as the quality is so so.Comfort drops off after prolonged use; if you're on one call and then off and can take the headset off it's not bad, but it gets a little uncomfortable after more than an hour or two.The Mic works great for Teams and calls via my cell, however Google meetings has very low volume with it.The battery life isn't bad. Not as impressive as I'd expected, but last the day on heavy use or a couple on lighter use.Build quality is light but seems a little flimsy, so issues so far but I'm just a week into using it.BT connectivity and range is good.Overall I don't feel it's a great value at one fitty US; I've had lower priced headsets with better comfort and performance, but we'll see how it holds up.
Been using this Jabra Evolve 65 UC headset every day for nearly 2 months now and I am very satisfied with it, both as a UC headset as well as general use headphones.For the last year my home PC has also been my work PC due to Covid WFH situations so I have it a co-mingled mix of my personal apps like video editing software, sound mixing software, and general use for watching Netflix or YouTube, and work apps like my Fuze softphone, Teams, Skype for Business, Zoom, and WebEx.  I've also paired this headset with my cell phone for hands free calling.  I've been really happy with how it performs in every case and can't think of anything that has been a major disappointment.The sound quality is quite good.  It's not $300 Bose quality but it is still enjoyable for casually listening to music or watching a video with no annoying qualities like tinny highs or muddy or lackluster bass.If I had to pick one weak spot it would be that the headphone part is passive noise cancelling, which just means it has foam cushions that cover your ears and blocks out some noise.  It works pretty well for ambient noise but I share an office with my wife and we are about 6 feet apart and when she is on a call I can hear her very clearly while wearing these Jabra headphones.  That said, I knew they were passive NC when I bought them so I can't fault them for this.The mic, on the other hand, does an EXCELLENT job of rejecting most any sound that I don't make.  I'll be on a call with my immediate team and my wife is being particularly animated on a call and I'll ask my team if they can hear her and everyone says they can't but I am loud and clear.  I'm quite impressed with the noise cancelling of the microphone on this Jabra Evolve 65 headset.  I've used them for voiceover work with my video editor and the mic sounds great there too.  Another nice thing is the headset has a built in mute for the mic.  I long press the vol down and it mutes the mic at the headset regardless of the app or phone connection being used at the time.I love the battery life. These headphones will make it through an entire day with plenty of battery life left.  I've left them on overnight and they were still working in the morning, and if I do get in a low battery situation they will work just fine while charging so I can plug them in and let them charge while I'm using them.Overall I am very pleased with the Jabra Evolve 65.  My wife has the Evolve 75 with active NC on the headphones and I've tried them out and didn't feel they were worth the additional money for my use, but it does work really well so if you are in a call center type environment you might consider spending the extra money for the headphone NC.  otherwise, these Evolve 65's are a fantastic headset and I definitely recommend them.
Read the directions you have to hold the Bluetooth button for 3 seconds to connect. I only say this because so many reviews say they can not connect.. my only complaint is they are a bit loose on my head and fall off if I bend over to pick something up.
The sound quality, light weight and noise cancellation and can wear for longer period are good part of headphone and I liked all these features. One thing I didn‚Äôt like is not easy to connect charging cable to headphone and charging cable pin pin does not go easily , otherwise everything is good

I ordered this on the recommendation of a TikTok creator, and for the money it is perfect. They are comfortable to wear while sleeping. (I listen to meditations while falling asleep. The stay in place while I am sleeping and I am very pleased.
Superb quality. Remarkably exceptional delivery. Ever so marvellous packaging. Wish all sellers were this first-rate. A+!
I love these headphones
Hands down the best sound and user friendly connections for the money.
Look cheap, feel super cheap, sound cheap. They are severely lacking bass. Tbh put your money towards some sennheisers or Sony headphones for just another 40 bucks or so you will get infinitely better quality and feel. The color is cute though and they are light cause they are cheap. Hope this helps.
The headset is cool sounds good nois cancellation is awesome
Don't get me wrong, these are good headphones. But mine are busted to the point I'm afraid of wearing them. I'm as careful as I can be, seeing as this was the first pair of Bluetooth headphones I've ever had. And I've had these for a little more than a year. And no, the warranty doesn't cover this, which means I would have to buy a new pair when these were already almost $70. My old $40 wired Skullcandy headphones apparently are of better quality than this, and I can't use the wires since I have to move around a lot when cleaning.The sound is good, the random disconnection is annoying. These are good headphones, but comparing the quality to price, it's not worth it.The same breaking happened with my mom too, who bought these headphones for me. Her headphones started cracking around the same time mine did, which was about three or four months ago, and she doesn't even wear hers everyday like I do. The breaking at the joint like part is even worse on the other side. I had to use duct tape just to keep the metal part in it's socket. And the breaking on the part that connects to the speaker happened maybe two days ago.Skullcandy is a good brand, but I am not fishing out another $70 to get headphones that'll break in a few months. And I'm already looking at different Bluetooth headphones since this is probably the last time I'm buying from Skullcandy.
Got these as a gift for Dad who loves music and he really enjoys them. Wireless freedom and trusted Skullcandy quality. Good price.
Idk why I expected extremely loud bass and sound from these headphones (even though I watched a bunch of reviews before buying). I was a bit disappointed in the sound as I wanted to hear (I don't speak music) the words louder and all... Noise cancellation is good. Of course, you know the person beside me can hear what I'm listening to.I love the colour...love love love it. The fit is good too...I don't mind (and I do have a fairly big head and thick hair)There's an exposed wire at the ear muff where you can fold it, I know it should have been hidden inside because there's a crease for that. (I hope I explained that right)Anyways...it's still a good buy
The Bluetooth randomly disconnects and won't reconnect until some random unknown event let's it connect again

Just received them. In my opinion, they are excellent cans for the price! Tried them with my phone and my audio system with amp. Nice cans. I'm not sure why some people complain about bass. Plenty of natural bass. It depends on your source, of course. But even with my VERY old Samsung phone they are excellent! Do not compare these cans with $400 + ones! Again, for the price they exceeded my expectation.  Will update after a week or so.
Love em great sound I will buy more of these.
Awesome and clear sound quality Very happy with this purchase.  Noise reduction also great.
Por el precio brinda un sonido excelente!
These headphones were for guitar practice. I haven't even used them for that and I'm already ready to return them. they are very uncomfortable. The cups really are so small. I have a small head and they were so tight. I paired them with my MacBook, sat in them and I'm sorry these are just too uncomfortable. The sound is also not that big of a deal. I need them for my amp so I had no intensions of using it for anything else. I've heard better. And because these aren't very multi task for me and they aren't very comfortable I'm going to return them. 50 dollars is still a lot of money to pay for something from this brand. Hopefully my other headphones will do the job.
They are nice but the opening for the ear seems a bit narrow. Ear fits in but too snug which I am waiting to see if it irritates them cause it's the reason I was looking for over ear, to not irritate them. Will update if they do.
These headphones are really good. The sound quality is superb, the design is sturdy and light, and is comfortable to wear for hours at a time. I have had no issues with using the Sennheiser HD 400S.
I'm not a power audio studio user. However, these guys have impressed me on my guitar practice sessions. Wire extension is short so might be uncomfortable in some occasions
The overall quality is simply one of the best around the price. But the volume is a bit low (or smaller) than other headphones, which isn't a big problem when you simply raise the volume.
They‚Äôve held up with a teenager using them daily for 3 months. Says they are working as expected and isn‚Äôt left wanting more.

Basically, out of the box I loved almost everything about the BT-600 ANC... except sound, ironically.These are my personal "rankings":-PACKAGE-  8/10The headphones come in a pretty hard shell case, which while bulky is a great plus since many other cans in this price range don't come with anything more than a mesh pouch or something similar.Included are a 1.0 m long slim detachable audio cable and a very short USB-A to USB-C (thank god) charging cable.You can easily replace both.The little manual will guide you through first use.-BATTERY- 9.5/10These things will last LONG, with mixed usage you will easily go through an entire week without needing to charge them, and much more with light usage.You don't get fast charging... but eh, it's a really minor thing considering the battery life.-DESIGN- 8/10They're somewhat anonymous, with minimal branding and a clean look (which I actually like a lot and one of the reasons for such a low price).But if you just want to "look super cool", these probably aren't for you.They don't have water resistance... but come on, who would expect that from these?-USAGE- 8.5/10The cans can be used wired-only (so battery off), wired but with ANC and volume control, or wirelessly with all functions enabled. Speaking of which, there are 3 buttons and a touch surface on the right earcup, the buttons are for power, ANC switch, Bluetooth pairing. With the touch surface you can control volume, play/pause, go through songs, answer calls... etc. More details in the manual.It takes some time to get used to... but it's nice overall.A lady voice will announce most actions, a bit annoying but it's fine.BE WARY that these don't have a dedicated companion app for customization and tuning, however.You'll need system audio settings or else third-party applications.-COMFORT and DURABILITY- 8/10 ; 7/10Considering their bulk, they're good. The memory cups are soft and comfortable, not super great but definitely won't destroy your ears. You may feel a bit of pressure on your head because the top padding isn't completely spread out, but it's pretty normal. Clamping force is alright, you'll barely notice a difference if you wear glasses.If these are uncomfortable for you then most over-ear headphones will be too anyway.Of course portability is not the best, but they're foldable so you can carry them with the case.They're plasticky, which is to be expected. It's decently sturdy, however.Just don't expect them to endure too many years of abuse and... don't sit on them.-ANC- 8.5/10ANC performance is surprisingly great for the price range. Of course we're not talking Airpods Max level, but those are like 7x the price, have no real case or high-quality codecs and barely work outside iOS... yikes.ANC covers low and mid-pitched sound while the passive cup isolation does the job with high frequencies.A tiny con is that using noise canceling introduces a slight hiss (expecially in the left ear). It's similar to white noise though so it's not really annoying or anything. It's normal with most ANC cans.You also have AMBIENT MODE which does the opposite effect and lets more sound pass so you can be a bit more aware.Then there is just passive which disables ANC and ambient mode.Whenever you put your hand over the right ear-cup, AMBIENT MODE will be temporarily activated and the volume lowered to a minimum so you can have a conversation if needed.For the record, you can use ANC and ambient mode even with the audio cable in, the cans automatically disable Bluetooth and some of the touch controls to save battery life.-BLUETOOTH- 8/10The range is above average, nothing groundbreaking. The BT-600ANC support Bloetooth 5 and a great number of high quality codecs (although it won't make too much of a difference, it's nice to see broad support in cheap cans). They can technically connect to two devices, but can only play audio from one at a time. Still useful if you want to quickly switch between phone and laptop, for example.-AUDIO- 6.5/10Now... the not so great part.If you're any kind of audiophile and/or young age, you may HATE the default sound profile.The bass is decent, but the sub bass is low, some of the mids are a bit too uneven, however the main issue is the highs (like, 13-20 kHz range) are very lacking.It's sort of consumer-friendly and won't fatigue your ears, true, and it's probably fine for people who only generically listen to typical music these days, yes.But for many other pieces, sound is very muffled and clarity is pretty disappointing.To make things even weirder, they actually sound somewhat different depending on if you use them wired, wired+battery, or wirelessly.Luckily with a lot of E.Q. fiddling I found good compromise presets and I can now fully enjoy these cans. Sound quality is not even bad, it's actually on par with the price range, it's mostly the default frequency response that's underwhelming and it's the only TRUE weakness of these cans. This is the only reason I can't recommend these to EVERYONE.The microphone is pretty serviceable, as a plus.-FINAL THOUGHTS-A pair of bang-for-the-buck minimalistic cans with premium features usually found in much pricier headphones, an outstanding battery life, adequate durability and portability, with the only glaring weakness being an underwhelming but forgivable default sound profile.
I need a pair of headphones with good ANC to block out the excessive traffic noise problem where I live, but I can't afford the ones from Bose or Sony, so I had hoped these would be a good alternative.  The good news is that the ANC works well enough that I can barely hear the law-breaking bikers and hot-rodders who use the public streets as their own personal race track.  The bad news is that the earpads are way too small.  Like toddler sized small.  For someone with adult sized ears, they just don't work.  After about 15 minutes, they become uncomfortable.  After 30 minutes they become painful.  And after an hour, it feels like someone has taken a razor blade and sliced up both my ears.  Still, compared to the mental anguish of listening to the 5th biker in the last 60 seconds who feels the need to rev their engine to 8000 RPMs as they go screaming by my house, maybe the physical pain is preferable.The bottom line is this: if Monoprice had made the earpads replaceable and made large ones available (even if they were an additional cost), I would probably give these headphones 5 stars.  But they didn't, so I'm giving them 2 stars instead.  I just can't rate a product that causes intense physical pain better than that, no matter how good their ANC is.UPDATE - November 14, 2022I'm bumping my rating to 4 stars because I've found a way to make these headphones work much better for me.  I discovered it's possible to stretch the earcups by wedging in a pair of multivitamin bottle caps for a couple days.  The end result is headphones that now seem to fit my ears, and I haven't had to re-apply the stretching for two weeks now.  At last I have a pair of headphones that I can wear for hours at a time that block the unwanted traffic noises and are helping me to find a path back to mental sanity.
For the price I was hoping for a bit better. I looked up a lot of reviews and these were highly rated, but I don't find them much better than some cheaper brands I've worn before. I don't enjoy the gesture volume and track adjustment which I found to be really finicky, and the ear cuffs aren't very comfortable.I wear glasses, and I saw some reviews saying these were comfortable to wear all day. That is NOT the case with me. Maybe it's because of the type of glasses I wear, but I can wear different brands of over the ear headphones for hours with minimal discomfort. These give me the headache from hell after wearing them for an hour, and honestly they hurt even when I don't have the glasses on. Maybe I have a jacked up head shape or something.
Going to start by disagreeing with tango's 1-star review which stated that the "touchpad is triggered by EVERYTHING brushing against it, however lightly." I did not find this to be the case at all. In fact, the fact that the commands are not as simple as a 'light swipe' is the only reason I am not giving the headphones 5 stars. My only criticism is that actually takes a bit more force than I expect sometimes to get the touchpad to sense my commands. It's more awkward than a button because you are sliding your finger across a soft leathery feeling surface...just a bit to get accustomed to if you are used to headphones with button commands. Because of this evidence, I would like to dispute tango's review and say that my headphones have yet to be involuntarily triggered.I like the headphones having 3 noise cancelation modes: noise-canceling, ambiance (hearing everything around you with the built-in microphones), and regular (noise-canceling and ambiance off, so it's like normal headphones). I also love that there is a mute mode by covering the touchpad. This is perfect for replying to someone's question before returning to studying, for example.I also like the fit. I previously had the Beats Studio 3 headphones and after wearing them all day my ears hurt. In these headphones, the ear cup sits over my whole ear, without even touching it on the inside. A lot more comfortable!The ANC noise cancellation is decent, without being over the top. I think that it is better than the Beats Studio 3 noise cancellation. You don't get as much of the "fan sound" as in the Beats ones which is a huge plus.In comparison to my old headphones, these are way better: about a fifth of the price, better sound, better comfort, better construction (don't look like they'll break as easily as the Beats did). Great value.
I've had two major problems with these Monoprice headphonesThe first was a break in the left ear. I used these headphones almost every day for work, but I haven't ever had any trouble with my old Sony MDR-V6 pair that I used before this.After securing an RMA for the original pair, I was told that I would have to wait for Monoprice to get the headphones back in stock. The initial estimate was for August of 2022, although Amazon still had the set in stock. I used my old pair of headphones for work until they arrived in late September. After a bit I realized that there were several related issues with the replacement pair. I discovered these issues while connected to my 2019 Macbook that I have for work.1. The audio would occasionally cut in and out2. The headphones would disconnect from the Mac's bluetooth3. The headphones would power off on their accord, rare but very troublesomeAfter contacting Monoprice they said that my headphones were out of warranty and that we could not troubleshoot or swap out the replacement headhphones.Timeline:07/12/2021  Initial purchase of Monoprice headphones via Amazon05/27/2022  Headphones broke while still under warranty, replacement requested09/22/2022  Finally received replacement headphones10/19/2022  Sent message about 3 disconnecting issuesMy points of contention are this:1. Had I received the headphones in a timely manner, I would have still been under warranty, instead of waiting 4 months2. I was sent a defective product as a replacement. I would think they would be replaced regardless of warranty statusI unfortunately cannot recommend Monoprice headphones again to friends and family. The price was nice, but the quality and support is lacking.
+ Very good build quality and material+ Sound quality is very good I prefer it with noise canceling off+ Microphone quality is excellent for calls+ Very comfortable on the ears, I even had 30 mins run with them and they were stable+ Bluetooth connection range is fantastic+ Battery life is very good and charges very quickly with USB-C (if you have a fast charger)- Not for hot days run, the sweat just builds up and the material isn't built for sports- I wish it remembered my setting as I have to turn off ANC and Ambient every time I use the headphones- Turning off ANC and Ambient you have to wait for the voice confirmation that it is off, wish it was a switch or quick on/off- Doesn't turn off automatically when not used (Bluetooth has to be disconnected for it to power off automatically after 5 minutes)
So I decided to get these on a whim after minimal research on them. The sale was nice. These are my second pair of noise canceling headphones, and these are way better than the Sony NC headphones I had in high school. The touch controls are intuitive, they're very comfortable, and the combination of noise canceling and active sound is really great.Personally I didn't realize how noisy my space was until I used these. A great deal for the sale price, and I believe that even at full price, these are worth it. The quality is not like high impedeance headphones with a dedicated amp. The sound quality is still decent.[Update]These headphones were really nice while they lasted, but sadly mine broke less than a year after purchasing. There seems to be a weakness where the Y joint of the band is. Maybe I'm just a bit too rough with my gear. I did coddle these though, but a 2ft drop onto carpet did them in. If you are going to treat these very gingerly, than they're good for you. If not, maybe look into other options.
really nice headphones for the price range, the band is a little small though
Priced right. Work well.
Quality isn't that great. It's extremely hard to use the touchpad to control the media. Also, the volume range isn't that great (especially the lowest possible sound level, which I'm concerned with).
https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Evolve-Professional-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B00OD753U8/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews
I bought these for my workplace, since they only hand out Jabra Evolve 40s. The 40s are pretty lackluster, it is difficult to hear the call sometimes, and noise bleeds in since there is very little sound isolation.These Jabra Evolve 80s are a godsend for my farm of agents on the phone or just chatting noisily. They don't look super stylish, and it'll need some adjusting so the headset sits proper on your head without having the mic half an inch from your mouth, but their performance cannot be understated. I can hear 95% of all my calls with the Automatic Noise Cancellation off, and whenever the calls feels too quiet, or if I need extra concentration, I can swith the ANC on, and almost instantly the sound quality and volume gets boosted, and the noise of my co-workers goes neat silent.With ANC on, you do somewhat hear yourself talking. It's a bit hard to explain, but the closest explanation is that you're hearing what the mic is picking up being passed through a filter. So some background noise, like a very loud talker, will break through the noise isolation and be a bit distracting, but the volume/audio quality boost is invaluable.These headphones also sound amazing for music. Just the passive noise isolation is superb. Then I can flip the switch for ANC, and bam, more fidelity.The ANC is battery powered, and the headphones charge through the aux cord when plugged into the little USB hub! Pretty amazing.Overall, these are worth buying used. Mine were like new, and were a steal at $100. Full price, you'll feel a bit irked by plain silicone sheathing for the wire, and how the earpads rub against each other when taken off (at least at the tallest setting, I have a big head). They're not amazingly comfortable, and I always take them off after a call because you'll miss interactions from your supervisor or coworker (they show you're deep into your work) and ear sweat/grime is a potential hygiene issue (like with all over the ear headphones).Will very much boost your effectiveness if you're upgrading from the Jabra Evolve 40, people won't bother you with them on, and music sounds twice better. Very solid choice for a noisy workplace.
i work on my pc, at home, and needed a wired headset. these headphones far surpass my "on-ear" type, logitech h390s. i can hear better as well on my side, as can the folks on the other end. the noise cancellation is excellent. most ambient noise is actually eliminated while wearing the headset.the  ear comfort on this set are awesome, but i feel i have traded that for top-of-head discomfort. they are well padded on the band, but i guess i'm more sensitive to pressure on the top of my head. this discomfort is still better tolerated than ear discomfort felt with the on-ear ear style. if the band was a bit longer, i'd probably give them 5 stars instead of 4. i'm going to add some padded to the band, but i'm not sure it'll help the issue.i have tried a gaming headset, but they did not work well for phone conversations.the only thing odd i've discovered is that the volume is turned up pretty high on them to properly hear the other party. i really don't care how high the "number" is on the volume as long as i can adjust it to where it needs to be, i just notice it as interesting.bottom line is that the jabra evolve 80s are the best headset i've tried! PROS are awesome sound quality along with excellent noise cancellation and that fact i can wear them all day without as much discomfort as the one-ear style.  CON is the top of head discomfort (guess i just have a sensitive noggin)
These are good for Teams meetings only.  They make your ears hot after just a short period wearing them and music sounds horrible on them.  So buy these for meetings and buy Bose headphones for music and movies.
These are the solution for anyone whom has heavy call volume. It enables me to focus on the call , because the ANC eliminates all background noise. I got these as I work in a noisy warehouse, and the only thing my callers hear is my whispering voice. I have never had a customer mention any background noise, and another benefit is that due to the call quality it enables me to have private conversation and eliminates people walking by from listening in on calls. Since it sits over my ears it does not push my ears down thereby hurting my ears. I am able to charge it by turning the red bust light on. The passive noise cancellation is very effective when the headset is reganrging the ANC.This is my second pair. I no longer zip my headset up in the case because it I think that is what damaged the cord to the headset on my 1st set.Highly recommended
I own several pairs of high end headphones - Sennheiser, Entymotic research, Bose, Grado, etc.  These were the first hedphones I bought specifically for their Lync integration - which works great.  The audio quality is as good as my ears can hear and favorably compares to the other brands I mentioned.  The noise cancellation is fantastic - in an office environment, these outperform my Bose noise cancelling headphones.  It's not unusual for me to not notice someone trying to get my attention verbally - if you have low volume music playing, you won' hear much of what goes on in the open office. They are also very versitile - phone calls, music, gaming, etc.In my opinion, Jabra hit it out of the park with these.Compared to the Bose QuietComfort 25 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones for Apple Devices, Black, these are more comfortable (but bigger) and don't make you fuss with replacing AAA batteries (and because they charge plugged into your PC, probably won't ever be dead - but if you plan on using them on airplanes and such, the AAA battery may be more attractive).  The Bose headphones has the microphone in the cord, which is bad for audio quality.  The noise cancellation on the Jabra seems to work better in office environments.  The one thing I like better about the Bose headphones is the detachable cord - I've yanked on that cord way too many times, but it just pops right back into the headphones.Overall Likes:- Noise Reduction is fantastic- Comfortable - I can easily wear these all day in the office- Lync integration - the red LED rings on the headphones to tell people I'm in a meeting is a good touch for a work-oriented set of headphones- Microphone works great, no negative complaints of audio and I'm not worried about using them on customer calls- Charges when plugged into computer- Signalling Lync to transfer the call when unplugging from base is neat- Will work fine with a mobile phone (just won't charge when plugged in)- You can hear yourself when on calls - useful because hearing your key clicks will remind you that everyone else can hear them too.- Work great for gaming too- Mute button on right ear cup is good when someone is trying to talk to you - it disables all audio and turns the NR off temporarilyDislikes:- They are fairly big (as are all active noise cancelling headphones)- For this price, the cord should be replacable- I can't really see myself walking around using these with my cell phone- Would like mute button to pause iTunes
This is a great headset but didn't appear to have gotten much support online. Now they're on frizz and these were quite expensive. I'm hearing impaired and need these for work. I'm not sure what I'm going to do as I expected these to last at least 3 years and they barely made it to though year 2. Not impressed.
These do exactly what they say they will, but was taken aback when I realized that I had overlooked that they were hardwired. Most headphones in this price range are not. I  will keep them, but am not expecting these to last.
I bought this headset because it‚Äôs the recommended brand for my job. And it says it works on an iPhone and just requires an adapter. I have an apple verified adapter that I plugged the headset into to test call function and NO AUDIO. The test calls were a fail. I Can still hear the call through my iPhone speaker. This headset is basically an almost $300 paperweight and I don‚Äôt even have time to refund and purchase a new one because I need it for tomorrow. Works great for listening to my music app but I have AirPods for that. I needed this for work. And it‚Äôs USELESS for that purpose. Do NOT buy this if you‚Äôre needing to use a cellphone with this headset. I have the 12 Pro Max. There‚Äôs zero reason this headset shouldn‚Äôt work. I was sold a faulty pair.
When it works, it‚Äôs great. I bought a used/refurbished pair for VOIP calls at work and listen to music between calls. It‚Äôs very effective blocking out noise and the sound quality is good (not great) for music. The ANC has a hint of white noise. It‚Äôs not the dark velvety smooth silence you would get with Bose, but effective nonetheless.My first pair wouldn‚Äôt hold a charge, so I returned them and Amazon promptly whisked out a replacement. I‚Äôve read enough reviews to understand these are simply not durable, so I simply refuse to pay full retail.The Jabra Evolve 80 is like my first pet, a beautiful Bernese Mountain Dog with an amazing disposition. He died of cancer age 7. I knew what I was getting into, the breed just doesn‚Äôt live long. But it was great while it lasted. Just don‚Äôt pay full price üòâ
I bought these for my customer service job. 10 months later, the headband snapped in 2 places. Also, will not charge unless it's plugged into a USB 3.0 port. USB 2.0 doesn't have enough power to support this unit. Luckily I bought a protection plan. For what I paid, I would have expected a better quality design.**Update**, This unit comes with a 2-year warranty. I called Jabra and they replaced mine with a new set within about 10 days.

This is my second pair.  First lasted 6 years.  Good quality sound.
I'm satisfied with these headphones, though I did find them much cheaper from Walmart, and Cowin.
I bought these to replace an identical pair that broke after quite a few years of use.Where the new headphones did connect and worked fine with the Pixel 6 and Chromebook, the sound quality on the TV was very poor. It was like trying to hear underwater.I reached out to the manufacturer for technical support. They did help and was working on a warranty resolution. After reviewing the receipt, they would not assist further because I purchased from Amazon.I reached out to Amazon and they declined to assist with the problem because the purchase had just passed the 30-day window to return them.The situation is quite a disappointment.
The sound quality is fantastic. Great battery life and noise canceling.
I absolutely adore these!!! I've had a pair of these for a few years & they were perfect. Finally started to show wear so I replaced  with a new one. Didn't bother to shop around whatsoever. Nice work Cowin!!! I would 100% recommend to anyone:)
They are good at noise cancelling (l live on a busy street and use them to bluetooth to my smart tv) and they are great quality.
These are reliable and sturdy.  Great buy.
I did buy E7 for half the price a few years ago. It‚Äôs a really great product. I still have it though left ear is broken mechanically. And I need to push it back every time I put them on. So I decided to move up the ladder and try E8 at higher price. Feel cheated after receiving the exact same E7 model for twice the price.
I have been trying to contact your customer service department since beginning of August and have yet to receive an email or have my phone call returned despite leaving voicemails and sending multiple emails. I purchased these headphones 2 years ago and they have completely fallen apart to the point where I can no longer use them. This has severely hindered me as a college student. The headphones were always stored and handled properly. Product just seems cheaply made, yet cost $150 USD. The about info leads you to believe they are a USA company, but they are actually Chinese! TERRIBLE QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
The product was built flimsy

Sounds good
Headphones came packaged really good. They are great, sound is great and connects easily to smart tv and phone but after a while it is no longer comfortable on ear. Pressure on ear starts to hurt. This is the only complaint so far on headset. At first they felt comfy but found a long period of an hr is all it took to start feeling it tight on ears and a bit painful but battery lasted good.
My expectations weren‚Äôt exactly met; however the T450BT are a decent set of earphones. I had, prior to these, T510. Which I liked very much not they broke (brittle plastic) but the sound quality of the T450 as the stereo sound is as good. My only complaint is the battery life it is half of the T510
Excellent quality
my only complaint is wind noise, pretty comfortable, and a god send when someone is playing music or talking nonstop on the phone next to you, great for commuting, better than ear buds which never fit me right and sound like S$%^.  fits in my travel bag. the jury's still out on the durability
Sounds great with good bass. Set up was easy and quick. The only thing I might miss is no jack input if I wanted to bypass the blue tooth. Solid value.
I use these with Bluetooth to my iphone when I mow my lawn. It takes about 4 hours to mow and these stay charged the whole time. Would recommend.
Listen music
Good product
I didn't like how they fit. They're too hard. The plug doesn't stay in my phone. I have to keep connecting it to the Bluetooth. Just wasn't a good product. I am returning it.

Perfect for a house keeper. Fits great don‚Äôt have to worry about them slipping or sliding off. Noise cancellation is great against a vacuum.  Really nice quality.
I‚Äôve bought ear pods and other headphone for my son. These are 100% approved. I finally found good quality. Long lasting battery life, sleek style ‚Äúcute‚Äù as I say it. Very noise canceling‚Ä¶when they want to tune you out. Highly recommend.
I took as a gift so I'm not sure how the quality is, but when I checked it I was awesome.
Comfortable to wear and pleasurable to listen to music through. A good buy in headphones. As the environment gets noisier and my hearing gets more acute and sensitive, I crave silence . As someone who can hear dolphins surfacing across the harbor, blocking PA system, alarms, trucks backing and fire-engines across the city, becomes impossible. These headphones do give me some respite.
Well a few months in my when i use bluetooth the headphones wont let me lower the volume like it doesn't go down even if it says it does also they are good headphones it just happened out of no where.
It will block out any unwanted sounds with the noise cancellation. I enjoy using bopmen s40 when I watch a movie or I just want to listen to music by myself.
I haven't really used it yet, but it is comfortable and does reduce the noise. I bought it to wear at an event that was supposed to be very loud. It wasn't that loud so I wound up not wearing them.
Not a bad pair of wireless headphones for the price. I didn‚Äôt do much searching I admit but I went off the reviews and the ratings and took a shot‚Ä¶Pleasantly surprised. Got them today and they paired easily with my iPhone SE. Decent rich sound although I could use a tad bit higher volume. For the price paid they‚Äôre decent and handle the job with ease. I have yet to see how they fair in the long run but they‚Äôve impressed me so far.
Great headset that works really well. The noise cancelling is great. It works on Bluetooth, but can also be connected with a wire and audio jack (included in package), which is really convenient in f.ex. a plane.Only 1 downside is that it doesn‚Äôt power off automatically, so if you forget to turn it off, the battery runs dead.
Got a pair for each of my two older boys. They are a great product and are at an even better price point!!

I went from the XM3 to the upgraded XM5 and I‚Äôm very happy with the new look and fit of the XM5. A bit more sleek and the sound quality is a bit better. My favorite part is the user friendly interface, the headphones respond better when using the right cup to control the volume and pausing or playing content. Very happy with the XM5.
Best headphones ever!
The noise cancelation and sound quality are like no other. The touch controls are kind of tricky at first but easy enough after some practice.
https://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-BT-500ANC-Bluetooth-Headphones-Cancelling/product-reviews/B08VRKXPXJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews
First, these are over-the-ear headphones. The photos make them look like on-ear headphones to me.They have active noise cancelling, activated with a switch. It works well enough and filters out mostly low rumbling noises. You can still hear talking and higher frequency noises pretty well through it (that may be on purpose). When it's on, there's a noticeable hiss that's typical of some noise canceling devices. You can tell it's there when nothing is playing but when the sound is on it disappears.The sound quality is disappointing though. The audio over bluetooth sounded far away and seemed to be missing the high and low ranges. I didn't try it directly connected to a cable. I assume there was a problem with the set that I got, or an incompatibility with my phone or computer.They are a bit heavy for my preference.However, overall they are very comfortable to wear, and fit me nicely.I also have the BT-300ANC, and I think those are a better choice from monoprice though, and for $30 less. The noise canceling on the 300s isn't quite as good, but it doesn't hiss. The 300s are also lighter and have much better sound quality over bluetooth, at least on my devices.
The Monoprice BT-500ANC Bluetooth headphones are very high-quality in terms of sound quality, timber, high, midrange and low notes, and ear comfort. The device pairs easily with a smartTV, i.e., a Samsung T7000 Series. It charges fairly quickly via USB, and are adjustable over the ear. The headphone is nicely padded as well. The only very minor nitpick would be better labeling on the Volume buttons, since they match the heaphone color, so not too visible in very dim lighting. Overall, I highly recommend the Monoprice BT-500ANC Bluetooth Headphones.
This is my first device with noise reduction so I have nothing to compare against.  It eliminates my central furnace fan noise wonderfully.  But when the furnace turns off, I'm left with a residual annoying noise from the cancellation, which I need to turn off.
Worked okay but not comfortable to wear.
Definately not worth the over 100 dollars I spent! The audio on these is TERRIBLE. Honestly. I bought a pair of vankyo c750 and when played side by side the vankyo c750 have AMAZING BASS, RICHER SOUND, and the vankyo c750 are only HALF THE PRICE of these ones!!!!! So do yourselves a favor save your 110 bucks, don't buy these ones, and grab a pair of vankyo at half that price :)

La calidad de sonido es buena para editar audio o video, si no eres un profesional de alto nivel pero para personas que crean cosas m√°s por trabajos sencillos o por gusto est√°n m√°s que perfecto. (Y aun mas si t√∫ o√≠do no est√° entrenado) si los quieres para escuchar m√∫sica regular mente, recomiendo los Beats Studio 3 ahora est√°n en ofertas y tiene cancelaci√≥n de ruido cosa que los estos no tienen.
I love these and I have 2 of them, one wired and the other wireless.
I've owned nearly a dozen high quality over-ear headphones since my first pair of Koss cans in 1969. While I've always preferred neutral and accurate sound representation, a gradual decline in hearing acuity led me to shop for slightly brighter -- yet still high quality -- sound reproduction, which the Crossfade 2 offer. What a profound listening delight over 14 months of use and abuse these have been! These are very well-designed and durable headphones that have stood up to my occasional carelessness (dropping, spills, sweat etc.). A surprise has been the astounding quality of the bluetooth signal/sound reproduction, especially for the music of my choice: most modern jazz. It took awhile for me to get used to the fit, but they've been remarkably comfortable and stable while always maintaining a gently firm hold... even while I've worked out on a cross-trainer. I've decided to use these primarily as workout cans at this point with the intent of purchasing a pair of the M-200 model. Highly recommended.I wrote the ABOVE review shortly after purchasing the Crossfade II. I never did purchase a pair of M-200. I'm changing my review to 1 STAR. Today -- Feb 17, 2021 -- I gave up on V-Moda. Here's my account: At some point in mid-2019, while taking my V-Moda headphones off -- one of the the arrow-shaped plastic tips at the base of my head band - cracked and broke loose. After examination, I decided to use superglue, which held. While applying clue, I noticed the plastic tip was connected to the metal strap headband by plastic knobs. Not good, but since the glue held, I kept using the headphones. THEN, last December (2020) the plastic tip broke again, this time for good. Here's where the disappointment in V-Moda headphones set in. Thinking I could contact V-Moda for repair or another tip, I used my account password and  asked for repair service. Return answer: V-Moda does NOT repair headphones out of warranty. Not even if I was willing to pay for repair (which I was). I was informed, however, that I could use my IMMORTAL LIFE warranty and trade-in my Crossfade 2 wireless ... for a 20% discount on a new pair of my choice. After considering my options, I declined to do so. My reasoning? V-Moda headphone bands may look sturdy, but held together by plastic end pieces significantly reduce the life of the headphones. To date, I have successfully used Scotch Super 33+ Electrical tape in order to continue using the headphones, because the speakers still work perfectly. But I realize this is not a good long-term solution. I am now shopping for comparable headphones that are warranted by a seller that also offers lifetime repair service. In my opinion, $300 audiophile headphones should last longer than three years.
I love how well made these headphones are.My only complaint is battery life is only 14 hours, come on guys, sometimes I work 18hr days.
I bought a used pair of these on Amazon at a nice discount. Came in the mail, charged them overnight. Woke up and... they don't turn on. Tried to troubleshoot online and pretty much no one else has this problem except for a couple people after 2 years of ownership. Figured it was just a bad pair and I got unlucky.Just ordered a brand new pair on Amazon. Came in today and... they don't turn on. I let them charge for two hours and still nothing. No white light, no ability to pair, the volume buttons don't even do anything. I let them charge overnight and still, no power. The pair works when plugged into an aux cable, but it just plays the audio without any control from buttons at all. The only indication that there's any life in these headphones is the pulsing orange light when it is plugged into a charger. But as soon as the charger is not plugged in, nothing happens at all.I love the design, sound quality, everything about these headphones, but I'm exhausted by this process. Pretty sure if this doesn't get resolved and I need to send back a second pair, I'll be staying far away from V-MODA.

The headset is very very comfortable and sounds great. Headset was so comfortable that a little spider decided it wanted to make it his little home inside the ear peice. Thats how comfty it was.
I am all over the place regarding my thoughts on the PLY Headset. I certainly like the playful, youthful design. I appreciate the subtle multi-color scheme on the sides. It does not go full neon -except for the stiff, bubblegum-looking blue USB and pink 3.5mm cable, which thankfully can be replaced by whichever one you‚Äôd prefer. They are well made, although I worry a bit about the cloudy see-through covers and headband (which is quite flexible). The earpads are made of this super soft cloth-covered memory foam and feel rather premium.They are quite light and comfortable. The suspension-style headband produces very little pressure on my head. I was able to wear them for 3-4 hours sessions with no discomfort, overheating, or soreness on my head and ears. The clamping force is light -almost too much, as sudden headshaking will cause the headset to fall off. So, if you get too physically excited during a game, these cans may not be for you.On paper, the PLYR is supposed to be a wireless multi-point audio solution between platforms. However, there are a few caveats to doing so. While one can always be paired to a Bluetooth device, one must use the USB or 3.5mm cable to have a simultaneous audio connection. This defeats the wireless experience unless you fork up $20 to get a dongle, which is strangely not available at the moment. In reality, these are primarily wired headsets with Bluetooth 5.2 capability. Also, I did experience more than a few hiccups, disconnects, pauses, and sync issues. Having said all this, I actually enjoyed listening to a podcast on my phone or answering calls without pausing the game on my PC.The sound is good out of the box. Depending on certain content, the bass has some impact and even some of that sub-woofer feeling. However. it can get a bit bloaty at higher volumes. The mids and treble are where these cans mostly shine. They bring a good amount of clarity without being harsh or sibilant. There is decent channel separation, and the soundstage is sparse. This makes playing FPS games especially enjoyable.The removable microphone is average. The boom mic is very stiff, and I couldn‚Äôt get it closer to my mouth which is why I think it is on the quiet side -even at 100% input. Some people definitely noticed it when playing.I am very impressed with the Skullcandy Gaming App. From volume, mic gain, game/chat, sidetone, and firmware updates, it is full of options, settings, and tweaks. You can choose a preset EQ, as well as customize it completely.  It‚Äôs quite easy to use and rather functional.In the end, the PLYR headset is a good entry for gamers that wish to be connected to their phones while playing. I do wish a wireless dongle would‚Äôve been included, as this would have made this a must-buy. If it wasn‚Äôt for the app and decent price point, this would‚Äôve been 3 stars at best.
Our house has become a headset house with all the gaming and work from home. Because of that we‚Äôve gotten a variety of headphones.Pros:- comfortable gel ear pads- comfortable elastic band over head- detachable microphone- good sound- easy to use exterior click and dial controlsCons:- heavy compared to others- not foldable for travel- usb Bluetooth transmitter costs extra (really?)- odd coloring- wish small bag included for accessories
I've only used wired headsets previously, but my current ones are starting to see some wear, and I wanted to give this headset a try.  I was incredibly pleased with the results.There is a tiny bit of assembly required as the elastic band that rests on your head comes as a separate piece.  It has two different sets of attachment holes to allow you to adjust for your preference, and they simple press into place.The headset is lightweight and holds itself in place without feeling like it's squeezing your head.  The ears are fabric, not leatherette, so it won't crack and flake over time.  The memory foam is also very comfortable and provides good sound dampening.It also has very simple controls.  The power switch is responsive, the volume setting adjusts quickly, and the side buttons on the earpiece are a great plus.  Pressing the top can play/pause music or a video or answer/decline a phone call.  The bottom button mutes/unmutes the microphone.The headset connects very easily.  Pushing the power button up sends it into pair mode, and every device I tried instantly recognized it and connected without any issue.  It comes with a USB cable for charging or plugging into a computer, and it immediately registers as an audio input/output device.  It also includes a 3.5 mm cable to connect to a gaming controller or any other device with a headphone jack.It recommends using the app or desktop client for tuning the audio, and it does make a difference.  It sounded pretty good out of the box, but I went through the hearing test that it does, and all the tones and sounds picked up to match my hearing perfectly.  It also only took a few minutes to complete, so I highly recommend going for that customization.My favorite feature is the additional microphones that remove the need for the boom mic.  I tried it with and without the boom, and people could hear me well and clearly both ways.  Going without the boom also surprised me by not picking up much background noise.It charges easily, and it holds the charge well, even through multiple hours of use.FINAL WORD: If you want a wireless headset, you want this one!
Design/Appearance:-----------------------These over-the-ear beauties are gorgeous. The overall design and color palates can't be beat. 1980s Vice City pinks and blues and even some clear colors... I'm wearing them right now without even playing music because they are so pretty and comfortable. Call me ridiculous if you want.Controls:----------The controls are perfect and easy - tap on the top for play/pause, tap on the bottom to mute/unmute the mic, and a physical analog dial for the volume... WHICH I LOVE. I absolutely love volume dials/knobs. And I hate it that they are becoming so rare.Sound:--------The sound quality is fantastic, although for this price point, they should have active noise canceling. It's too bad they don't. But long-pressing the top button does something... is that an attempt at noise canceling? It doesn't seem to change much.Gaming Use / Latency:---------------------------As I've said in other bluetooth, latency is always an issue. However‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt seem to find any here. Other reviewers have complained about it- please go check out the details. But I can‚Äôt personally find any delay or lag issue. SO much better than my earbuds, which I can‚Äôt even watch Netflix with.-Sidetone (the ability to hear yourself talk) can be turned on and off- awesome.-Modes - single-click the volume wheel. I have no idea what they do (FPS/RPG/Music/Default) and I can‚Äôt tell a difference. Gimmick?Misc.-------Very expensive. Worth it? Not for me. But it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that these are awesome.-Comes with audio cable and USBA-USBC cable, both excellent quality.-Like most bluetooth headphones, it can only connect to one device at a time. And it gets to decide which device gets priority. Annoying.-Lastly- The box‚Äôs promise that this device is ‚ÄúCompatible with‚Ä¶‚Äù and then naming every type of gaming console and computer and device is both ridiculous and condescending. It‚Äôs bluetooth. IT IS BLUETOOTH. There is no compatibility to question. Don‚Äôt insult us, Skullcandy.
The Skullcandy PLYR is very similar in design to SteelSeries Arctis headsets. It has a band to distribute the weight across your head, and I really like the thick ear cups which fit around the ear instead of compressing the ears against the head. The ear cups are also foam with a cloth cover instead of leather material so it breathes better and keeps your ear and head from getting sweaty after extended use. I also thought the audio quality was very good without having to tweak any equalizer settings. Bass was solid, and delicate high notes from Bach's Chaconne came out clear as well. As a bluetooth headset for listening to music, these work great.But if you're wanting them for serious gaming, you'll be disappointed. There is slight audio latency due to the bluetooth connection, so watching a video or playing a game means the audio won't sync with the visual image. This is a known issue with bluetooth, which is why gaming headsets usually come with a 2.4ghz USB transmitter for the wireless connection. Skullcandy is aware of the issue and suggests you purchase the wireless transmitter (sold separately) for an ultra low latency connection. Gamers spend good money on low latency and ultra fast response times for their wireless mice and keyboards, so not including the transmitter with this headset that's advertised for gaming seems like a big miss. You can used the wired connection to mitigate the latency, but then its a wired headset.As a plain bluetooth headset, this is 4 stars (somewhat pricey, no noise cancellation). For a gaming headset, 2 stars because it sounds good, but there are plenty of better options for low latency gaming.
I am a fan of Skullcandy gaming products for many years, so I was very happy that these performed totally up to my expectations.First the fit, extremely comfortable, the memory foam is super soft and large enough to comfortably cover my dumbo ears, one of the more comfortable headsets I have ever tried on. They are extremely easy to setup, I used Bluetooth and connected them flawlessly to my PC. I tested them out with music first, wow, sounded awesome, great clarity and bass and nice volume level. Now for the important part, gaming, I tested them with a quick game of COD (Call of Duty) and was very happy with the results, the spatial sound worked well, I was able to hone in on the enemies by their footsteps, worked great, and I read that it will even get better if I used their app, will have to try that next.Final thoughts:Skullcandy does it again, solid headset with extreme comfort and great sound... can't wait for my next gaming session.
Bought these for my husband to use with his XBox etc. after I got the SLYR Pro for myself and he kept borrowing them. He loves over-the-ear headsets and the elastic headband is more comfortable than the squishy cushion on the SLYR. The ear pieces are nice and large, instead of hard foam they‚Äôre a more squishy soft mesh material. He has some hearing loss and using the SkullCandy mobile app, he customized the output to his individual needs; he no longer needs to use the visual cues for hearing impaired on FortNite, for instance. He also likes muting the mic with the press of the ear piece vs switching the mic up and down. Make sure to read the guide to get the most out of them, 10/10 would buy again!
This is the first time I've used Skull Candy headset. So far we've used them for music via bluetooth and connected to the laptop. The sound is so good and they feel very comfortable on.
Got myself a pair to see how they were so far so good headphones are very comfortable and sound is pretty good with gaming an just normal audio compared to my logitech g733 headphones its even better with the skull candy software allowing to edit sound profiles haven't had any issue's with connectivity using wireless all an all for me great pair of headphones
https://www.amazon.com/Cleer-Enduro-ANC-Black/product-reviews/B08G3GP42M/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews
I picked up the Cleer Enduro ANC headphones to have backup over the ear headphones for my Sony WH-1000XM3 that I wear daily. I've tried not to make direct comparisons between these 2 in my review, but there is some comparisons to be made which I've tried highlight.Sound Quality - Out of the box these headphones represent the mid-range really well, but both high/low-range frequencies are somewhat flat. I listen to a lot of drum and bass, as well as some rock, hip-hop, and a spattering of other genres, and all of them sounded a little anemic when listening on these. After downloading and pairing with the Cleer+ app, I was able to change the equalizer settings from flat to something else which improved the listening experience significantly.Ambient Noise Control - The ambient noise control works pretty well, is controllable via the Cleer+ app, and can be configured so that only a small amount of ambient noise comes through when listening. Noise cancellation works well enough that you'd want to listen with one can off if you're waiting for a train or something, but not so good that I can ignore my neighbor's dog barking at the wind.Bluetooth Connectivity -  Bluetooth connects super fast, even when connecting to multiple paired devices. There seems to be some optimizations made here for windows devices, which switch the audio sink almost immediately after the headphones are connected. Connectivity range is superb, enabling to continue listening to music on the PC in my Office while preparing lunch ~25 feet away and through 3 walls.Comfort - My typical listening session is between 1 and 4 hours, and these are comfortable-ish to wear for that entire time. I've got  big ears, which don't fit "under" most over the ears, including these. That said the ear cushions are cozy enough to sit over my bottom lobes comfortably. I wish the headband cushion had about 1/4" more of padding, and that there was 0.5" to 1.0" more adjustment to be had in the headband, because they are on heavy end for headphones in this range making them uncomfortable for extended listening.Battery Life - With my listening patterns (1 - 4 hours, 1 - 3x per day), these headphones lasted 10+ days on a single charge, meaning I easily got 40+ hours of listening on a single charge. I also forgot to turn them off for 4 days with no listening before finding the power savings setting (oops), and they still had 20% battery remaining (enough for an entire workday of listening).Fit and Finish - These are pretty headphones, made with solid plastics and metal "where it matters" that add not only to the visual aesthetic, but also improves the durability of parts likely to fail if you pack these away after every use. I am not a fan of the included soft bag because I'm not a fan of just throwing headphones into a container with accessories that could scratch or possibly tear headphone surfaces. These are deserving of a zippered case that includes organization for charging cable and other accessories.  Included accessories are good, with gold "where it matters". I'd have preferred a longer usb-c to 2.5mm stereo cable which isn't quite long enough for me to use when working at my desk.App - The Cleer+ Android app is simple, but presents the controls most people care about most (Ambient Noise Control, Equalizer) once it has paired with the headphones. Additional settings (like power savings) can be found under the settings icon. In my use, so far, the App has "just worked", plus the the headphones preserved equalizer settings after unpairing the app, meaning I could get the better sound without having to keep the app running. In my opinion, the App, at least on Android, is deserving a far better rating, probably in the 4 - 4.5 range.Overall - These will be hard headphones to beat in the sub-$200 range, and you can expect them to compete with or even beat headphones in the $200 - $400 in terms of sound quality, bluetooth connectivity, and battery life. They could be a little more comfortable for all-day listening given their 60+ hour battery life, but outside the only other improvement I would like to see is a better case to store them in.
Really solid pair of headphones especially for the price. First up the audio is crazy cleer and i was suprised to find the bass was really good a punchy it will not disappoint if you like a lot of bass. They‚Äôre extremely comfortable go completely over the ear which was a  big worry for me because my ears are huuuge and elven ive worn them for hours straight no hotspots or anything so overall comfort is really nice. Now noise cancellation could be better but isnt bad for the price its best at canceling sounds like fans, faucets, and the distant sound of the  highway  almost completely. Battery life is crazy can easily last for a whole week or more on a single charge i also like the set up of how to work it its really simple and easy to get the hang of. My biggest complaint though would be that its not very loud this isnt a very big problem but i wish it was a little louder most headphones you only have to keep on around75-80% these are around 90% this shouldn't keep anyone from buying them and if its a really big problem for you can go to eq settings in the app and put all the slides up all the way it will make it WAY louder. I should also point out that they're also just a really good looking pair of headphones and feel really nice, and the app is also really easy to use. So overall i would say there probably one of the best headphones for the price range there are some things that would be nice to be added like a hard case and replacement ear cups you can buy and theyre probably not as good as like AirPods max or Sony xm4‚Äôs but are a stellar pair of headphones that are worth the money.
I have been eyeballing this for a almost a year debating on buying it bc I was really ify, every headset I have ever bought has either broken or had horrible sound.So let‚Äôs get this straight, I‚Äôm a PC gamer and one of the reasons I got this headset was bc Logitech came out with a very cute new headset, and it‚Äôs bluetooth but unfortunately I hate the look of huge bulky headsets, and where it‚Äôs probably very nice, I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to buy it lol. I wanted something I could use to game with and to take to the gym with me or to clean with or walk around with, and do art. I don‚Äôt think the the Logitech headset had those capabilities. And I didn‚Äôt want the mic part bc I have an external mic I paid good money for so it‚Äôs kinda a waste for my particular case. So I finally put money aside for this headset, and it‚Äôs so amazing. The reviews where the thing that really drew me in because they were all so positive and I actually couldn‚Äôt believe it but it sounded too good to not try it out. I end up loving them.LET ME JUST SAY, Opening the box and being able take it out was such an experience let me tell you. The company really takes their time with how they choose to present the product to you. I have no question in my mind why this baby is pricy, I almost thought about trying out the $200 one but I decided to try this one out first and eventually upgrade. It really was such a luxurious unboxing, who ever designed it knows what their doing and knows how to give someone such a special experience.Tiny con for people that want to damage their ears? If you need extremely loud headphones these aren‚Äôt for you. In my opinion they go pretty loud and actually keep mine down a few notches bc they are already sound proof and the music is crystal cleerrr, so there‚Äôs no bothersome background noise coming through your listening. Maybe if you were listening to an audiobook or podcast‚Ä¶ but music there won‚Äôt be any trouble there. I have a toddler who screams and laughs loudly, and sometimes (when he fights itüòÇ) before I put him down for a nap I‚Äôll actually have to pause my music and take my headphones off to listen to make sure he‚Äôs asleep or awake because you can‚Äôt hear anything with these on.Gaming with these on is a dream come true and also a wonderful experience. The headphones come with a special cord that allows you plug it in with aux. Which is what I would usually do with my old Razer headset.I literally loveeeee these, the music, the battery life, the reliability, the freedom, the sound, the list goes on, there‚Äôs no reason why you shouldn‚Äôt by these today, if you‚Äôre thinking about it DO IT. Best headphone experience I have ever had üíó thank you Cleer. I‚Äôm honored to use your product for my daily uses!üíï
Overall really good product. I would buy them again, for sure. I‚Äôm not an audiophile, but I know what I like. With the mobile app, the sound is pretty flexible for whatever you like to listen to. They‚Äôre not going to blow you away with bass, but there‚Äôs enough. With the settings right, the sound is clear and not muddy.  Mids are very clear, treble is just right.Battery life is astounding. ANC works well, ambient mode is good.Only reason for a 4 instead of 5 is these are heavy and hot. Of you‚Äôre looking for something to wear all day, these might not be it.Only re
These are comfortable and the sound quality is good.  However, the microphone quality is poor and I often have people I am talking to complain about my voice sounding far away or tinny.  If I cycle the power, then it usually improves.  The frustrating part is that I bought these to replace using my $30 earbuds for video meetings and but the earbuds still work better for calls because of the microphone issues.
The noise cancelling is good, there's a little bit of a hiss when it's active and i feel a bit of a cabin pressure at times. I don't use the NC feature for long periods at a time. I actually use the ambient sound more than the NC, and the ambient is really good imo. things come through naturally and it gives me good awareness of the environmentThe comfort is ok, for me the clamping force is a bit tight, especially with my glasses on, but over time it's getting better.The pads do cause ear sweat, so if you're in a warm climate, you can't get away from thatThe buttons are easy to use, and i much prefer them over touch based controls.multi device is good too, i get trouble at times connecting to my windows laptop, but i think that's a windows thing, or my specific wifi/bluetooth chip in my pc, all other devices it works just fine.the battery life is really awesome, in the month or so i have owned these, i charged it three times. the 60 hours battery life is legit.there's little to no EQ shift between the NC mode an the other modes so music sounds consistent.as for sound, it works for me. good highs and mids, clean tight bass. ( and the app allows you to EQ them, and the setting is saved on the device, so it's always there ) the bass is punchy, and it doesn't bleed into the other parts of the sound, i really just wish there was a bit more bass extension to get the lower sub bass frequencies. the lower rumble.call quality is good, for work, no one ever complained about not hearing me well.overall, given that these were on sale, it was not a buy that i regret, and i would recommend this product.last thing, i wished they didn't do away with the 3.5mm jack, but i keep the usbC-3.5mm cable in the carry case at all times.I have a couple things that i would like to see on the next version of these @cleer if you're watching.1) include a hard case with the product.2) more bass extension3) more fine tuning EQ. 5 bands just doesn't cut it, give us 8 or 12.4) work on the NC hiss and slight cabin pressure feel.other than that, very solid product. 8/10
There is much to like about these headphones. While, in the end, I passed these along to my wife, I found the audio quality to be quite good and the build to feel very solid. As wired headphones, which was my primary use, the sound profile leaned a little more toward mids and lows than I prefer, so I did not keep them for myself. My wife seems quite pleased after several weeks of use.
I bought these for the wireless feature and noise cancellation.  I fly a lot and cannot endure the baby crying for 2 hours.  The sound quality is outstanding!  Almost as good as my wired Audio Technica studio headphones.  I use these at work also to drown out my cubicle cohort eating efforts.  It does the trick.  They are good looking too!  Bass response is awesome!  I have fully charged these a couple times.  Battery life is amazing!
I bought these for my son since his 3 year old earbuds died. After 6 months of use he still likes them for use while walking around and commuting to class since they are wireless. The app apparently is worthless and doesn't seem to do much for him. Sound quality for instrumental music is great but vocals are flat. These do have a long battery life and he only charges them once a week. He does still prefer his wired headphones when stationary, no charging needed and sound quality is superior. Next time he will be buying his own and may try another brand.
Absolutely love these.  Comfort of the cushions is so soft around my ears.  When I put them on and turn my music on, I can‚Äôt hear anything around me other than music.  No family, no background, no distractions, I‚Äôm on my zone with my music.  The app -awesome.  Immediate changes apply to headphones.  Love the custom controls for the equalizer.  It‚Äôs not HEAVY bass boosted like the thump you would get in a car but the sound is rich and clean.  Definitely hear the quality.  It auto connects to whatever it was last connected to immediately.  So for me, as soon as login to my pc, connection.  Just like that.  No guess work.  It also works simultaneously connected to my phone.  If I‚Äôm listening to music on my pc and get a phone call on my phone, it rings in my headset.  Big plus to not miss a phone call while listening to music from a separate device.  The overall look and design is premium.  The box and packaging of headphones is premium.  It made me feel like I was opening an Apple product with unpacking my toy.  I have had beats headphones before and these are a really close comparison for half the price.  The bass knock though is heavier in beats.  The crisp sound of the audio is better with cleer.  Gaming, watching YouTube videos from a pc, if you‚Äôre playing a shooter game, there is a small, very very minor delay BUT that is ONLY because of Bluetooth connection.  If you connect the cable provided directly USB-C to 3.5 to speakers from a pc or directly to headphone Jack of pc (given you are close enough to the pc) there is absolutely no delay but that is a wired connection at that point.  And that‚Äôs only gaming.  There‚Äôs going to be a delay with any wireless Bluetooth in a gaming environment so I won‚Äôt take away for that.  But it is good to know if you‚Äôre considering this for gaming.  Overall very very nice headphones.  I may be buying another soon just to have for convenience of separating my work life from gaming life because I use them for both and would like a separate pair to keep at my work desk

Amazing headphone loveeee durable but I would replace the aux cord right away been only a month and already broke that has been a running theme with these and getting stuck in iPad or tablets so make sure you buy like a 6 pack of detachable aux cord standard 3.5mm male to male I believe should work.
After a month of using the headphones, the audio jack broke off inside the hole on my daughter's ipad. I reached out directly to the company via email (skipped amazon customer support) and they were very quick to respond and offer a solution. They recommended I take the ipad to an IT store to have the audio jack piece removed (the store removed the metal piece without taking the ipad apart & free of charge), they refunded my order for the broken headphones and shipped out replacement headphones the same day with quick deliver a day or two later. Amazon has a 30 day return/refund policy on this product but the company, Lilgadgets, has a 1 year warranty that covers defects. I took off 1 star for the fact that they did break and cause an inconvenience by having to take the ipad to the IT store but I would definitely buy this product again after such a great experience with their customer service.
Where do I begin. First of all these are an amazing quality. I'm an adult with a small head. I believe these are tailored for children so it worked perfectly for what I needed. They were incredibly soft and comfortable. Also I love the fact that they had brilliant color choices because black gets so boring and if you have to wear something like this, make it stylish! This company just gets it I think in terms of that observation and from what I've seen of their customer service .  They really do care about their customers.I ordered the green which is my favorite color and absolutely loved it. It looks exactly like it does in the pictures that you see so there's no filters used. I have to state that because I've ordered a lot of things recently where I can tell what I received was not what I thought I was buying. The sound quality was excellent, along with the volume controls and while I was listening to my audiobooks I heard absolutely nothing.They don't cancel out noise completely which is actually why I bought these. Since the quarantine started for us in March, my husband has had to work from home and unfortunately he only has one volume and that's super loud. I can't get upset with him for the circumstances so I have to try and find a way of dealing with it to get my peace of mind. I need peace and quiet and that's why I am looking into sound cancelling headphones.If you want to wear them around the house to block out noise without listening to anything, these will not particularly work for that. Then again I also have very sensitive hearing. My eyes are terrible so I suppose my ears compensate for what they can't do. But in terms of purchasing it to use to listen to audio books, movies or games for yourself or your child these are perfect and you will not hear anything else other than what is in your ears.Also the fact that there are two ports -one in each ear that you can plug in to so you can listen to what the other person is listening to I feel is an excellent feature to help children and adults be engaged with another  and share in a great listening experience whether it's a audiobook, music or movie.The sad part is I had to return these. Very reluctantly. I got into a bad accident over a year ago where I got hit in my Trigimenal nerve on my face. Pretty much I have a life sentence of nerve pain so anything on my left side of my face or my ear and jaw is incredibly uncomfortable. These were very soft but unfortunately still too hard for my medical situation because there's  sensitivity issues going on. Also since my ear also got impacted it's a bit jammed. I believe because these headphones are circular shaped that was the other issue for me. I assessed the situation and decided not only did I need something that was close to feeling non-existent on my face but either had no particular shape or had more of an oval shape because my ears are more along those lines. So with a heavy heart I had to make the decision to send these back and settled for the headbands with the earphones in them which seems to be working for my particular situation right now but do not nearly do as good of a job of canceling noise is these headphones do.If you don't have any particular issues like myself that are medical-related please consider purchasing these for yourself or your child and the colors are just amazing and they will not be disappointed. The quality cannot be beat. If I had a normal situation I definitely would have kept these.
I bought these for my daughter and she loves them. Easy to use and cleanThe volume also doesn‚Äôt go outrageously loud which I like
These are cushy and come in a ton of colors/patterns. I love that the cable is detachable and you can string them together.We bought these in December. The cable frayed in March. Not sure if my 7 y.o. was twisting it up, or what, since that seems quick, but then, my kid is rough on things. I Emailed pictures, the order number, and my mailing address to their customer service department and they sent me a new cable. Another 3 months goes by and the hinge breaks. I sent pics of that and they sent me a new set of headphones.We've got an expensive brand of headphones for my teen and when the hinge broke, we had to box it up and mail it in for a repair. Understandable, but a pain. I love how simple it is to just get another pair sent out with LilGadgets. I'm pretty sure my littlest could break a tank without trying too hard, so it's a life saver to have such an easy process for using the warranty. Quick response and no hassle. Two thumbs up in that regard. I'll be buying more of these headphones in the future!
Perfecto, mi hija qued√≥ contenta, buen dose√±o y buen sonido.
Para la escuela de la ni√±a. Muy buena compra
After going through multiple cheap headphones for my daughter to use at school we finally decided to spend a little more money and purchase these. The headphones have not only held up longer than all the others, they also seem to block out more noise so she can focus on her reading assignments/classroom work while at school. Worked so well we purchased the same kind for our other child.
Late writing this. We bought these for school. After a month the metal on the headphones came apart. The teacher sent them home. Still trying to get a replacement cord, which has not gone well.Aside from the cord, the headphones are nice, comfortable, and the sound is good.
Durable and sturdy for an elementary user. Like that the cord plugs in and works in either direction. Love that two headphones can plug into each other and then into the same device to watch the same movie. Genius. May have to get headphones for me so I can watch the movie too!

Quick Summary: (4/5)The Sony WH-1000XM3 is a great pair of headphones that hold their own against the tenured Bose. The Sony's provide a fun and full listening experience to a wide array of music genres that will make most perfectly content with their purchase. Bose's QC headphones will provde a more refined and pleasent listening experience especially for the discerning listener and will provide a stronger noise cancelling performance in a home or office setting. The stronger sound signature of the Sony will hold out better in a lounder atmosphere such as a plane, train, or automobile with its stronger bass performance. The Sony's lack the grace and balance of the QCs, but will provide a more familiar experience to the majority of listeners and will appeal more to someone who likes the sound of Apple's Beats, but is looking for a more professional or subtle design.Full Review:For the Sony WH-1000XM3 ($350), I will primarily compare it to the Bose Quiet Comfort (QC)($350) since even though they are all in the same relative price range, they are technically closer in price and age. I will also provide a little comparison to Bose's NC700 ($400) and Sennheiser's Momentum ($400) in the summary. Also, I will primarily discuss the pair of headphones in question and how it relates feature-wise to the Bose's Quiet Comfort (not QCII) headphones while refraining from giving too many details about the others, since you can read more specifically about those pairs individually in the review posted under their respective products. The reason for that is mainly to keep the review from becoming a master's thesis in subjective preferences. :)Initial Impression:Starting with the packaging. Simple and straight forward. The outer shell has a nice texture to it, but sliding out the insert with the headphones in it reveals a very simple package structure made up of just the case holding the headphones inside a box. However, the case itself feels really nice and has a sleek color palette. Very appealing to feel and look at in my opinion. Although the case is a touch bigger than the one for Bose's QC, it does a better job of holding its headphones. The QC's case always feels uncomfortably tight when putting them away. Sony's case neatly holds everything comfortably (without having to squish them in to zip it closed). The case is stiff, but not really hard. The inside is the same as the QCs with a soft microfiber feel to it. The headphones fold up inside with three little slots to the right for (inside to outside) the airplane adapter, 3.5mm aux cord, and USB Type-C charger cable.The Headphones:When I first picked them up out of the case, they felt nice. Soft plastic with a good feel to them. The plastic has a sparkle to it with a matte finish that resists fingerprinting decently. The band of leatherette on top is soft and has good cushion. Similarly around the ear cups. Very soft and nice to the touch. Not as stiff as the QCs. The click of the band when expanding it is satisfyingly stiff. At the top of both ear cups, you can see one of the microphones in a rose gold finish. Some other smaller holes are hidden around more subtly for the NC array. I feel this is a minor plus for the Sonys. The QC's microphones are a little more prominent and pick up wind a lot more outside. The USB Type-C port is at the bottom of the right cup with an indicator light. The left cup has the power button along the bottom back with the button for toggling the noise cancelling level just above it. Inside the ear cups, there is microfiber layer covering the drivers over a layer of foam. Overall the Sony's feel a little lighter than the QC's but also feel just slightly more flimsy when handling them. But the design is also more appealing and fluid and frankly more premium.When comparing the headphones while putting them on, the QC again feel more snug and naturally isolating before turning them on. The cups feel like they form a better seal given the stiffer covers and the QC also have angled drivers that leave natural room for your ears inside the cup, making the headphones not feel like they are sitting on your ears, but rather around them. The Sony are by no means uncomfortable, but may tend to be less comfortable for longer wear times and might make your ears prone to getting hotter.Sound Quality:For starters in this section, I will compare the noise cancelling. Upon turning the Sonys on, you are greeted by a woman's voice that sounds like it is in a tin can or cave when she speaks. When the NC kicks in, it does a darn good job of removing ambient sound and muffling people talking somewhat. It feels very close to the NC of the QCs, but I would still give them a leg up because the Sonys have a much more noticeable white noise factor playing whereas the QC feel more like they just sucked the sound out of the atmosphere around you. For the traveling folk (I primarily wear them in a typical office setting which any of these work plenty well for), I would say given the more aggressive, forward, pronounced sound stage with the Sonys, you will find them blocking sound better in a car or plane without the sound (especially on the lower, bass end) being washed out. The QCs have better NC, but the sound is softer in general so the sound still gets overwhelmed in a car/plane. I am not saying the NC is not doing its job, just that what you are left with is weaker with the QCs because the sound itself is subtler and more refined so you have to turn them up louder to make up for this.Now, it is difficult to judge sound since it is so subjective, but I will try to give my own impression of what each headphone may be better for. I listen to a wide range of genres, so I can appreciate many styles of music and how they are represented by different types of headphones and speakers. First, the Sonys bring a more forward sound. The sound stage isn't as wide as the QCs. Instruments get mixed together and lost in the fray. The sound of the Sonys feels more akin to that of Beats Studio. The bass is more pronounced and punchy which may be more appealing to some. If you prefer a balanced and clean representation, the QCs will serve you better. As you turn the volume up, the Sonys also lose more of their balance and can become muddy. The QCs give more of an impression that the music is playing around you, while the Sonys just feel like they're playing music. (if you really want to feel like you are on stage with the music, Sennheiser's HD800S is king. The HD700 or HD660S do a good job too at a better price, but these are all studio headphones, so totally different use case to begin with.)Where I really felt more of the performance shining through came in the Rap, R&B, or even some EDM/House area. I can definitely appreciate Sony more for some 2pac, Destiny's Child, Infected Mushroom, or Daft Punk. They are little too aggressive for music you may want a finer touch with such as jazz or opera. When listening to some Kenny G, David Benoit, or Keiko Matsui, you get that groove, but the fine details and intricacies of the instruments are sacrificed. Also, the sharp trills of the piano keys and saxophone are a bit much at higher volumes. The visceral in-your-face nature of the sound also makes them pretty fun for bands in the vein of Disturbed, Five Finger Death Punch, Pantera, and Metallica. Going a bit further that direction, with the likes of Eluveitie and Slayer it will be more likely to give you a headache from the unsubdued highs and thrashing sounds. Taking a couple steps back and going for some more classic rock like the Eagles, Journey, Gerry Rafferty, etc., the QC will perform better, but they are fine with Sony's headphones. Finally, when listening to music with a gentler atmosphere like Norah Jones, Ray LaMontagne, Ludovico Einaudi, or Celtic Woman, I would have to give it to Bose's QCs again but the Sony did liven them up a bit in a way.Features:Both Sony and QC have three levels of NC. High, Ambient sounds, and off. The QC handle this a lot better. The mid level for the Sony feels worthless and clumsy without audio playing. It almost sounds better being turned off. On the QC, the mid level provides a good balance and allows you to wear them outside on a windy day with reduced noise from the wind in the NC microphone. However, in the case of the QC (instead of the QCII), you need the app to change the NC level.The QC claim 20 hours of battery, which I have thoroughly proven to be true in the years I have owned them. Sony's claim 30 hours, which I have also found to be true, but I haven't had them nearly as long to see how they hold up over time. Also having had the QCs for longer, I have had to replace the ear pads after about 2 years. This process was easy and made them feel and sound new again with the better seal of fresh pads. The process for both headphones appears to be the same.Call quality is great for both headphones. I also use them for Skype calls from my laptop at work where they work great. However, this is one of those places the Sony completely dropped the ball. Bose's QCs allow two devices connected at the same time, and you can switch seamlessly between them which makes them great for the office. I have them on the laptop and my phone at the same time. I can listen to music while working. When its meeting time, I just join the Skype call and it immediately picks up. If I get a call on my phone, it switches back over. When I am done, music is ready to go. I don't have to touch anything. Next time I turn them on, it picks backup to the laptop and my phone immediately.Both charge fast. Just a few minutes will give me a couple hours of use in a pinch. Both also have apps. The Bose app is laid out better and more useful, but neither are really great or even necessary except in the case of the Bose being able to sync two pairs of Bose headphones to play the same music or audio through both. This may be a good deal for a couple seeking to both watch a movie on a plane or something. I have done this a couple times and it works well once setup. It is a nice feature in favor of Bose, but I haven't really found a lot of use for it in reality.For the Sonys, you have the features with the right cup having touch controls. This is fairly slick and works better than I expected. It only took a couple attempts to get the hang of it and it is responsive. Swipe up and down for volume. Swipe left and right for skipping tracks. Double tap to play and pause. And finally, if you hold your fingers on the right ear cup, it will turn the volume down and turn on the external microphone to catch ambient sound if you need to talk to someone really quick without stopping your music. A nice feature, but I personally haven't found much use for it. Might be useful for people in a bigger city like NYC walking around with the headphones constantly and you don't want to take them off every time you need to listen for a moment.Conclusion:Sony's WH-1000XM3 are no slouch and stand up for themselves at this price range. For someone looking for a pair of headphones with solid noise cancelling, flexible and diverse performance across genres and premium features, you won't go wrong with these. I dock them to 4/5 stars simply because in my own opinion, they fall short of Bose's QC series at the same price range in the overall quality and balance of the sound, noise cancellation ability, and the ability to connect to two devices at once and seamlessly hand off between them which is extremely handy for business people in today's multi-device world. Now, for my brief mention of the slightly more expensive options in the Bose NC700 and Sennheiser Momentum. If you are willing to step just a bit further up to the $400 mark, you will get even better quality, better noise cancelation, more premium feel and just overall better devices. However, I will propose that with the Sony or Bose QCs, you would not go wrong. For the majority of people, I would not say the extra money is worth it for the marginal increase over these headphones. It will mostly come down to your preference in sound.I will try to keep these reviews updated as time goes on and if anything comes up. Feel free to ask any questions and I will give a response when I can.
All right. I figure it's about time to write up a review of these headphones, seeing as I've spent some decent time with them and the Christmas sales should be happening and some of you may be wondering if you should spring for these - OR - wait it out until the next model Mk IV eventually shows up.The most frequent question I get is "How long do these last with Noise Cancellation on?"With the ANC (active noise cancellation) function ON - I've seen about 22-24 hours or so of Bluetooth-connected operation with these. The noise cancellation operation / ambient sound mode of these headphones are run entirely by the internal charged battery.Someone asked me a while back if with the headphones connected to your phone via the headphone cable, if they would still have noise cancellation / ambient sound mode even if the battery was dead and the answer is no, no they will not. You can still listen to music through the 3.5 mm physical cable with a depleted battery, but noise cancellation will not be available. Actually, you also can't use Bluetooth / noise cancellation when even in the process of charging these headphones‚Ä¶ (see "gripes" towards end of review).. so I guess it's good Sony decided to bestow a quick-charge 5-hour use time after a 10-minute charge function into these (using a wall receptacle USB adapter of course).Basically how it works is if you have an energized battery in the headphones you can use the noise cancellation and the Bluetooth connection - which also serves to activate the right ear cup touch-pad to perform functions on the headset.If you have an energized battery and decide to use the direct 3.5mm headphone cable to connect to your phone or computer instead, you can still use the noise cancellation, but the touch-pad will not be available to utilize as the cord now takes over for Bluetooth to serve music (and as it depends upon the Bluetooth connection to "talk" to the paired device for functions, the touch-pad is disabled).If you have a depleted battery you cannot use noise cancellation or the touch-pad but you can still get sound out of them like a regular pair of headphones by using the 3.5mm cable plugged into your phone or computer.The connectivity through Bluetooth seems really robust. I have had only one minor issue since owning these where the sound of what I was listening to hiccupped out for a fraction of a second a couple times, but I think it had more to do with my phone not behaving at that moment and not the headphones themselves causing the problem. Walking around inside or outside or for traveling, the connection has remained stable since.How "Good" the active noise cancellation works in any pair of headphones is somewhat subjective... but I can say these work really well, bearing a few things in mind and that we've not quite reached the technological level yet of producing truly silent headphones the quiets absolutely everything. Not for $350 dollars anyway.The headphone Manual itself states that "Noise Cancellation" works primarily in the low frequency band and that although noise is reduced, it is not completely cancelled.I can best equate the effect with just the active noise cancellation mode on and with nothing playing through them, to having a good set of hearing protection earplugs in your ears.Everything sounds reduced, especially things like dronning, humming, knocking and footsteps...there is a general quieter sound you experience, but you're not left completely oblivious to some noise coming through a little.These headphones will not surround you in a magical protective vacuum bubble when you have them on.However:The real magic happens when you start playing music through these headphones or listening to a movie or such. With the active noise cancellation diminishing the outside sound pretty well all on its own, the sonic enjoyment of what is playing through the headphones is not restricted at all... you get full volume, clarity and bass and that simply causes the outside world to melt away, leaving you with a little comfort-cocoon that really does impress.I have had very good success with these headphones canceling out unwanted noises and / or being able to enjoy what I want to listen to across a range of scenarios: Noisy Neighbors next door doing noisy things, kids pounding around upstairs in the house, traveling in the car (as a passenger of course - not driving!), a couple bus commutes, and so forth.As for the sound quality, I will say that they are very good. These are not high-end audiophile reference headphones costing thousands of dollars, but there is definitely high-quality audio out of these with a nice sound stage and separation with additional tweeking you can do through Sony's Headphone Connect application to adjust equalization and bass.These are not the loudest headphones I've ever used... I've had models that are almost obnoxious in their power delivery, to the point of being painful to listen to with the volume all the way up. I am the type of listener who likes a bit of punchiness in their music, but also appreciates nuances over ham-fisted bass slamming into my ear canals at the expense of everything else...and I will say that with the noise cancellation feature turned on, I'm actually enjoying music at a lower volume level than I'd need with other headphones. The WH-1000XM3's ability to effectively mute the outside distractions allows me to concentrate on what I'm listening to, and I don't need the volume cranked up to enjoy a range of music.I did have to tweek a few things with the app to suit my preferences, but I am left very happy with what these can deliver. Of note, you can set two "Custom" EQ settings in the app, so one you might use for punchier bass and the other for higher treble or vocal listening.The weight of these is impressively light. I might have been initially expecting them to have a weightier feel... maybe because I was thinking that with the added components necessary for noise cancellation, those would increase the headphone weight by several ounces. I'm happy to report that these headphones are able to be worn comfortably for extended duration with no feeling of pinched ears or sore spots. The ear cups on the WH-1000XM3's are of a more oval design than circular as found on my older Sony MDR-XB950BT headphones, and this makes them very comfortable to wear even laying back on a pillow or car seat. The thick padded circular ear cups on other headphones tends to press up against the back of a pillow or seat, and causes some pressure and discomfort against the back of my ears if worn too long when reclined.No such issues with these.I have seen a few complaints online about people reporting that their ears get warm after wearing these for a while. Having spent some time with these, I personally think it's the effect of just wearing a pair of closed-back headphones with snug-fitting padded ear cups causing this. Every pair of closed-back headphones I've worn with padding that encapsulate your ears will get to feeling a little warm after extended sessions with them on. For me personally, I have not had discomfort with these on even after a few hours of listening to music and watching a movie with the noise cancellation activated.The Phone Call microphone is something that many people seem to have initially hated on these headphones - many comments about how "it's garbage" and so on, reside on the internet.I am not sure where the hate is coming from, as I've had no issues making or taking phone calls with these, and nobody has complained about the call / microphone quality. Maybe Sony updated something in later production runs, but for whatever reason, the microphone seems fine on my pair. Certainly no worse than other headphones I've used. I will note that I did update the firmware to version 4.2.2 when I first fired-up the Sony App and when I used the headphones for the first time, so possibly that update may have corrected previous microphone problems.I have tested charging the WH-1000XM3's using an Anker PowerCore II 20000 battery bank and with a longer Anker USB-C to USB-A type cable than what Sony provides (see quibbles below), and they work together fine. The Anker battery bank will certainly output a 1.5 A current or more easily, which is what these headphones require for standard charging times.In conclusion, I am very happy with the Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones.Some people may consider these to be really expensive at $350 dollars US, but I don't think thats necessarily true. They're about $100 dollars more than other good quality headphones with similar performance sans active noise cancellation.Is the extra $100 bucks for having ANC worth it? To me, Yes. Definitely.The noise cancellation ability of these has allowed me to enjoy quiet time and listening pleasure that otherwise I wouldn't be able to have with regular headphones.You'll have to decide for yourself, but in a world with an ever increasingly loud and invasive noises you have to contend with daily, I've really really gotten to love using these, despite a few issues I don't really like.****************************************************Some minor quibbles:A literally 6-inch long USB-C to USB-A power cable, Sony?I just shelled out $350 bucks for a set of your headphones and you stuck me with a barely-useable power cable, never mind no included USB power adapter?You couldn't get the bean counters to authorize even a foot of cable? Jeeze.If you buy these headphones you are going to for sure want a longer USB-C to USB-A cable to charge these with.  Anker has some nice ones you can get right here on Amazon.The right-hand ear cup touch-pad is novel, and it has worked for me fine.My only little grumble about it, is the function to pause the music or accept a phone call requires you to do a quick double-tap with your finger on the center of the ear cup touch-pad. Problem is, my ear is in there and the sound of my finger quickly tapping it makes a loud "Thump-Thump!" sound I find annoying. I would have MUCH preferred a physical button instead.I picked the "silver / grey" model color of these headphones, simply because they looked a bit different than the boring ol' black every other headphone comes in. I have noticed that depending on the color temperature of the surrounding light, they can appear to look anywhere from a silver / grey coloration to more of a champagne / very light tan in color. It's not off-putting, and I do like the color of the headphones... but some of you may not appreciate the reactive effect these have in either cool or warm colored light.  Figured I'd mention it.My big gripe: You cannot CHARGE these headphones and at the same time, listen with them using Bluetooth or with the ANC on. That seems backwards as Hell to me, considering I probably own at least 10 other electronic devices that CAN be used WHILE they are charging. My Smart Phone, yup. DSLR camera, sure. Voice Recorder, indeed. Graphing Calculator, Uh-huh. Sony MiniDisc Player from literally 15 YEARS ago? YES.So why is it that with these modern $350 headphones, you can't plug them into a usb wall adapter, laptop, or battery bank with a USB-C cable and keep enjoying ANC and Bluetooth connection and listening enjoyment while charging? The moment you plug the USB-C charging cable into these, you lose all Bluetooth and ANC, and the sound shuts off until you stick the physical corded 3.5mm cable into the audio source‚Ä¶which at this point means you're now using a pair of regular headphones because again: No Bluetooth, no Active Noise Cancellation going on.Very very strange, and although with 20+ hours of listening on tap with a full charge, I still question if this isn't something that really should be improved upon with version Mark IV.Wishes for FUTURE:  Improved ANC with better elimination of higher pitched / sharp noises, maybe an available headphone stand that can provide the headphones with some type of inductive charging might be nice. Oh, and let us be able to charge AND listen to these with Bluetooth / ANC active at the same time please, Sony.
I currently own about 30 headphones of various brands and types.  I have tried many Bluetooth headphones and own the Bose QC35 II and Bowers and Wilkins PX.  I bought both the Sony WH-1000x MKI & MKII but returned them after weighing the shortcomings vs the cost, my main complaints being comfort and sound (the ANC was always good).  My portable-everyday-beat-them-up headphones were the Bose QC 35 II.  I liked them primarily for the comfort and ANC.  The sound on the Bose can best be described as adequate but generally lifeless.  Always in search of something better I read a couple of ‚ÄúFirst Look‚Äù articles about the Sony WH-MX1000M3 and decided to pull the plug on the first day that they were available on Amazon.  When I received the Sony‚Äôs I was pleased to see that the case was similar to the Bose QC 35, a little bigger but shaped well enough to fit comfortably in my backpack.  When I removed the headphones and put them on my head I realized immediately that these would be as comfortable as the Bose.  Good job Sony.After charging for a couple of hours I paired them to my phone and went to my headphone test playlist on Spotify.  My main complaint with the previous Sony model's sound was that they had very little soundstage (defined as perceived distance between your ears and the music) and little definition (defined as the clarity and separation of the various instruments in a piece of music).  The M3 sounded better than the previous Sony‚Äôs and better than the Bose, but the highs appeared to be quite subdued and overwhelmed by the bass.  This was disappointing.But, Sony has a phone app that allows for EQ so I go download the app.  Frustration. The app did not recognize the MK3.  Patience.  I figure that Sony has not updated the app yet.  So I wait a day and see that the Sony app has automatically updated on my phone.  I open and hurray! It is recognizing the MK3 now.  Now I can play with EQ:  -1 on 400 Hz.  +1 on 1K.  +2 on 2.5K.  +3 on 6K.  +4 on 16K and ‚ÄúClear Bass‚Äù remains at 0.  Play music and now were talking!  I‚Äôm not going to say that these sound nearly as good as most of my wired headphones, but for everyday-on-the-go-beat-them-up-with-ANC these are exciting.  They blow the Bose away.  The Bowers and Wilkins PX which weigh about three times more than the Sony‚Äôs have decent BT sound when the ANC is off but the sound changes considerably and not for the better when you apply one of three ANC modes.  They PX is OK for about an hour of no ANC listening while sitting at home, but after that my ears and the top of my head hurt.The noise cancellation of the Sony is a generation ahead of Bose.  There, I said it.  Most reviewers crown the Bose as the best ANC you can get.  Well,  Sony has just showed Bose that they are the new big boy on the block.  I did some A/B comparisons with both headphones and realized that the Sony not only cancels steady noise like jet engines or the sound of the air conditioning intake in my condo, but it does a great job of virtually eliminating all other sounds, including television voices and even other people, as my wife can attest to when she had to stand in front of me and wave her hands to get my attention because I could not hear her talking (so, if you want to block out your wife‚Äôs talking‚Ä¶ LOL!).  And this is without even messing with the settings in the app.  Others reviewer here have not had the same experience, stating that it does not cancel voices.  I frankly did not expect it to cancel voices, but I must say that the Sony comes as close as anything I have ever not heard.So, if you want very comfortable headphones with the best sound and Active Noise Cancelling that you can expect with wireless Bluetooth in 2018 get these.  They will not sound as good as wired closed back or open back headphones, but ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt always get what you want‚Äù, ‚Äúnothing is perfect‚Äù, and ‚Äúeverybody is different‚Äù.In addition to the Sony WH-1000XM3 during this review period I used:Bose QC 35 IIBowers & Wilkins PXBang and Olufsen H6 (wired)Sennheiser HD650 (wired)AKG 7KXX (wired)SpotifyFlac files on phone and desktop computerUPDATE 2018-09-21:  I did experience an issue with phone calls where people at the other end were hearing an echo of their voice.  I tested the headphones with three different phones and the problem occurred with all three.  So I replaced them through Amazon.  I am glad to say that the new pair does not have the issue.  After some tests with phone calls I will say that Sony still needs to do some work on the call quality at the other end of the call (the call sounds fine in the Sony itself).  In this regard, the Bose QC 35 is better.  I think the call quality is really with the sound processing that Sony has implemented and not the hardware.  Hopefully this will be improved in future firmware upgrades.  Another minor con that the Bose handles better is the support for multiple BT sources.  But this is a minor annoyance and I only use the Sony's for my phone anyway, so I am not constantly switching sources.  Small price to pay for better ANC and musical sound.
I had Bose headsets for travel for over 20 years. I had Bose QC-1, QC-2; I still have QC-20 wired earbuds and aviation headset A20. Recently, I had a challenge of finding headset which not only works to cancel noise in an airplane, but which also works better than earplugs at home, especially to reduce noise of piano played in a different room. I compared Sony 1000XM3 with Bose QC35 and 700 at a store, bought two pairs of Sony, and compared them with Bose QC-20 and A20. On top of that, I did tons of research.To begin with, Bose used to be "the king of noise cancellation" for many years. This reign is coming to an end: the competition is fierce. In pro aviation world, Lightspeed created a strong competition to Bose, while in the consumer world, Sony came up with a product widely superior in noise cancellation. Bose tried to answer Sony with Bose 700, but it is still inferior in noise cancellation and usability and features of the phone app.According to independent testing data available on the internet, Sony's noise cancellation is up to 6 dB better than Bose. If you are not familiar with dB scale, it is a log scale, and 6 dB is a little more than a factor of 2. Noise cancellation efficiency is frequency dependent, so it is hard to compare apples to apples.  Power spectrum across all frequency gives an about 2 dB advantage to Sony (29 dB compared to 27 dB of Bose 700), in low frequency range Sony beats Bose with a high margin (about 6 dB), in high frequency range Bose appears to be better. Yet, when you put Sony on your head, followed by Bose, and switch back and forth, Sony is impressively better. Like, way better.  Tons better. So much better that you sometimes wonder if Bose is turned on at all.Comparing Sony XM3 with Bose QC20, Sony is better in all respects other than small size and weight of QC20. Noise cancellation is better, and sound quality is better. Comparison with aviation headset A20 shows that A20 is slightly superior in terms of noise cancellation (and, surprisingly, even in sound quality), probably due to a passive noise cancellation component - but A20 is a $1100 headset with a massive wire and console, and connectors are not compatible with consumer electronics. You would never consider it unless you fly an airplane as a pilot. High frequency hissing, which existed up to QC15 and still present in A20 (introduced in 2015) is almost gone in both newer Bose and in Sony. Difference in noise cancellation quality between Bose A20 and Sony XM3 is worth maybe $50, but not $800. I think we are talking about several dB, nothing major.Sound quality is subjective. Neither Sony nor Bose 700 are audiophile grade. One cannot tell the difference while playing music via Bluetooth from a phone, but plug them with a cable into a headphone amplifier and play 24/96 music, compare with Hi-Fi headphones (I have good old Sennheiser HD-620 which used to be in the top 10 best some 20 years ago; not anymore, but they are still great sounding high end headphones) - and you can tell immediately that these are not Hi-Fi headphones. Not even close. With a good sound source, they sound dull and sound stage is not there. But they sound well enough for daily use, for playing music from the phone, certainly better than most earbuds. Sony sounds a little better than Bose 700 to my taste, but it is close, very close, there are small difference in color of the sound which are very subjective. I rated the sound five stars because this is not a Hi-Fi headset, it is a noise cancelling headset, and the price is determined primarily by its noise cancellation abilities.  As long as you can listen to music and enjoy it, as long as it does not sound like cheap earbuds, it is OK. For really high quality of sound without noise cancellation, there are much better options in the same price range.App is not required with Sony and Bose (despite misleading information on the web, either headset can be used without the app), but Sony app is much better. It does not require registration and has many more features, including adjustment of noise cancellation to ambient pressure.Sony, to my surprise, works very well for phone calls in the office environment. There were many reports that Bose was vastly superior, perhaps this is the case when one needs aggressive noise cancellation, like on the street among cars and people.  Or maybe Sony made updates to firmware which fixed the issues which they had. When answering calls at home, the sound quality on the other end of the line is excellent. People cannot tell I am wearing a headset.Comfort is purely subjective and depends on one's head size and shape. I have a big head, so most headphones exert some pressure. Sony is no exception, but I am fine with that. I must say, the most comfortable headset for my head is Bose QC 35 II, followed by  Sony XM3 and followed by Bose 700. Bose 700 feels a tad cooler on the ears.  A20 creates too much pressure on my ears.For travel (e.g., vacation) QC20 is hard to beat, due to their very small size. They are inferior to XM3 or latest Bose, but do their job well enough. For use at home or in the office, bluetooth headsets with better noise cancellation and better sound and with the ability to make calls are the way to go.Finally, cancellation of piano sounds. My wife teaches piano full time from home. Sound is a problem in our home. When I am in the same room as our grand piano, I can hear it loud and clear, although much less loud than without the headset. However, when I go to my office and close the door (which is a glass door which only partially blocks the sounds), I can barely hear it and can focus on whatever I am doing without distraction from the sounds. I tried QC20 for this purpose, and they were not quite up to the task. I got the 33 NRR rated 3M earplugs, and they also were not perfect either. I can tell that Sony XM3 works better. I would not use XM3 to work with power tools, though. They are too expensive and possibly too fragile for a workshop, and the benefit is not large enough to warrant the difference in price.Build quality of Sony seems to be better than Bose (and less expensive, too). The headset is made in Malaysia. Bose, I must say, can make great quality headsets (A20, with 5 years warranty, is an evidence to that), but consumer grade headsets always had an almost marginal quality. Bose, by the way, does not repair them once they are out of warranty. They make you buy new ones with a discount. Two of my old Bose headphones broke and I had to replace them because repair option was not offered, and lifetime of synthetic leather ear pads was too short for a quality product. It is too early to say how well Sony would last - we will see.After buying the first headset on Amazon, I got another one for my son. My son absolutely wanted Bose, but after comparing them side by side in a store, and listening to mine, he said, I still like Bose, but I recognize that Sony is better in all respects... So we got him Sony from a local store.The only frustrating part is that Amazon has dropped the price by $50 after I bought both pairs! What a bummer - but now, Bose is completely not competitive.The only downside which I found so far... Sony can connect to two Bluetooth devices simultaneously, but it is confusing how the preference works (the one connected last has the higher preference for audio), and there is no easy way to change the preference or even disconnect a specific sound source. You cannot do it in the app. I think Bose is the same way. I also struggled with connecting to my desktop PC for audio and gave up attempts to set up the audio preference correctly. Either I did not figure out how to do it correctly, or something can be improved in the next releases of the App and firmware. I am sure it will be done, eventually.For what it is worth, competition between suppliers is good - it drives features and quality up and prices down. I hope, Bose will catch up eventually - they missed the opportunity to do it with the 700. Sony 1000XM3  remains the best product in this class for second year in a row.
Around the holidays, I decided to treat myself to a pair of high quality headphones. I live in the central area of a major US city, and to be frank the noise pollution was driving me a little crazy. I was interested in a pair of headphones that would give me some peace and quiet, so I spent a lot of time looking at ANC (active noise-Cancelling) options and the Sony WH1000MX3 and Bose QuietComfort 35 II were easily the top picks among reviews.However, there were a lot of different opinions about which was better. The split was pretty 50/50 between the Sony and Bose, so I was pretty torn. Even though they were heavily discounted for the holidays ($300 each after taxes), that's a lot of money considering I generally never spend more than $50 for headphones. So I bought them both as an experiment, with the plan to return one after I made a decision.Let me get this out of the way now, because I'm going to get pretty detailed below. Ultimately, I understand why there's such a debate about whether the Sony or Bose is better. They are both fantastic headphones and I love them both. I love them so much, that I made the probably financially irresponsible decision to keep them both! They were both so good, but in better than the other in completely unique ways. For that reason, there is no dealbreaker that makes one better than the other -- I believe it comes down completely to personal preference and that's why there is so much debate on which is better.The TL;DR of this review is that you should buy the Sony if you value sound quality most, and don't plan to wear them for long periods of time (i.e. over 5-6 hours per session). You should buy the Bose if you value comfort the most, and if you're planning to use them for phone calls.If you're interested in a bit more detail, I'll give my opinions on these aspects: ANC, Sound, Comfort, VersatilityANCThe noise-cancelling on both of these is phenomenal. I had assumed Bose would do better at this since it's what they're known for, but I'm surprised to say the Sony's ANC is slightly better. It does a bit better blocking out non-drone sounds (i.e. people talking, sharp noises, etc) compared to the Bose. With that said, they both are practically equal and I don't think the Sony ANC is so much better than the Bose that it would justify buying them on that factor alone. When wearing either pair, I sometimes feel like a spaceman walking around my apartment because everything is so quiet.SOUNDThis is a clear winner for Sony. No questions asked, the sound is clearer, crisper, and deeper. This is especially noticeable when watching movies/TV shows or playing video games. With the Sony, I feel like I can hear each individual sound clearly, whereas with the Bose everything is a little more muddled together. With that being said, the Bose sound is perfectly acceptable and even 'good'. It's just that for a $300 pair of headphones I'd expect a more premium quality where I am amazed at how clear the sound is. The Sony does that; the Bose are a tier below.COMFORTHands down, the Bose are better. I can literally wear them for 14 hours and they don't bother me except for needing to give my ears a little air every once in a while. I have never, ever worn a pair of headphones this comfortable before. I'm especially grateful for this comfort now that I'm working from home all day because of COVID-19. The Sony headphones are a bit heavier and clamp on your head a little bit more tightly. They also press down on your ears, whereas the Bose are deep enough that my ears don't even touch the inside of the cans. The Sony are still definitely comfortable, but a tier below the Bose. I can still wear them for about 6 hours before they bother me, so if you don't wear headphones that long it might not be a problem for you.VERSATILITYThis is just a catch-all for all the other aspects of the headphones. Nothing here I would consider a selling point strong enough for most people to make a final decision, but if you have specific needs then this might be helpful.1. I like the physical buttons on the Bose more than the touch buttons on the Sony. They just work better, and I make mistakes with them less often.2. Sony has better technology. They use USB-C so the headphones charge faster than the Bose mini-hdmi. They also have better bluetooth connection technology, which lets a higher bitrate of audio transfer wirelessly. Without getting too technical, I think this is a major reason why the sound quality on the Sony is better.3.  Bose is better if you want to connect to multiple devices. Bose can connect to two devices simultaneously, but Sony can connect to only 1 device at a time. For example, if I am listening to music on my computer and I get a phone call, if I'm wearing the Bose, I can answer and talk on the call through my headset, and when I hang up music will resume. With the Sony, I'd either have to disconnect from my computer, then reconnect to my phone  before the call ended, or take off the headphones completely and answer the phone separately.4. Sony looks a little more stylish and futuristic. The Bose look like an ordinary pair of headphones. Build quality is identical thoughCONCLUSION5 months after buying these, do I regret keeping them both? NO! They are absolutely worth the money if you have it. Generally, I find that I wear the Bose throughout the day as I'm working from home. They're really comfortable to wear all day long, if I get a call from a co-worker I don't need to take them off, and I'm just listening to music as background noise while I work so sound quality isn't important. After dinner, it's always the Sony. When I'm focusing on a new album, watching a movie, or playing a video game, I really value how good the sound is. And generally I only wear them for 3-4 hours at this point so discomfort is never an issue.If you twist my arm about it and made me pick only one pair to own the rest of my life? I'd probably take the Bose just because I wear them so much while working from home. But that's not a fair metric, and each individual will have a different primary purpose for these and that should be your guiding principal when making the choice.Good luck! (longest review over)
I'll preface my review by stating that these are my first pair of bluetooth cans, as well as first pair with noise cancellation. I travel for work quite frequently and have been wanting a pair of noise cancelling headphones for quite some time. Like most, I was between the Bose QC35 ii's and these Sony WH-1000xM3s. I visited a local store and tried out both. My initial conclusion was that the Bose cans are more comfortable (lighter, deeper ear cups), but with weaker NC and a more neutral sound signature. I ended up ordering the Sony's and now have used them for 3-4 hours/day since receiving them.Build Quality/Materials - Initial thoughts upon unboxing - these are solid. The soft touch plastics used feels durable and of good quality.  These do not feel cheap to me whatsoever. The detents on the headband are well defined and feel like they'll hold up to daily adjustment. Sufficient padding on the headband as well. The ear cups are well padded and the synthetic leather feels of high quality. No creaking or odd sounds when flexing these way past what normal on/off the head use subjects them to. Only time will tell how these hold up to daily use, but I'm happy with the build quality out of the box.Fit - I have a large head. I wear a size 7-5/8 fitted baseball cap. My longest continuous listening session with these thus far was ~4 hours. No major discomfort to report. I had no fatigue along my jawline from the ear cup clamping force, and zero discomfort along the crown of my head. I will say, my ears/head get warm with these on for extended periods of time, even while stationary. When moving around the house, I started to sweat a bit. I do tend to run hot but regardless, these are a warm set of cans. I do think these will be just fine for stationary use (such as on a plane) and that's how I intend to use them 95% of the time.Noise Cancellation - One word: Wow. As mentioned above, this is my first pair of headphones with noise cancellation. I fly a lot for work and wanted the best of the best in this category. My old Sennheiser HD 429s, which are over ear/closed back, but have no noise cancellation, only really drown out ambient noise when listening at 80+% volume, which is not ideal for hours long flights. After watching the numerous comparison review videos on YouTube, and trying both the Bose QC35 ii's and these cans in store, I feel I made the right choice. The noise cancellation is truly remarkable. The quick attention feature works great as well. I can cover the right ear cup and ambient noise/voices become almost immediately audible. I've tried the Ambient Sound Mode around the house and I will say, that even with "Focus on Voice" selected, I have a hard time hearing someone speaking to me if the music volume is above ~20%. I have a flight next week and will amend this section of my review after with my thoughts on the NC on a plane.Sound Quality - I've been leary of bluetooth headphones for fear of sound degradation due to the wireless connection. My iPhone 8 Plus doesn't have a headphone jack and I've been forced to use the dongle to listen to my Sennheisers, which is less than ideal. After my first listening session with the Sonys, I can confidently say that to my untrained ears, the 1000xM3s absolutely blow my wired Sennheisers out of the water in terms of sound quality. Yes, these are 3x the cost, but I'm still incredibly impressed with the sound quality here. As others have mentioned, these were a bit bass heavy for my tastes out of the box. However, the Sony Connect app gives full EQ control over the sound profile of these cans. In my opinion, the user control available in the app truly pushes these headphones to the next level. Everyone's musical preference is different, and you have full control of the sound with this app. I'm all over the place with my music - from progressive jazz such as Pat Metheny, to the fast and furious riffs of Mastodon, to the undulating bass lines of Flamingosis and Jazzinuff. These headphones deliver! The bass is punchy (and heavy at the upper EQ levels), mids and highs come through prominently and clear, and the soundstage is spot on for my ears.Pairing & Battery Life - After unboxing, I powered on the headphones and connected them to my iPhone. Pairing was quick and painless. Battery life was at 60% out of the box. I plugged them into a 5V, 1.5 amp power adapter for 10 minutes, using the included USB-C cable, and the headphones were bumped up to 80% battery level. It seems the quick charge claims of 5 hours playback in 10 minutes of charge are valid. I've since listened to them for a total of ~15 hours, and the battery level is showing 30%. The battery level changes in 10% increments. So for my use case, 50% battery loss over 15 hours of listening = 30 hours assumed playback with a full charge. Bang on to Sony's claims. All of my listening has been with Noise Cancelling active, and anywhere from 30 - 70% volume. I'll top these up to 100% battery prior to travelling and will report back with observed battery life for a full charge.Included Accessories - The carrying case is what I expected. I see it holding up to travel just fine. The internal cable pocket is a bit tight but fits the included cables without much fuss. The included USB-C cable is shorter than I'd like, but seems to be of good quality. The included 3.5mm cable has a straight male connector at one end (for connection to the headphones) and a 90 degree connector at the opposite end. It's an acceptable length.Other Notes - I've yet to make or receive a phone call with these on. One of the most talked about negatives, at least in the reviews I've read, is how poor the microphone quality is on these headphones. I don't ever plan to take phone calls with these on, so this was never a factor in my purchasing consideration for these. But, I'm sure at some point I'll test out the mic and will report back. Lastly, single device connectivity - I only ever listen to music from my phone so this is another non issue for me. Just to try it out, I did switch listening from my phone to my laptop, and it took maybe 45 seconds to disconnect from one device, connect to the other and then start playing music again.In conclusion, I'm VERY impressed with these headphones. The noise cancellation is top notch, sound quality for a music enthusiast (read: NOT an audiophile) is excellent, the Sony Connect app is feature rich and gives the user full control, the carrying case is sufficient/in line with other headphones of this class and the build quality is great as well. Only time and use will tell how these hold up in the long run, but so far, these are hands down the best headphones I've ever had the pleasure of owning.
I'm not writing this review for any type of financial gain and I bought the headphones for market value. Naturally the opinions expressed are mine and my audio preferences may differ from yours. I have a pretty good ear for sound and have a background in home theater and audio sales and setup. Now for the review.After reading many reviews and doing more research than was probably needed I decided that Sony and Bose were the top 2 contenders. My wife had recently bought on Amazon the Utaxo, which have good reviews, are cheaper, and when I took them on a flight I was satisfied with their performance (for the price) and without a comparison to other headphones. I abused BestBuy and their return policy and purchased the Sony and the Bose. In the store I sampled the SkullCandy and they sounded bass-heavy and not clear, so I didn't include them. I also looked at the Jabra's, but after reviews believed they wouldn't be as good and left them out as well. So, I decided on the top 2 contenders and then theBeats because I see so many people wearing them, and the Utaxo for those looking for a budget set. I created a spreadsheet to help guide me and used it loosely. I attached it so you can see a little of what I was testing.If you want the quick and dirty, I'd go with the Sony. Bose is 2nd. Beats 3rd. Utaxo 4th, but a good product for the price.Years ago I was in search of good wired headphones and compared the Audio Technica m50x against Monster, Senneheiser, Beyerdynamic, Monster, Sol, VModa, SkullCandy and a few others. I ended up with the Audio Technica (AT), and I mention that so you know my sound preference. I like more of a neutral sound with full range vs too bright or too bass heavy. Let's start the review. Here are the more detailed reasons for each headphone and why I chose them...Comfort: Bose wins here but marginally. Most headphones irritate me to some extent as did the Bose, but Sony was a close second. Beats were about as comfortable as my Audio Techica's (AT), which aren't horrible by and means and Utaxo was basically tied with beats. Both moderately comfortable and I did wear the Utaxo's for an entire flight without taking them off. (4 hour flight)Passive Isolation: I used various white noise, airplane sound, background voices. Again, Bose has the slight edge with Beats trailing. Utaxo were comfortable enough, but by comparison, last place. Utaxo were comparable to my AT's, which I didn't realize how little they block out. Not great.Active Noise Reduction: I placed Bose first, but only by a hair. I had my family try the comparisons and some chose Sony, some chose Bose. They reduce at different frequencies so you can hear some sounds more on each, depending on the background noise. Both are excellent. Beats again comes in 3rd and wasn't a close third. Utaxo did a moderate job, and as I said, I was happy using them on the plane but didn't have anything to compare to. For a budget set they do the job. The winners and absolutely impressive are Bose and Sony. Maybe a tie.Sound: This is probably the most important aspect of any headphone to me. I spent hours listening to different types of music. I had cables connected to each headphone and could quickly go back and forth between each. No, I couldn't put an SPL meter on each time to ensure the volume was exact but I did use the same source material and feel I have a pretty good feel for how they all sound. In the end, this is why I kept the Sony's. They aren't perfect and they aren't audiophile quality but they are really good. The most similar to my AT's. I found the Bose to be very sibilant at times with female vocals or tracks that had high frequencies in them. It happened time and time again and was the deal breaker for me with the Bose. Sony was more neutral, had adequate bass but didn't over-emphasize the higher tones. Less ear fatigue for me in the long-run. Beats were better than I was expecting. They also had some tendencies to boost the higher tones but had good bass. The Utaxo were good enough but just not impressive. Again, I was fine with them when I had no comparison but head to head they just don't compare favorably. The Sony app also has an equalizer feature that is super quick and easy to use, has some fun (not very useful) things like surround sound, soundstage localization, and a few other somewhat gimmicky features, but is much better than the Bose.Features: I didn't test the voice features on any of the headsets. It isn't that important to me. After using the Sony's for a few weeks, I do like the touch feature and the ability to hear ambient sound by placing your hand over the right ear cup. I also enjoy the Sony app, whereas the Bose app was lacking. Bose has the traditional buttons for volume which work fine but I did prefer the Sony touch interface more. Utaxo has standard buttons as well as the Beats, all work as intended.Conclusion: The Sony and the Bose are very close and though the Bose may be slightly more comfortable, the features and especially the Sound on the Sony pushed me towards them. The ability to equalize on the fly very easily is a great feature that Sony includes in the app. The touch interface is more user friendly than Bose or the others. Beats are a fine set but I'd pay the extra $70 for the Sony. If you find a pair at a great price, you wouldn't be disappointed. The Utaxo, at around $60, are a bargain and a good set of headphones. If you never have a chance to compare you would likely be satisfied with them. They are built well, are comfortable enough and put out good enough sound to enjoy music and video. But they do place a distant 4th in terms of isolation. First Place: Sony !!
I will preface this review by stating that I own and have reviewed a great number of headphones in the past. It does not make me neither an audiophile nor an expert but it still gives me a lot of good reference.For each use, there must be a type of headphone. If you care about only the review of the Sony WH1000XM3, you can skip the following explanations.Open, Semi-Open or Closed headphones, what is that?- Open headphones are good for audiophile uses. It will yield the most fidelity to the sound but these headphones are generally meant for quiet rooms, for being used with an ampli and a DAC and for a very good audio source. These headphones will also give you the largest soundstage (the impression that the music comes from the room itself).- Closed headphones are meant to be used in noisy environments. They usually do not give you the best soundstage but you can still get a good sound. They will have much less sound leakage than the open ones.- There is also semi-Open which is a trade of between the two above.Intra-Auricular, Around your ears, on-ears, earbuds, what is that?- There are much different formats of headphones.- Intra-Auricular are the ones that go into your ear canal. They usually need a good seal to provide the best sound, especially bass. They will be the ones blocking the outside sound the best.- Earbuds are usually more generic buds like the ones that come with your phone. Usually their quality is not fantastic, except rare exceptions. Their price is generally low.- On-ears are headphones where the cans are going on your ear. They can sometimes not be too comfortable due to pressure on your ears but they are usually quite light.- Around your ears are headphones with very large cans that will encompass your ears completely. That is usually the category of preference for Audiophiles due to the large size of the drivers (50mm).Then you have the connection to the sound source:- Wired: the oldest and simplest one. Some have a remote and mic, some do not. Historically these are the ones giving you the best chance to have an optimal sound quality.- Bluetooth are wireless headphones that need power to work (batteries). The sound quality and battery life has greatly improved in the most recent years. Yet, a wired headphone will usually deliver the best sound.Last is the noise cancellation:- ANC: Active Noise Cancellation is a complex algorithm that select the frequency bands to ‚ÄúMake disappear‚Äù to allow you to listen your music in the best conditions. Although this technology has greatly improved, the resulting sound quality will never be as good as without ANC due to the difficulty in not cutting frequencies that were part of the music. Another misunderstanding is that ANC does not cancel voices so you will still hear babies crying in the plane, and even better than without it.- Passive isolation: Is usually achieved by intra-auricular buds that work as earplugs. On the ears headphones can also have a fair isolation due to the thickness of the earpads.The Sony WH1000XM3 falls into the ANC Wireless Over the ears category.Now onto the Sony WH1000XM3.As I stated, I own a very large collection of headphones, enough to last more than one lifetime so I have stopped buying more, except for when I feel like I could get a real benefit from one.It was the case for the Sony because I fly international regularly and it is always good to have a good noise cancellation in the plane when your trip last more than 8 hours.I had another passenger letting me try his pair at my request and I was favorably impressed by the comfort and noise isolation so I decided to indulge.Here is what I like about it:- Amazing comfort. I have no idea what the earpads are made of but it is a true pleasure wearing them. The pads wrap neatly around my ears with very little pressure on them, the top band does not put too much pressure either.- Best ANC I have ever experienced. The difference prior to turn it on and after is nothing short of amazing.- Very good sound. The Bass will please bassheads (listening to All the Stars from Kendrick Lamar and the bass is blasting my eardrums). The mids are very good too‚Ä¶ The highs may be the least impressive but the sound is overall excellent.- Fair price. I own more expensive headphones that are not as comfortable, do not have ANC and do not sound as good‚Ä¶- Good app. Easy to configure. Pairing was easy- Nice carry case with everything you need while flying.- Battery life is of about 30 hours when in use. It will decrease slowly when not used but not by much.- The controls are very nice too. I love the cupping of one ear to allow a temporary muting of the sound to discuss or listen without turning it off or removing it.Here is what I like less:- Absolutely nothing!In conclusion:A resounding 5 stars.This headset is not only good for travelling but at work too and even at home‚Ä¶. Love it!
The Sony WH1000XM3 headphones are 1/3 of THE trifecta of wireless headphones, including the Sony offering, the Sennheiser PXC550 headphones, and the Bose QC35-II headphones. I have been able to try all three, and can say that the Sony headphones are the winner for me.NEGATIVES:(1) I really only have found one and it's rather glaring -- these headphones can only be paired with one device at a time.  Meaning that if you've already paired them with your phone, when you want to use them with your laptop you have to completely go through the pairing process all over again.  And once you have it paired with your laptop and want to go back to your phone, you have pair everything all over again.  I really can't believe Sony botched this feature this badly, and I really don't know what they were thinking.A minor negative is that the Sony headphone app is not compatible with Android on Chromebooks. Although I have a monster bulky Asus ROG gaming laptop, I mainly use my Acer Chromebook while on the go, and although the Chromebook runs Google Play Android apps, the Sony headphone app reports that it's not compatible with this device.  So when using these headphones with my Chromebook, they're aren't anywhere near as tweakable as when I'm using it on my phone.  I'm sure it would work with a genuine Android tablet, but I don't use Android tablets anymore since I got the Chromebook.Another minor annoyance is the tiny little 6" (at best) USB-C charge cable that Sony includes.  It's just simply not convenient to charge these headphones on such a short cord, and it really would've only cost Sony maybe pennies to include a more standard 3' cord.POSITIVES:(1) These headphones are very comfortable to wear, even for longer periods of time. They are just slightly less comfortable than the Bose QC35-II headphones, which feel like magical unicorn sparkle angel pillows on your ears.(2) A big thumbs up for future-proof USB-C charging! I haven't found any other brand of higher end headphone using it yet, so I suspect that Sony is the first.(3) The ANC feature is superb -- definitely equal to, if not actually superior to, the Bose QC35-II headphones.  And the app makes it even better by allowing you to tweak it to your personal preferences.(4) Another big thumbs up for Sony making the wired cord 3.5mm to 3.5mm rather than having a more proprietary (and difficult to replace) 2.5mm on one end.  Again, I'm pretty sure Sony is the only one doing this in higher end headphones for some reason.(5) Sound quality is excellent and in direct comparison I think it's better than the Bose QC35-II. I realize this is rather subjective, though, but I really have nothing negative to say about Sony's sound quality, whereas I felt the Sennheiser PXC550 sound quality was rather poor.(6) Sony put the right amount of touch controls and hardware buttons on these headphones.  One thing I really didn't like about the Sennheiser PXC550 headphones is that they didn't have a hardware on/off switch and instead the power option is built-in to rotating the ear cups.  That just seemed like something that would quickly break and I also never did figure out how I was supposed to turn off the headphones while still using them wired.  There's simply no way to turn them off.  Sony has a dedicated hardware power button, as well as a multi-function button that can be setup (via the app) to control ANC or digital assistants, etc.  So far I haven't had any problems with accidentally activating a touch function. Volume, skip, and pause touch functions have all been very responsive.(7) Although I'm not using the included case (I bought a 3rd-party case that I like better), it's still a really nice case.  I think the Bose case is nicer, but the Sennheiser case was just pathetic and wasn't much better than a bag in terms of protecting the rather expensive headphones.Overall, without getting into too many specifics about the other two headphones, I rate the Sony headphones as the best for me.  The slightly beat out the Bose QC35-II headphones in terms of ANC as well as sound quality, and there's simply no comparison when it comes to Sony's touch controls and superior USB-C charging.  The difference between the Sony headphones and the Sennheiser PXC550 headphones was like night and day. The Sennheisers had vastly inferior sound quality and horrible comfort to the point that I couldn't even really test/compare the ANC because there's simply no way I could keep the Sennheisers on my head long enough (the ear cups are actually painful).  It was also a nice touch that the Sony headphones came to me fully charged, whereas the Bose and Sennheiser headphones were only partially charged.  Who wants to wait to fully charge their new device?So, in summary, the Sony WH1000XM3 headphones slightly nudge out the Bose QC35-II headphones, whereas the Sony headphones obliterate the Sennheiser PXC550 headphones so badly that they really aren't even in the same category.
I purchased these headphones after seeing a lot of reviews online and because it was on sale. I couldn't help it. I've tested them for a couple of weeks now, and I think I can give a good review by now.They replaced my Bose QC25 headphones that I loved but that I wished to be wireless from time to time. Since I've used those headphones for years, my review is comparison between the two brands and is probably going to be helpful for people that are deciding between these and the Bose QC35 II (please note that every other headphone in this price range is just pale compared to these). Also, I don't know much about Bose 700 since I haven't tested them extensively, but most of the things that apply for their older version is probably true for these as well.The Negatives:----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Not as comfortable. They are very comfortable, but not as much as Bose. After a while I can feel them in the top of my head and I do feel the headphones in my ears. Bose are almost perfect here; I can use them for hours and hours and only get hot in the ears if the day is really warm.- A little loose. The clamping force is a little lacking. When looking down or headbanging you can feel them move around and even fall. I didn't have this issue with Bose.- Earpiece cushions harder to replace than Bose. After over a year of use my Bose cushions started wearing down until they finally broke. After a $12 dollar replacement purchase, I easily replaced them and they were as good as new. I don't know how much it'll take for these cushions to wear down, but when they do, it's going to be much harder AND expensive to replace (I've found the replacement cushions at $50 and I've been told they are not as good affecting the noise cancelling quality).- Single button to turn on, off and get into pairing mode. It's not a major issue, but having to press for two seconds to turn on/off and seven to get into pairing mode is not great. With Bose after a while you automate the motion of removing and turning of the headphones in one move. I've forgotten to turn these off more often than not because of that which of course impacts battery usage since they are on while they are still connected to a device. You basically waste hours of battery because of this. Pressing for two seconds might not sound awful, but it's that compared to a switch interaction of instant results.- Bluetooth management!!!! This is were this headphones are really poor compared to Bose. They cannot connect to several devices at once, and to switch you must somehow cut the connection with the other device. So, to connect to a device you had already connected to, you need to manage at least 2 devices but most often that not 3. You need to cut the connection from the headphones to the previous device (either turn off the device's Bluetooth or press the On/Off button for 7 seconds to enter pairing mode) and then grab the other device and connect them to the headphones. Bose products have a memory of connections, once connected, the device will remember and to connect to a device you only need to single press the Bluetooth button; the headphones will announce a device name, and if you wait the headphone will connect to the device (as long as it has Bluetooth on of course). If you deal with several devices at once like phones, tablets and computers, Bose approach is unquestionably better; if you only use one device or don't mind using the cord for the others, this is no real issue. For me, if I had known, it would have probably been a deal breaker. I just thought that Bose's way was the standard. Also... Bose products connect to 2 devices simultaneously.The Great and awesome:++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Sound quality! In general very similar to the QC series, but with better base. These sound slightly better than Bose which is an impressive feat. Getting either one of these headphones spoil you and ruin every other headphone.+ USB-C for rapid charging. It's great to know that little time of charging will allow you to use the headphones for a very decent amount of time. Probably more than necessary until there's actually time to properly charge them.+ Touch controls for Media controls are really great. That is way more comfortable than having to double or triple press a button to do a trivial task.+ Standard 3.5mm headphone jack!!!! It may sound stupid, but it's great to know that you are guaranteed an easy and quick replacement for the cable if needed. Cables should be able to provide even better sound quality than the best Bluetooth transmission algorithms. Weather that's noticeable with this headphones I don't know. But you can get a cord as long as you want for this headphones whereas with Bose you are basically stuck with the provided length since they use a 2.5mm jack.+ Outstanding noise-cancelling capabilities. Probably the best I've experienced so far.+ Outstanding Battery life! Batteries were never an issue for me with the Bose because I had 4 rechargeable batteries that I rotated fairly easily. The battery included with these headphones lasts a really long time (20 to 30 hours) so I don't usually find myself in the need of recharging them when I wanted to use them the most.+ I'm not going to continue describing good things, because that's what the product description is for.Hope this helps.

These headphones have one key feature and that's why you are here. They are over ear workout headphones and they do it well. I am in the USAF and I work out a lot, like a lot a lot. I sweat like a busted fire hydrant and these headphones have not broke yet. Had them for about 3 months. They fit snug on my head and the band can be tightened to seal for smooth heads.I came from the wh-1000xm4 and xm3 because they both broke within a year of use. Sure sound quality and noise canceling is better but if they don't last a year of working out it's not a good set of headphones.The Plantronics have good sound quality. It's not going to blow you away but the bass is bassy and the mids are good. Make sure to download the backbeat app for your phone and play around with the equalizers that come preloaded. I chose the middle equalizer for better mids as the headphones can get louder in this mode. I mostly listen to techno, metal, ska, country and podcasts while in the gym and it blocks most of the sound in the gym and I usually have them at 85% volume.Overall really nice for the price and they feel super high quality. I like it more than my Sony headphones.I will be back at the one year mark to update my review.
I bought these after researching over the ear headphones that I could use during resistance training, as well as working outside, in the yard, washing the car, etc.. I have other Bluetooth headphones, the Sony WH 1000-MX4s for travel and commuting, but they aren‚Äôt moisture resistant and are also too expensive for me to beat up on around at the gym or while doing yard work. Given my intended purpose, ultimate fidelity, state of the art high resolution and most up to date connectivity isn‚Äôt a priority for these. I just want to be able to rock out while I work out or in the yard. Active Noise Cancellation wasn‚Äôt a priority either so these seemed to be a quality option at a really good price. And that is certainly what they are.I have no issues connecting and staying connected to my single device iPhone.  The sound quality is actually very good. I have no complaints at all. Bass is solid, treble is clear and balanced without being shrill or bright. Voices are accurately portrayed and appropriately placed in the headspace image. Soundstage is not overly large, which is how I prefer my headphones.  They block out environmental noise well, but can‚Äôt comment on commuter, city or airplane drone.  They are also very comfortable, sitting nicely and softly around the ear with nothing rubbing or irritating the external ear or at the headband.  I would like a bit more clamping force personally for the gym as they do slide around some with exercise but I have a narrow, shaved head which might have something to do with it.Telephone calls provide clear speech from the mic as well as in the ear cups. The max volume, like many models, probably isn‚Äôt as loud as some may like, but that‚Äôs probably best for the ears and the battery. I do listen loudly and could certainly tolerate max volumes, but keep.it at 75-85 % most of the time.I haven‚Äôt had them long enough to comment on battery life, so perhaps I‚Äôll revisit this review at some point in the future.All in all, at the sixty dollar price point that I paid, I don‚Äôt think you can be disappointed in what these cans offer. Solid build quality, great sound quality, exceptional comfort, adequate noise blocking, water/sweat resistance all at a phenomenal price point is a win on all fronts. Competing models were no less than twice as much and some four or more times the price of these. It was a no brainer for me and if you need the same feature set, I can‚Äôt recommend them highly enough, nor they can they be matched for the price I believe.
Was always an in ear guy for gym workouts. But they always slip off slowly. Over the ear always made my ears hot and sweaty. These are perfect. Very light and comfortable and not too hot. Audio is good enough and good bass. Battery life good. No noise canceling but never used at gym anyway.  The mic is mono sounding if using to hear your surroundings.
This is a great product for the price. The sound is great, the bass the highs, and the lows, whatever you're looking for in a pair of headphones for the price this goes above and beyond. For jogging its snug but not headache snug and I can wear it for at least a good hour before I need to take them off to let my ears breathe.
These headphones are a great deal. Considering what they cost versus other decent quality OTE headphones. Easy to use and the app is great. The only downside For me I‚Äôd I wish they were louder. They are loud enough to cut grass while wearing just wish there was a little bit more top end. Freq response is good and sound quality and call quality are great. Would recommend.
They have pretty good sound quality, no real complaints there.  I will say that for those that comment with "omg if you need to turn these up further then you should get your hearing checked!" that I cannot agree with this.  The headphones could indeed sometimes use one more "up" on the volume depending on the music and other factors.  I'm not hard of hearing in any way, they often hit the spot exactly where I need at max volume when I, say, start a work set where I want them really going.  But sometimes they are just a tad quiet.  No big deal tho, I can still hear them plenty fine and you can get an app for that of course if it bothers you.By far my main problem with them is that the volume controls simply don't work that well.  They definitely sense my movements, but maaaan the number of times I swipe slightly horizontal and it restarts a song when I just want to turn them down.  Or on overhead/reaching exercises just the brush of my shoulder will pause the music or skip/restart.  The former scenario is a frustration multiple times each workout, the latter is more situational.  Yes, I fully admit I could be more precise but even when I try specifically and slowly to perform a function I often get the opposite one.  Even harder if you just completed something very taxing and you want to adjust your music.  Sadly after a year of use I more or less feel I had gone with non-touch controls because dedicated buttons would have been great instead otherwise for this headset.
This is not for someone who is looking for studio quality sound during a work out. This is not noise cancelling and my airpods get louder, but I needed something that wasn't going to fall out of my ears when I was sweating and something that would go over my head. Gets the job done, durable, I haven't had any issues.
I have had these headphones for about a month, and I am content with my purchase. I was looking for sweat/water resistant, over-ear headphones to use for workouts without much concern for premium sound quality (the sound quality on my Bose SoundSport wireless earbuds is better). For $99, the value is better than OK. I have not tried cheaper over-ear headphones but I think these would have been a better buy in the $79 to $89.PROS-They stay comfortable throughout my workouts, which usually last about an hour. I do not have issues with them sliding off nor do I have issues with my ears overheating (if that is a thing that can happen with over-ear headphones.) Plus, they stay relatively dry and ear easy to wipe off.-The ear cups fold inwards to make them more compact for storage and transport. When folded, they fit well in an inner pocket in my drawstring backpack.-I have not yet tested the full extent of the battery life but they can easily go a week (3 to 4 workouts) without being charged.-They get loud enough to drown out normal gym sounds in addition to the music being played over the PA system. I read some comments stating that the sound volume is weak but there is no way I could have these on my ears at full volume without ending up with some hearing issues.-There is a feature called OpenMic that allows you to let surrounding sound in. So, instead of taking your headphones off or using the volume control to turn music down, you can hit a button to hear someone talking to you.-The touch controls make it easy to adjust the volume, pause/play music, and go to the next track.CONS-The touch controls make it easy to accidentally adjust the volume, pause/play music, and go to the next track. Additionally, when trying to press the button to use OpenMic, you can end up accidentally changing the volume or stopping the music.-If I am doing an exercise that requires lying down then there seems to be a change in sound quality.OTHER STUFF-I downloaded two other apps before I found the correct one. The correct app is dependent on what model of headphones you have. I am not deducting starts for that because I probably should have just paid more attention to start with, but it was an annoying process.
So either I'm going deaf or just like really, really loud music, but I find these a tad on the quiet side. It's not so much an absolute scale as a relative one. These have a 40mm driver. My two other pairs have a 50mm driver so it's not altogether unexpected.After that's out of the way, I got these to use for working out and for that purpose, they work very well. They stay on my head as well as any headphones do and they don't make my head hurt like others would after an hour so that's a big win. Bluetooth connection is solid and they have a great range.I LOVE the touch controls on the side. I hate going back to mu computer (I don't use a phone) to skip a song. I much prefer the ability to quickly swipe to advance it. Skipping, repeating and pausing tracks is about all I use it for since I leave the vol at max all the time, but these make it easy to control those functions. I don't think they're oversensative at all. I've read where people have complained about accidently changing the song while adjusting them, but if you just adjust them carefully and not like an angry gorilla you'll be just fine. It never happens to me.The little string stretchy thing is a probably well-intentioned, but a gimmick at best. I makes zero difference as far as I can tell.They are very lightweight.My ears do get a little sweaty and hot, but no more so than with any over-ear alternative so they're aces on that front comparatively.Battery life seems legit. I prefer to keep them charged, but I let 'em go on the first charge for a while and they went forever.The open mic thing is kind of a funny concept. It basically inputs ambient sound through a mic and straight into the phones. There is a slight delay. When I'm deadlifting with that mode on, I slam the bar down like a couple miliseconds before I heard it, but it doesn't bother me. I don't use it that much, but to those for whom this is a required feature, fear not. It's good enough.They're worth a try if you're on the fence. Return them if you don't like them. That was my plan and I'm closer to buying a second pair than returning them.
Good, solid headphones. The only issue I have is that I keep hitting the stupid touch buttons on the side and stopping or skipping songs.

I can‚Äôt recommend these highly enough. Best pair of headphones I‚Äôve ever owned. If you don‚Äôt want noise canceling headphones, these are the way to go. Fit comfortably on ears. Not in ears or around ears. I can still hear what‚Äôs going on around me. There are buttons on the headphones to play/pause, adjust volume, and skip tracks. Charging for a Few minutes yields hours of battery life. A full charge lasts for over 24 hours.
It's about time someone came out with a good pair of bluetooth headphones without the ridiculous price tag.  I got these because the pair I had of a different brand for 10 years always kept cutting out during playback.  When the problem got worse I graduated to this pair and it's like night and day.  These have an actual bass punch and high end crispness my old ones didn't have, and two days straight listening all day at work and not ONE cutout.  Was relieved the problem was the old cheap headphones and not my new smartphone.  I've only had these a couple of days but I'll tell ya they are pretty good so far!  As far as battery life, it looks like there won't be a problem.  I turned them off at last break today after having used them for about 6 hours, and when I turned them back on it verbally told me it was still fully charged.
Pretty decent headphones for the price. I use them for the gym, so they serve their purpose. I did notice that the sound has more of an echo compared to the MDR-XB650BT Sony headphones I had previously. Not sure if that‚Äôs something that can be adjusted.
a little flimsy i didn‚Äôt expect that but otherwise very good sound and battery life, some noise canceling not mind blowing
Definitely a step up from their regular wired ones you see at the store.
perfect
I just got them and tried them on they were really easy to connect and they were already charged they had 100% which is really convenient :) I haven't tried the noise cancelation though I didn't even know it had but overall I liked the sound quality better its better then my air pods pro which costed me 200 these 60 dollar headphones are amazing :)
Honestly they are a bit small, and I have a smaller head. These are my sitting around headphones, so I couldn‚Äôt tell you if these will stay put if you‚Äôre moving around. It‚Äôs Bluetooth connection can be slightly wonky, but the sound is really good. Battery life is fantastic.
liked the sound quality and the battery life is good .  noise cancellation was not as good as expected.
I bought these as a replacement for an Mpow bluetooth headset from a few years ago. These are great for the price, though the ear pads are a little small. The plastic arms look a little fragile and I can see them cracking easily if you're not careful.Battery life is really good. After a week of use they are still at full charge.The mic sounds odd on phone calls and has a lot of echo. I'm not sure yet how to fix it.The sound quality is ok, but the bass level is a little too high compared to all the other sets I've owned.Overall these are good for the price, but I'd rather buy the Mpow again (if they were available).

V-MODA Crossfade LP2 headphones purposefully designed and not to be confused with other heavily fashion-marketed, color-coordinated plastic garbage!I am not a highly respected audio engineer, conversely I am merely a simple man that has spent 25+ years in an exhaustively expensive quest for great sound.  For starters let me share some of my favorite bands that I used to evaluate these cans.  I frequently listen to hard-rock bands such as Judas Priest, Godsmack, and Dream Theater to the more subdued Mark Knopfler, Adele and David Gilmore to electronica/techo of Depeche Mode, Madonna and Christina Aguilera.  If you like this type of music, like it loud with bass, then...read on and buy these headphones.Merriam-Webster defines Discriminate as: to notice and understand that one thing is different from another thing: to recognize a difference between things.It bothers me when people do not discriminate especially when it comes to something as important as music.  Unfortunately, in the past I too have failed to discriminate when selecting/purchasing audio gear.  I have fallen victim to ostentatious product reviews and have allowed myself to be persuaded into believing that some products are perfect for all music.  The old adage, you get what you pay for, is mostly true but the notion that a high price tag equals good sound quality can vary greatly with headphones and speakers, simply because musical taste varies greatly and headphone manufacturers cannot design a product for all tastes.  I have owned at least a dozen pair of headphones over the years to include all the big label brands such as Sennheiser, Grado, AKG, Bose, Koss and Beyerdynamic.  They were all great headphones, but they just did not perform to my tastes.‚ÄúV-MODA Crossfade LP2‚Äôs recreates the front row rock concert experience with deafening power and low end frequency response‚ÄùThe standard goal of any speaker or headphone is to produce a flat frequency response, V-MODA‚Äôs produce a standard loudness contour which is something I try to replicate via tone controls or equalizer settings on my home audio equipment. These are not headphones for studio recording/mixing, instead the frequency response favors a very human-centric appeal. That said these cans will provide a new level of enjoyment and appreciation for your music collection.  I typically do not play music at excessive levels but as a test I really pushed these headphones with my Denon home audio pre-amp and then amplified through a FiiO A-3 headphone amp (great addition-more on that later).  These headphones cannot be overwhelmed when played through a clean source.  I have worn these headphones while physically mowing the lawn and been magically transported to the front row of a Volbeat concert. V-MODA Crossfade LP2‚Äôs recreates the front row rock concert experience with deafening power and low end frequency response.‚ÄúThe isolation is so complete and sound quality so amazing you will lose yourself in an another dimension‚ÄùIsolation is the key to great sounding audio and something the engineers at V-MODA have accomplished.  V-MODA‚Äôs have a closed ear design which eliminates most external noise and distractions, in fact the isolation is so complete and sound quality so amazing you will lose yourself in an another dimension and become enveloped in the music.  My family doesn‚Äôt share the same love for rock music as I do and rarely allows me to play my speakers to the level I enjoy which was why I have been on a quest to find headphones that can produce high volume levels, excellent sound quality and not wake the neighbors with my late night music sessions.  The V-MODA‚Äôs come about as close to inner ear bud sound quality as it gets but with the ability to produce an incredible amount of distortion-less low end that can be felt.I will also provide a brief warning that should be heeded when listening to these headphones; I have enjoyed these headphones early in the morning while reading email and have been quite startled when my wife taps me on the shoulder.  Additionally, I would encourage new users to break-in your headphones.  Headphones and speakers all benefit from ‚Äúburn-in‚Äù where music is played continuously for >20 hours.  With headphones this is easy to achieve, simply plug them into a source and continuously play music at a moderate level.  You will find the bass extension and sound quality smoother and more responsive.ConstructionOne complaint I have had with other high-end headphones is the deceptive appearance of quality manufacturing concealed in flimsy plastic construction or cheap construction concealed by the addition of external fashion accoutrements.  I have the simplistic expectation that headphones costing >$100 should be well engineered, comfortable, durable and faithfully reproduce music.  I understand the need to make headphones light and comfortable but it should not be purely with the goal of weigh savings thereby sacrificing durability.  V-MODA has produced an incredibly well designed headphone with an aluminum padded headband, solid swivels and leather coverings.ComfortEven with the noticeable mass of these headphones they do not feel heavy.  The aluminum headband keeps the headphones in place with a gentle snug fit.  Typically closed ear headphones can be hot and exhausting especially after extended wear.  At no time did I find these headphones uncomfortable even after 3+ hours of listening.  That said I did opt for the XL ear pads which provides more room for your ears to fit inside the headphone without being compressed which may have something to do with the comfort I have experienced.  Then again there are definitely gym headphones.‚ÄúYou probably won‚Äôt see V-MODA headphones around the neck of your favorite basketball player‚Ä¶‚ÄùAnother thing that has taken hold of the headphone market is this crazy notion that in order to be an amazing athlete you must have a pair of fashionable headphones around your neck, CRAZY!  You probably won‚Äôt see V-MODA headphones around the neck of your favorite basketball player because you are not paying for the marketing, you are paying for quality. That being said V-MOTA‚Äôs are still highly customizable with interchangeable outer shells in a variety of colors.I put the included gun metal plates on to see how they looked and chose to keep the subdued flat black covers on.  I prefer the purposeful industrial look of this product as if V-MODA owes its design cues to the stealth aircraft industry.  Furthermore, the V-MOTA‚Äôs are not overly large or distracting looking.  Unlike some of headphones on the market that are insanely large with enormous pillows over each ear, if I saw someone wearing these at the airport I would not give them a second look.What‚Äôs includedThe V-MODA Crossfade LP2‚Äôs includes an impressive hard shell case, two removable Kevlar wrapped cords; one 6‚Äô cord, a 4‚Äô cord with a microphone/mute controls and a 1/8‚Äù-1/4‚Äù adapter. You also get 2 extra gun metal outer shell covers.UpgradesI am not a fan of the included cords and opted for a shorter 3.5mm Auxiliary Audio Flat Cable with a 90 Degree Right Angle Compatible which works great for walking around with an iPod in your pocket.  Additionally, I purchased a FiiO A-3 headphone amp and FiiO L9 L-Shaped Line Out Dock (LOD) Cable For iPod which makes a huge difference in the sound quality.  The Crossfade LP2‚Äôs will play just fine through iPhones and iPods just not very loud.  The amplifier increases the sound pressure and low end without having to push the solo iPod to the maximum limit which adds distortion and reduces battery life.  The combination is a bit bulky but manageable.  Clearly users of these headphones are not looking for super small portability and space savings, focusing more on sound quality I would hope?!ConclusionThere are a lot of headphones to choose from on the market and while there are some excellent highly marketed brands out there I would caution would-be buyers from buying purely on name, price or personal recommendation from anyone that likes different music than you.  The V-MODA Crossfade LP2‚Äôs are not what I would consider an overly expensive investment for the tremendous return in sound quality.  It would be difficult to find headphones anywhere that offer the level of customizability or durability found in the V-MODA Crossfade LP2.  These are headphones that are built for portable high-end audio and truly transform with the addition of a headphone amplifier.  Last, if you are looking for a pair of cans to rediscover your hard rock, dance or electronica/techno collection, look no further.  In my opinion the V-MODA Crossfade LP2 are the best headphones for the money on the market today.  Strap them on and disappear into a color saturated realm of blissful musical reproduction.
Box: If V-Moda‚Äôs intention was to get my undivided attention, they succeeded!Case: Hard-shell case molded to the shape of the headphones, a place to store the headphones, accessories, and a strong zipper to seal the deal. The look of the case is so stealthy, you might even lose it!Look & Feel: When you open the case, you immediately get presented by V-moda‚Äôs signature style. The stealthy black look, with the chrome accent, the classic V, and the words V-moda on the headband. And when you feel that 90% all metal construction in your hand, you know you got something that is quality! V-moda likes to call the metal that is in their headband, memory steal. They act as if they patented the material, when in reality, it is spring steal, which has been around since the med-evil ages, for use in the making of European swords.Size: The V-Moda‚Äôs are a very slim headphone for being over the ear. If you bring a portable amp with you, these would be a great option for portable use. One of the things that I didn‚Äôt like about my JVC‚Äôs, is that they were huge! The ear cups extended at least 5-inches off my head and I looked like an ATC operator lol. The weight of the V-moda Crossfade LP2 cans, are 260-grams, which is nearly half the weight of the JVC SZ1000 can‚Äôs, which weighed 450-grams.  So, weight wise, the V-Moda's are a lot easier to tolerate.Headband: While the V-moda LP2‚Äôs may not feel like an endurance test in the weight, they are however in the headband. Holy moly Vmoda, what were you thinking! These can‚Äôs were clearly designed for children with small heads in mind. I got the headband fully extended to 12 clicks, and it barely fits my head. I wear these things for an hour, and my head is already hurting from the headband. So V-moda, your all about styling but no padding, message received.Pads: Again Vmoda, what the heck? This is a 150 dollar headphone, yet it has pads like a 20-dollar cheapo. So if your wondering if you should order those V-moda XL black memory cushions, the answer is absolutely yes.AMP: I am powering these can‚Äôs through a Fiio A5 amp, capable of 1-W at 16-OHMS, and 800-MW at 32-OHMS, which is all the power these babies need.Equalizer: I am running the audio signal to the amp from a vintage Realistic 12-band equalizer, that would put any software EQ APP to shame without breaking a sweat.Sound: Listening to a few music tracks of various types, I felt the highs were muffled, I like my highs crisp like nacho chips, I don‚Äôt like them so flat its like listening through a marsh mellow. (Suddenly I just got an urge to eat marsh mellows, weird) I razed the 3K to +4DB.. I razed the 5K, 9K, and 16K to +8DB. Now that my highs have been crispy-fried, its time to move onto the sub-bass levels. I have the 36HZ and 63HZ set to +10DB. What does all that mean? Prepare to enjoy life is all I am saying.I loaded up my favorite bass track, Wiz Khalifa On My Level ‚Äì BASS BOOSTED! I was really surprised that a 50mm dual diaphragm driver, was able to hit just as hard, as my old JVC SZ1000‚Äôs, which had 55mm Kelton Nanotube drivers! I don‚Äôt know what magic this is, but I freaking love it. I just cranked it up and let the bass God‚Äôs take my soul! Ohhh, I‚Äôm on my level alright‚Ä¶The next thing I wanted to test was the mid-range, no better way to do that, then to watch a video where men are speaking. Stock out of the box, these can‚Äôs made men‚Äôs voices sound like their grapes were shriveled up, that just aint right! So I razed the 110Hz and 190Hz to +4DB, that instantly fixed it, they sound like men again.My consensus is that the stereo separation is actually pretty good, but I don‚Äôt think its the best with the stock pads. I‚Äôm sure there are some open-end Sennheisers that can smoke these can‚Äôs in that area lol. As far as surround sound, I got to be honest, it wasn‚Äôt quite reaching to the level that I would call full surround sound. Lets just say these can‚Äôs have limited surround sound. LOLUHT: If you search Youtube for Ultimate Headphone Test, this is a great test to see what frequencies your can‚Äôs are able to actually produce. Now keep in mind, these V-moda Crossfade LP2‚Äôs have a frequency response rating between 5-hertz to 30K. I ran the test to see how high these could go, and they actually topped out about 15K, (Could be my hearing though) not quite their rated 30K, but most humans can‚Äôt hear in the 20K to 30K range anyway. Then I wanted to test how low I could still hear sound from these cans, and I was able to hear sub bass at levels down to 10HZ before the sound dropped out.Sound Stage: Sound stage is OK, but I don‚Äôt believe its anywhere near what you would get from a 500 to 5,000 dollar pair of high end, open-end, set of can‚Äôs. These can‚Äôs are meant to be bass canon‚Äôs, not bring John William‚Äôs 200 person orchestra to life. However, after modding the can‚Äôs using the V-Moda XL pads, the sound stage opens up considerably, and there is better separation.Isolation: Isolation in these cans is just OK, its no where near as good as other over ear can‚Äôs, such as my old JVC‚Äôs. You are going to hear more noise from the background of the room enter the can‚Äôs. A lot of this is due to the fact that the stock pads don‚Äôt seal around the ears properly, due to their small size. Additionally, if you turn these can‚Äôs up too loud, another person in the room will be able to hear them, if it is quite in the room.Modding: I wasn‚Äôt even going to touch the low quality aux cable that came with the can‚Äôs. I‚Äôm using the Ivanky 8‚Äôaux cable with 24K gold-plated 3.5mm connectors, that delivers all the power that these V-Moda's need. I have also upgraded these can‚Äôs, using the official V-Moda XL black pads. Not only does this make these can‚Äôs much more comfortable to wear, they improve the sound-stage, they improve bass accuracy, and increases vocal clarity.Conclusion: So, what are these headphones best suited for? As with all bass canon‚Äôs, these are best for Hip Hop, Rap, Dubstep, RNB, Rock, Reggae. Forget listening to Classical, Country, Folk, or any sort of soft rock or pop, look elsewhere if thats all you listen to. I‚Äôd like to see these sold with the XL pads, instead of offering it as an option. I‚Äôd like to see some actual padding on the headband! I like that these use a detachable cable, that gives us options, and its good that the pads are replaceable too. I like that these are real bass canon‚Äôs, they should satisfy any basshead out there. Just remember to amp them and EQ them well. I love the durable metal construction with military grade certification!4 out of 5 stars is my rating...Recommended!PS: I'm waiting on a pair of Wicked Cushions to arrive, I've learned that they are supposed to be the best cushions for V-Moda headphones.  ;)
I am a college student and I like to listen to music on campus.  I usually use them for music, videos, and sometimes gaming.  I have had these cans for nearly a whole year now so now I feel like it's a good time to finally gave my review.  As a background, I am not an audiophile.  I do not look for the best and most expensive headphones.  I look for the ones that give the best sound for the money.  I seek for an uneven balance between performance and cost, performance being higher than the cost and luckily I stumbled across these bad boys.  This headset was the perfect match for me.  It offered high quality sound with high quality design at a price point that would make your wallets happy.Let's start with the most important factor when it comes to audio headsets like these.Performance: Compared to my other headsets that I have used in the past mainly for gaming, this one takes the cake.  It offered incredible full stereo sound that sounds very crisp and clean.  It has a very balanced sound and the bass has boom.  The bass is just right and is not overpowering.  I have used 3 headsets before.  The Plantronics Gamecom 780, the SteelSeries Siberia V2 usb 7.1 version, and the Sennheiser HD201.  I rarely used the Sennheiser so I can't really compare much but all I remember is that that one seems quiet and delivers average sound.  The sound details on that one isn't that great and the bass seems to lack as I can recall.  Both the Gamecom and Siberia performed better than the Sennheiser as the Sennheiser model is the HD201 which is very cheap and low end model.  The Gamecom and Siberia both deliver Stereo and also 7.1 as an option.  The V-moda LP2s may not have that 7.1 channel for virtual sound however on its own it sounds slightly better than those two with 7.1 virtual surround as I have tried them all for gaming mostly.  Still, you can get a 7.1 surround for the LP2s if you have the software or some adapter for it.  I use the Razer Surround Pro edition software and it works nicely.  Overall in terms of performance, the V-moda LP2s outperformed all three headsets.  It has excellent lows, great mids, and great highs.  When I go to the gym, I like to play my old gaming music from my childhood.  I would blast hd remasters or remixes of soundtracks from Castlevania and Final Fantasy series.  They get me pumped up when I train and it sounds phenomenal!  I also listen to anime music and also EDMs.Build and Design Quality: When it comes to build and design quality, I give it a 9!  The V-moda LP2s feel and look very high end and premium.  It has a sexy black look and hexagonal cups that make it shout the word "SEXY!" and it is just SEXY!  Granted you can also order and customize the metal plates outside if you wish.  Oh and not only are these SEXY but these are BEAST!  It is very TOUGH in build quality.  They design this with like the HULK's soul embedded into it or something as these are built like tanks.  The material is mostly metal and some plastic but the plastic is very strong and high quality.  Also the weak spots to wear headphones tend to snap are reinforced with more plastic and metal.  The wire is braided like the cord of a high end gaming mouse and the plug is gold plated so that's a plus.  Oh and I forgot to mention the headband/headrest on this is very flexible and can flex a lot with no breaks.  All this high quality material on it makes it seem like it's a heavy thing to wear but it's NOT!  It's AMAZINGLY LIGHT!Comfort: I have NOT used these with the stock ear pads but instead with the XL Memory Pads.  They don't put a lot of pressure on your head and it feels nice to wear them.  I feel like I can wear them for hours.  For comfort I say it is GREAT!  About 8 out of 10!  The headband/headrest is great too!  Also the comfort of outside noise is nice.  The outside noise is somewhat blocked and reduced when wearing these as these have passive noise cancellation.  It significantly reduces higher sounds and keeping the other sounds down a bit.  When I wear these on a indoor crowded campus food court, it made the surrounding area full of talking people sound much more quiet to a comfortable level.Overall: I recommend getting this headset unless you want the M-100s which are truly for audiophiles.  Also the new V-moda headset is coming out.  The V-moda Crossfade Wireless headset is the new one coming out soon and it is said to sound on par or better than the M-100s!  Maybe it's already out and available, just not on the Amazon yet.Other notes: I bought these during Black Friday sale at Amazon at a nice price.  I did not use stock ear pads only XL ones which are sold separately.  I use Razer Surround Pro for 7.1 virtual surround on my PC for gaming.  For the gym I used this headset wireless by taking the cable off and putting a bluetooth adapter on it although there is a wireless version of this headset coming out soon but much more expensive.EXTRA notes to mention: It also comes in with extra cable and plugs and other goodies like extra shield plates(gunmetal color)!  It has a nice tough black suit spiderman like case and the box is nice too!  Plus 2 Year Warranty and Immortal Life 50% Program!SUMMARY: [Performance: 8.5; B&D Quality: 9; Comfort: 8] = MUST BUY!
I've been waiting a while for the price of the V-Moda Crossfade LP2 Vocal Limited Edition headphones to drop below the MSRP of $200 to get them. Last November they finally did to about $130 and I didn't hesitate to purchase these cans, and let me tell you, boy am I happy that I did.My original intent in buying this set of cans was to get into amateur Djing. I do own a couple other sets of cans, some Sony MDRXB950BT/B that I purchased on sale at Best Buy for almost the same price as these and that I use for listening at home and at my day job and some Monoprice cans that I got at Rakuten for under $40 a while back that I have as backups.Style:My enjoyment with the LP2s  started just after seeing the styling box in which they come. Once I opened the box and saw the headphones my intuition was confirmed. These are some stylish cans, a plus if you want to DJ. They do take first place in that department followed by the Sony, and the Monoprice come in third.Quality/Durability:But style was not the first thing to come to my mind when I opened the box and held these cans in my hands. I couldn't help to think that I was holding a piece of military equipment. You will have to hold these things in your hands to experience the quality grade of these cans. Everything on the V-Modas scream quality from the metal frame to the kevlar removable cord(s). Although I've only had them for a few days, I don't need any more evidence to know that these are the most durable headphones I've ever seen. It's hard for me to tell which are more durable between the Sony and the Monoprice. They both seem reasonably durable. The Sonys have some metal parts while the Monoprice are made of thick heavy plastic. I would say it's a tie for second place.Comfort:The V-Modas are very comfortable. They have 50 mm drivers and my average to small ears seem to fit perfectly in them.  Even thou the Sonys are also listed as over-the ear headphones, they have only 40mm drivers and end up feeling more as on ear, thou the padding in the Sonys is very soft and make them feel the most comfortable of the three. The V-Modas take second place. I have read that buying the over-sized ear pads will add to the comfort of these cans. Maybe with the XL pads the V-Modas will take first place, but we'll see as they are not uncomfortable at all so I have not seen the need for this, maybe in the future. The Monoprice also have 50mm drivers and are truly over-the ear, but they are the less comfortable of the three as they seem to press on your ears and head after prolonged hours of wearing.Features:The V-Moda come with a nice carrying case, a couple of cords (one with a mic that i have not used yet), and although they are not listed as noise cancelling, because of the way they fit, they offer good sound isolation to your ears both in (noise cancellation) and out (sound leakage) and without the need for batteries! However, the Sonys take the first place as they are truly active noise canceling, have BT connection, and offer extra bass powered circuitry. The Monoprice take third place again as they do seem to come without any bells & whistles, although they offer some good noise cancelling properties because they are over-the ear as well and they do also come with removable cord.Sound:To my lay man's ears these three headphones sound great. But here is the shocker: I do feel that the Monoprice sound slightly better than the V-Modas and Sonys. The bass on the V-Modas and the Monoprice is equally good to my ears and better than the Sony's right of the bat (without the extra bass feature turned on.) The bass is not that overpowering that it will give you headaches like on Beats for example, and they seem to render a wide range of the sound spectrum in high fidelity, but the Monoprice seem to have slightly better clarity that make them stand from the pack. V-Modas come in second and Sony third (without the powered options.)Update: as other reviewers have mentioned the V-Modas are not very loud. This is not an issue for me since I know that hearing damage is irreversible and I don't like listening to music at very loud levels, but at low volume settings you can hear a clear difference in terms of volume output between the three brands. If you like to listen to loud music be prepared to buy some earphone amps.One thing that did disappoint me on the V-Modas is the lack of  better rotation on the ears pads in either axis. The ear pads do tilt about 60 degrees sideways, but that's it. Since I wanted these for DJing I would have liked that the ear pads rotated 180 degrees so you could hold the ear pad to one ear with one hand without the need to wear the headband to listed to your cue. Because of this I deducted one star.I do like and enjoy these cans and I would definitively recommend them if you can get them below MSRP. I would have not bought them at $200 since I already had another two sets of cans with similar features/ performance, but even at full retail price these might be worth it to you if you are looking for a complete set of cans: because of the style, comfort, sound quality and above all durability.
I cannot say enough good about these headphones! I produce music and DJ so I beat them up real bad and they just keep going. The last pair I bought lasted more the 5 years! They sound great and have a great balance of bass and clarity!
I am a headphone junkie. I use many pairs, styles and brands. For top audio or audiophile quality, these are not the ones. Get an open back, over ear wired set which costs 3-10X the price of these, but‚Ä¶.They do have their own purposes and strengths. If you don‚Äôt feel like busting out the $600-$2000 cans to relax for a pure audiophile listening session and just feel like cranking it up, saying F it and going back to teenage years of just cranking it to the max, these are them. The sound isn‚Äôt well balanced, no warmth or open sound stage. Instead you get clear vocal range highs mixed with clear but heavy slamming lows, not to much in the middle. Don‚Äôt get me wrong they do sound great for the price and as I‚Äôve said serve their purpose. I generally would always use my high end open back cans for most all listening, if only for the balanced sound quality and for precise listening through my stereo system. These V Moda‚Äôs I use when my sons crawls into my bed, lol, as they leak very little sound. As they are basically completely incased in steel and fit very snug, by snug I don‚Äôt mean as a negative. This also comes in handy when it is time to just plug into phone even and crank it up to the max, dancing, head banging, they won‚Äôt slip! Even use them as my guitar amp headphones so I can move and shake and they remain in place. My more expensive pairs are kept neat in their cases, while these are usually thrown around anywhere, lol. They are so incredibly durable, and even though the case is absolutely amazing it goes unused. I don‚Äôt use the cord with the controller phone buttons on it, thankfully comes with cord in same length with no other functions than letting sound pass through a straight line of copper, also the cord with buttons and a mic tends to pickup exterior noises.The custom aspects are cool to design different covers, but instead invest the extra $100 for that into just better headphones.I HIGHLY recommend separately purchasing the larger ear pad set. Makes them more comfortable and that good snug, I‚Äôve worn them for 14 hours straight before and had no discomfort, I‚Äôve cranked Soundgarden Live from the Artists Den while my 2 year old sleeps next to me, while the household is sleeping I‚Äôm able to plug into my amp and play my Telecaster with no interference.Honestly I love them. They are quality and do sound great especially in this price point, perform better in my opinion than Audio Technica‚Äôs or AKG‚Äôs in that price range.Just depends how you‚Äôd like to use them? If you want balanced sound, with clear highs, mids, and lows that offer a wide sound stage, these aren‚Äôt for you. If you sometimes just wanna scream and crank it up, these are the aggressive headphones you may want.I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend slowly breaking them in, as you should with majority of headphones, but for some reason I wanted a full throttle first test, plugged them into my headphone amp connected to my turntable, went all the up, and the drivers literally hit so hard the headphones were bulging from my ears, another reason the larger pads are a must. If you want LOUD, these will get you there.
The sound quality you get for $150 is almost outrageous and they're clearly built to last. I've owned these headphones for over 6 years and many thousands of hours of listening. I haven't exactly treated them gently (although I haven't abused them either) and the only repair I've ever had to do is  replace the ear cushions this month the first time as the originals were finally starting to peel.  $20  replacement cushions later and the headphones are good as new. I'd recommend these, even on new headphones,  as the cushions it comes with are way too small:https://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-XL-Cushions-Over-Ear-Headphones/dp/B00K3K8TKA10/10 product. I'd buy it again but I doubt  I'll ever need to.
First up, as you'll see a lot of people either confirming or denying with headphones of this price range, I'm not an audiophile. I do have a high standard of what I want and what I look for, but I can't accurately compare these to other headphones and be able to tell you the slight nuances between them. What I can tell you is that I was searching for a high quality, hassle free gaming headset to last me a long time. I've never been fully happy with any gaming headsets I've ever bought. You usually sacrifice quality in some regard for the moniker of "gaming headset." I thought I had found the perfect solution when I stumbled upon the HyperX Cloud II's, but a (now rectified) software issue that caused popping and an insufficient, quiet mic ultimately lead me to returning them. I really, really did not want to return the Clouds. You will have a hard time finding anything anywhere near as comfortable or a gaming headset that sounds anywhere near that nice at the price-range Kingston asks for. After I decided I couldn't settle with the Clouds, I eventually found a product known as the V-Moda Boompro Mic. After hearing a mic quality test, I knew I wanted it. So then began my search for a nice pair of cans with a detachable audio cable, and of course V-MODA's own products were the first in line. After searching around a bit I decided on the LP2's for the supposed bass response and lesser price tag than the M-100's, which I also heavily considered. Once they finally arrived and I plugged them in, I was not initially impressed with the sound. It did not quite feel like what I was paying for, but then with a little EQ work these things really worked for my ears The sound now is almost perfect for me. I would have easily given these 5 stars if not for one issue: comfort.The V-MODA LP2's come with incredibly small ear pads by default, despite being marketed as Over the Ear, they are most certainly not for any regular sized adult human. You'll find that nearly everyone who owns any V-MODA cans recommend buying the XL Ear Pads, and you certainly should. They -definitely- improve comfort by a large margin, and even the sound stage to some degree. However, even with the XL pads, my left ear still feels cramped and hits the inner wall of the cans. I have to readjust the cushioning in the XL pads more often than I would like to get a comfortable fit. Since I am using these for long gaming sessions, the problem is even more of an issue to me. I honestly wish V-MODA made XXL pads or something of that nature. I may end up returning these if I can find another set of cans that seem like they would be a great fit for what I want, but I am reluctant to give up the sound that I have tweaked to my preference. If these had a higher comfort factor, they would be nearly flawless.PROS:- Great presentation with the packaging. I was reluctant to cut the fabric that holds the lid shut. I was a bit baffled why they would include such a disposable piece of cloth that you are intended to ruin, but I guess it's for that "premium" feel, or something.- Comes with a very high quality semi-hard case. It fits very tightly with almost no room for bouncing around inside. I do not think I could even manage to fit my V-MODA Boompro Mic inside, and it's just an audio cable and a small, flexible mic wire.- Construction is beyond solid. All metal, no creaking. You do not have to handle these like they fragile, because they certainly are not. You shouldn't abuse them just for the fun of it, but they would probably take it.- Style wins out on these, and the custom shield plates is an alluring factor, even if I don't plan on wearing them in public.CONS:- Comfort seems to be hit or miss with people. Even with what I would consider small ears, they still feel somewhat cramped inside. Clamping pressure is strong out of the box, but with a little (gentle) bending and overnight placing on the product box to help stretch them out, this effect has been mostly calmed. I also wish they would have added a tiny bit more padding to the headband.-Sound was not good for me out of the box. With a decent amount of EQ tweaking, I think I have found a good balance that brings out punchy, strong bass, but reduces how muddy it first sounded to me.Overall, if you're considering the LP2's and can't afford to go to the M-100's, you will most likely be beyond satisfied. If you are planning on using these for gaming, make sure you buy from somewhere with a good return policy, as the comfort factor may be a deal breaker for you.UPDATE August 2017: My only flaw with these headphones, the comfort, became a non-issue after extended use. They continued to slightly shift to fit my head and I no longer get cramping on my left ear when wearing these. Occasionally the headband does fatigue the top of my head, but it is an uncommon occurrence and it can be fixed by slightly pushing the band forward or back on my head. Overall I definitely do recommend these headphones. They've held up great!
So, it's been a year-long road with me and this pair of cans, wearing them for hours at a time nearly daily, bending them over my large and (potentially) mishapen haead, and only until now has there been any major failure of the headphones. I've opwned headsets from Turtle Beach, Logitech, and several other manufacturers, and they tend to have only lasted me a few months Vs. the years I got out of my Vmoda Crossfade LP2's.it's not like they really had to sacrifice audio quality to get the steelflex headband and kevlar in there; audio range is wonderful and the noise canceling was enough for me to get in naps while my very noisy father was in the next room! I'm also very impressed with the two included 2.5mm headphone jack cables and the adapter. I've ahd shorting of all sorts in those before, but the braided Cables of Vmoda's endured.one thing to note is the cups it comes with; they are a small and sparing on the foam, and your ears are probably gonna get sore pretty quick unless you buy some bigger, more plush cups... and even then, I would be pretty sore by the end of particularly long sessions.In short, while these things aren't totally indestructable, if you find yourself with a wake of broken headphones behind you, you're gonna get some milage out of V-Moda's offering here.
First week:5 stars. Was searching for a pair of headphones that would satisfy my desire for a massively bassy experience. I own other more detail-oriented headphones (HD650) and the MDRZ7s that are also quite bassy (though not quite as intense, which is good for it's own, specific purpose) along with some Beyerdynamics and Shure IEMs. Each set serves it's own purpose for me and the V-Moda's fit in now just perfectly for the more bass-intensive genres I listen to like vaporwave, trap, etc.A couple notes:- Durability: Compared to other headphones I have, they don't seem to be that "sturdy". We will see how durable they are with time and I will definitely update this with more details eventually. This is just based on feel and interacting with them for the past few days. I will say, I already dropped them on hardwood floors once and they are just fine, so I suppose they deserve some durability points for that.- Comfort: I suspect many people will not like the way these headphones fit. With my tiny ears, everything fits just fine. But those with larger ears, I think would benefit from trying them in person first if comfort is a deal-breaker. Others have pointed out the padding isn't that thick. Based on my experience, the padding is fine for me in terms of softness, but yes if I push in on the headphone can a little,  I am able to feel my ear on the back of the headphone. One other thing I will note is that the clamp is quite a bit stronger than my other sets like the Amiron and the MDRZ7s. The clamp on these, for me, is more comparable to the HD650s which I had to get used to. For reference, I usually enjoy a nice, loose fit. These are not loose at all and I think my head is on the more average to small side of the spectrum.- Sound: If you're wanting a set that is for analytical listening, obviously look elsewhere. For me these are great for relaxed, mood producing listening. I've been heavy with the vaporwave for the past few days because these just envelop you in the hazy, retro, bassy, atmosphere of that genre.I will continue to update this review with time.11/17/18 Short Update:Changed to 4 stars since comfort has proven to be a consistent issue. I will likely be purchasing new ear pads soon. Durability has been fantastic, though. I keep dropping this pair of headphones for whatever reason (it‚Äôs been at least 4 times now lol) and not a scratch or technical problem whatsoever. Sound is good, but was in a situation where I had to use these while working in my DAW recently and noticed just how inaccurate they are especially on the low end. I don‚Äôt intend on using these as studio headphones when it can be avoided, but it‚Äôs worth reiterating that these headphones are not for those looking for a flat experience.12/16/2018 update:3 starsSurprising turn of events, I'm not a *huge* fan of these anymore (or at least at the moment). First and most noticeable: comfort is just horrendous and I won't dwell on that again since I've said it above. But notably I have been out of town the majority of the time I have owned/used these and recently returned home where my headphone collection is. I started using some of my others again and the sound after using my MDRZ7s, for instance, is just not the best, at least for certain kinds of music and sounds. It seems hidden or like there's a veil or it's a little distant both when I'm listening to super-bassy music and non-bassy music. I definitely won't be using these anymore for anything that doesn't contain massive amounts of bass. If I want that "vibrating the entire intersection while waiting at the traffic light" kind of bass, yeah sure, I will use them to get to try to get that messy, vibrating deep bass in headphone form, otherwise not so much.Another development: discoloration has started ocurring in the headphone itself where my ear sits. I've never had this happen with a pair of headphones, which to me suggests my ear is always resting right on top of the fabric inside. I said earlier this didn't bother me because I didn't feel it really, but this has changed over time with more use. I feel my ear on the inside all the time now that I'm aware of it, which also doesn't help with comfort.Hope this helps someone, probably my last update.

I wear these while mowing.  I listen to streaming music and can answer my phone if needed with the mower running.  Low price good value.  Quick to charge and easy to pair with my phone.  I have trouble with the volume controls but only because they are new to me.
My husband is very satisfied. I am pleased with price.
These headphones are great for watching movies, listening to music, completing online training classes or anywhere else you are not required to talk. However, the deep bass they mention is lacking. Unfortunately using these headphones during a phone call, Zoom call, WebEx, etc. are lacking as microphone quality is lacking and impacts the ability for the remote side to hear you. On two occasions, during a zoom conference, I asked if everyone could hear me and was told by multiple individuals that it sounded really muffled and hard to hear.If you just want these to just listen, then by all mean purchase as they are great for that but if you plan on using during conference calls, online classes, etc. where you must speak find something better.
The headset is well design. However, everytime I connect to pc or Iphone the music doesn‚Äôt play right. Is like always you were ‚Äúaway‚Äù from the device despite is really close. The noise cancelling is good.
I did not like that this item was NOT NEW. It infact was REFURBISHED, or RETURNED. Not only was there clear signs of them being handled prior to me receiving them but the item box had two stickers on it. One says renewed and the other said new. see pictures. Also see all the finger prints.
About two years ago, my grandmother got the red headphones for Christmas and gave it to me. The noise cancelation was nice but it was short lived, sound quality it top notch, and the buttons are always working nice and well, these headphones worked well till about a couple of months ago the right side of the headphone didn‚Äôt work (just sound, the switch works fine to turn it on). Gotta say if there‚Äôs anything I wanna say I would give this a 9.5/10For good quality
I like these so I ordered a second set for my husband.
excellent product , arrived super fast .  High quality !  my husband loved the gift.  thank you ru really recommend
The volume control was not easy to use. The sound quality was not good.I returned these headphones üéß
I really like them. Wish they had the bass then claimed to have and a higher volume. But very nice.

Ear pads peel quickly
These are lightweight and dependable. My only problem I ran into is that the ear padding became extremely wet after a good run (gym workouts too) and are still wet the next day. The padding retains too much water. Also, the volume could go a little louder. I would definitely recommend.
Love these headphones. I ordered them instead of another popular brand was said to be very uncomfortable and I wanted something with lots of bass as I listen to hip-hop/rap exclusively.Comfort-Very comfortable, they made my ears hot at first but they don‚Äôt anymore. I‚Äôve been wearing them 5-6 hours a day with no problem.Sound-I‚Äôm not a audiophile so I can‚Äôt be very technical about mids and treble and stuff but I can say they sound great and have PLENTY of bass, it can be adjusted to have even more bass. Great for rap songs.Battery Life-Haven‚Äôt tested these too much yet. They arrived 70% charged and I used them all day and they only went down to 50%. Charged them for about 1.5 hours and they were at 100%. Will update later after testing fully.Durability-Can‚Äôt speak on this yet as I‚Äôve only had them a few days but if they‚Äôre anything like my cheaper Sony headphones they should last a long time.  I will update in a few months.Wireless Range-Another thing I haven‚Äôt tested fully but I can leave my tablet on the couch and go out on the porch or to my room which is 35-40 feet. No quality drop or interruptions.Noise Cancellation-These are not ANC headphones but they do block out most sound like people talking or watching TV in the same room.Overall I love these headphones so far. Super glad I chose them over the $130 competitors.Also you can tap the power button once when on and it will tell you the battery percent.
These headphone are great for music. You can hear everything clearly and nicely. Would recommend for the price
I really love these headphones. i had low expectations when i ordered them until i tried them out. the sound quality is better than i thought. The extra bass is a pro as well. I also bought these because they aren't noise cancellation headphones. I do a-lot of city walking and want to hear cars, people, etc., that might be around me. I saw the reviews of the ear cushion ripping. I bought a headphone case that i can put them in when not in use so that problem doesn't happen to me. Battery life is also a pro as i only charge these once a week and they don't go any lower than 50% within a week until i charge them again.Cons: If you wear these for too long your ears start to get sore. That's the only problem i have had with these so far.
These headphones provides good quality sound.  I''m very happy with the bass response.This headset has a very odd way of measuring battery life.Note, the black plastic coating the full  ear pads fabric shreds and comes off in pieces leaving the white fabric underneath behind.Also, one must be careful not to torque the headband during normal wear  as it can be relatively easily  displaced where the headband joins the earmuff and one must then *carefully* force the joint back into position.Additionally, one or both of the headband "expansion joints" can become completely dislodged from their tracks and become stuck beyond the fully extended position and wouldn't go back.  When it did this, the headband eventually became completely separated at the stuck joint and I was able to *gently* put it back into the proper position  without breaking the wires hidden within.  This happened when I fell asleep wearing the headphonesI would not buy this product again.
I got these renewed for $49.99 and they sound incredible. My old MDR-X950N1 hinges broke on the right side  since I had those for about three years and these even without Noise Cancellation they sound good and loud. They did pair up with my Pixel 4A perfectly and I did got the Sony Music App for the updates which the older headphones has no updates but at least those went around my ears but these are very light which is perfect since the older ones felt like a pound on top of my head. My only problem there is no lights to tell if they are on, only when they get paired and that's it. I do like it that the custom button is for my Google Assistant to read me my notifications. This is a lot for a budget bluetooth headphones and like I said the sound is perfect in the mid the highs and not that heavy on the bass but its perfect for music. Its worth it by far
Previously purchased the 650BT model and this upgrade is a step better from the previous model.Sound Quality has improved and the BASS is definitely there. If you get sick from too much bass after hours of listening, you could adjust it in the app.Most important is this headphones is PERFECT for the gym. The pressure from the clamp doesn't crush your head and it doesn't easily slip off unlike the 650 model once you get sweaty.Good job Sony!!!
I listen to music while working
I paid $44 dollars for mine, cause of ‚Äúdamaged packaging‚ÄùI dunno what crack this particular NJ Amazon Warehouse was smoking but I got a brand new pair in an unopened box.That said, the build is a little cheaper than expected for the actual price tag. They feel solid enough but the plastic still doesn‚Äôt heel premium at all.The mini cable is one of the nicer, better built ones I‚Äôve seen in box.Bluetooth set up is easy, but I wouldn‚Äôt bother with the app unless you wanna use Alexa or adjust the bass level.They sound pretty good but I was actually disappointed by the bass of all things.The whole dynamic range falls just short of amazing and lands in very enjoyable.They‚Äôre also much larger than I expected and aren‚Äôt quite as stealthy as I‚Äôd have liked.I definitely wouldn‚Äôt pay full retail but if you can find em for 65 or less Id say jump on it.

Judging by the majority of audiophile reviews of these on YouTube, these are well tuned, reasonably "detailed" with very average for the price "technicalities", mediocre build pair of headphones.I disagree. First, materials are awesome - great plastics, great headband, very hygienic, 7/10 comfortable.Pads are almost great - they lack like maybe a couple of millimeters of depth for my ears, though they're sewed smartly, and plush, and easy to clean.The adjustment and folding mechanism looks junky on videos, while in the real life it's sturdy, clicks are very precise, controllable, the joint seems sturdy.And these are very, very compact when folded - I carry them in my fanny pack, this is ridiculously convenient for a full size headphones.Cables suck, all three of them, they're like kings of microphonic effect, you need a replacement. Btw, choose Hart Audio cables, they're awesome.If it's hot, you need an AC in the room, since in 2-3 hours K371 will become hot and sweaty. Plus, since they slightly touch my pinna, I can wear them like 4 hours tops.And no amp is needed, you can drive them out your finger probably.Sound isolation is mediocre - I found it worse compared to Elegia and DT770.Ok, now sound.Out of the box AKG K371 sucks. Like a lot. It's like really bad. It's dry. It's low bass. It's shouty. It doesn't make any sense at all.But give them time. I don't know if that's pads burn-in, your brain's burn-in or driver burn-in and it doesn't matter actually. The fact it - that you need to run them on your head for quite a while to get to the point when they start to sound good.And OMG they change. I do have DCA AEON Open Flow RT, DT770 250Om and Focal Elegia, plus I have experience with many other cans and iems in very different pricing brackets.AKG K371 shocked me. I couldn't believe my ears.They're very balanced overall, mids are tight, natural, vocals are distinct, natural and well placed - not too far, not too "intimate".Brass instruments and electric guitars got some very pleasant bite.Bass is just how I like it - it's neutral. And yes, there is a very, very notable rise in sub-bass, but that's really much closer to how speakers sound in real life.Highs do not attract much of my attention, they're balanced. You can hear hits on hi-hats, you can hear a pretty ok decay on cymbals, there is nothing bothering me at any volume level (I'm looking at you, almost every other headphone I've heard).They're reasonably wide, way outside your head and there is a perceived soundstage depth, not to Elegia's level, but K371 is not flat at all in this department. Just place them kind of slightly forward on your ear and you're fine.Regarding the detail - I don't know, really. I don't feel that my planars or Elegia, both EQed to Harman and non EQed, are like more or less "detailed". I'd say I stopped listening my DCA AFO RT, that's for sure and I LOVED that headphone. Now AKG spoiled them for me and just can't.Elegia is still a thing of it's own and makes a lot of sense compared to AKG still. Elegia is the punchiest headphone I heard ever, it's textured and "physical" and no one else is close (I never auditioned 900MK2 or first gen HE-6). K371 is not flat, they're also reasonably textured, and that bite on brass is not available on Elegia, not to speak of light weight and portability of AKG. And the price.AKG K371 is better that Beyerdynamic DT770 250OM in almost every aspect. DT770 still got a ton of spare parts, a bigger comfy earcup and the stock cable is significantly better.I apply Oratory 1990 EQ to K371, but only up from 1KHz, changes are minor, but improvement is noticeable.With no EQ they actually do not sound "close" and with Oratory's EQ up from 1KHz they disappear slightly more. I know, right? No one was telling me that in any review.To sum it up. AKG K371 broke my 15+ years of audiophile experience. I'm puzzled, pleasantly surprised and don't know what to think.It looks as neutral FR is almost everything, with some place for speculation in punchiness and soundstage topics.I don't know. Like, buy these, try them out, give them time, be open minded, don't listen to overs, don't look at the price, be ready to change your opinion and accept that your previous experiences, opinions and spending stopped making any sense.I had a dream, that a perfect sound will become available to anyone sometime far in the future, but apparently that future is now.
After doing some internet research I found the K371 to be the right headphone for me, but curiosity got the best of me when I was researching replacement pads for it. Some reviewers claimed that the pads were different between the BT and none BT models, however Dekoni claims the same pad works for both devices as well as the K361. Turns out the pads are exactly the same, though the felt experience is a bit different on the BT models because of the thicker ear cups.Other differences to note:(1) Sound - if you weren't doing a side by side you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between how the two sound, however the K371 seems slightly more rich in classical and folk music and the bass is cleaner to my ears. It also sounded like there was a click or very brief rattle in the BT model when heavy base hit, such as in Vaishiyas song "Arped". This may have been a defect, or it may be the BT module adding to the dynamic sound environment in an unpleasant way. Additionally, I had a weird channel separation sensation in my ears with the BT model that went away after a few hours of play time.(2) Cable/Connectors - The K371-BT uses a 4-pin XLR connector for the cable whereas the K371 uses a more common 3-pin XLR. The 4-pin cable having more conductors in the wire is also more stiff and unpleasant, as you may be able to see in the picture. FYI - the K361 uses a smaller aux connector, probably a 2.5mm, which actually makes more sense for the BT model since the 2.5mm female end takes up less space than a 4-pin XLR.(3) Usability - The BT model is really convenient, and I must say I feel hesitant to return it, however I think I would take the cost savings on the K361 and the convivence of the smaller cable connector. If you're shopping for the wireless option between the K371 and K361, go for the K361 or save for a higher end BT headphone. For the wired, I must say I am enjoying the K371 and see no need to try the K361, which is a bit cheaper. Other notes on BT--the range is great and I can walk 50ft to the breakroom or bathroom from my desk at work and still have good connection. The touch controls are fine, not perfect, but I found them better than not having any. Sometimes it seemed like the BT connection would randomly degrade after listening for over an hour or so and when connected to Windows 10, but I didn't have that issue on Android.
The headphone is, of course, nearly ideal to the Harmon Curve... and does seem to be fairly balanced sound profile/tonality bass to treble. There does seem to be some elevation of response around 20 Hz from flat, but I wouldn't say they are really heavy bass.  Honestly given the price, sounds great.  After 3 weeks of wear, found them very comfortable for prolonged wear for me, with one minor gripe:  The headphone cable comes out of the left ear and points directly down. If I am sitting up and doing something else, I have no problem with it, but if I am relaxed and slouched back in my chair just enjoying, I find the strain relief of the the cable pushing against my shoulder.  But all-in-all good.
Where do I even start with the AKG K371. When you listen to these, it's like everything disappears, leaving nothing between you and the music. It's arguably the best closed back headphone that you can easily drive with mobile devices, like cell phones. The only closed-backs (headphones that don't leak sound everywhere) that are a significant improvement start at around 900 dollars, and you can only get the most out of them with a bulky amp, which cost a few hundred. For most people, this is as good as you'll ever need. And once you consider the price of around 150 dollars, it's arguably the best overall.Now the sound. Oh lord the sound. These are quite frankly, beyond words to describe. If you're going from crappy earbuds or even mid tier headphones like the ATH-M50, it feels like listening to your songs for the first time all over again. It feels like there's nothing between you and the music. As for the actual sound signature, it's one of the best tuned headphones period. The slight bump in the sub-bass adds a subtle but fun kick. The bass is impressively detailed and controlled. The mids are well balanced without being reduced into the shadow realm. And finally, the treble is detailed and fun but without being too bright. Overall, it's very detailed and the tuning is to die for. Soundstage is rather impressive, and although it's not quite the best in that regard, it's nonetheless great. Noise isolation is okay, not great but "good enough". Imaging (left-right differentiation) is very solid.These headphones excel at pretty much whatever you throw at them. I listened to a mix of Pop, Hip-hop, classic rock, metal, classical, electronic, jazz, synth, you name it. It's not just a jack of all trades, it masters then all. Gaming with these is also pleasant. I played Minecraft and Team Fortress 2 with these, and you have a pretty easy time discerning the direction of in-game sounds.Finally we get to the overall physical build of the headphones. This is where the only real flaws show up. Some people online reported QC issues, but they seem to be resolved at this point, and indeed my pair is fine. The top of the headband has some soft plastic imitating leather. This is actually a good thing, since it feels like it probably won't start flaking off in a few years. The inside of the headband is some sort of padded silicone material, which should make it real easy to clean. The headband adjustment mechanism is odd. It combines the function of adjusting the headband and letting the earcups rotate inward for storage. It's a little more loose that I'd like, making it hard to get an exact position while holding it, but it holds in place flawlessly once on your head. Fortunately, there's an easily accessible screw once you remove a soft pad on the inside of the pivot, so tightening the whole thing is no problem. the bottom part of this mechanism is made of metal. The earcups are hit and miss. They're comfy leather, but can have trouble sealing, especially with glasses. Furthermore, AKG does not seem to offer replacements on their website. I've found that Shure SRH1540 earpads function as a suitable replacement, albeit an expensive one. But I could not perceive any difference in sound between different earpads, other than an improved seal using the Shure earpads. The included accessories are nice, including the drawstring carrying bag. The cable is slightly microphonic (noise gets transmitted through the cable when you touch it), but you don't notice it at all with music. The cables themselves though (you get three, none with mic, just a 1m, 3m, and coiled cable, with a screw-on 3.5mm to 1/4in adapter. Having detachable cables is a very nice touch.So despite all the minor issues with the build, you might wonder why I'm still rating it 5 stars. Well, it's because they just sound that good. I couldn't recommend these enough. And for 150 dollars, it's a no-brainer.
NOTE: I have since switched to the AKG K371 (non-BT variant) and they resolve nearly every issue I had with these.These are an interesting set of cans. I'm just going to go straight into this analysis:- These headphones have a surface material that scratches VERY easily- they have an annoying mini XLR cable gratefully detachable, but it's 4 pinned, and very obscure to replace unlike the standard 3 pin mini xlr cable with the standard non BT K371. Additionally the cable itself is legitimately *very difficult to release via the button, and i have big guitar playing hands.- The hinge system is down right ridiculously stupid. It's designed to be "portable" (but this is marketed as a professional grade studio headphone so why??), and because of that they've redesigned a way to attach the ear cups to the headband, and unfortunately it creates a bunch of issues inherent to the entire new K-line by AKG (361, 371, and both BT variants). What are those issues?1. Well, there's a bunch of sound leak, because it applies excessive pressure on the top part of the cup and leaks on the bottom as a result.2. The physical cups are on an adjustment bar that is very sensitive to readjustments and often doesn't ever stay in place properly. It's so stupid how bad this works because remember, theres a big sound leak issue which SUBsequently leaks all of the low frequencies. So the only solution alternatively is a pad switch, or to adjust the headphones in a way where the ear cups and headband angle can *kind* of compensate for this. BUT THAT DOESN'T WORK SO GREAT WHEN THE CUPS READJUST THEMSELVES BY BREATHING ON THEM. Let's not even get into how dysfunctional it is without this sound leak issue. Trying to reinvent the wheel in total failure.3. The way the pressure is applied on the cup, it presses excessive force above the top of the ear, which happens to be where a small pressure point on the head is. So the result is a headphone clamp that causes mild headaches upon use. I believe as you use these, this clamp force is reduced as mentioned on headfi.org, but then I would imagine this effects the seal from the cups themselves, thus resulting in more sound leak.So these ups are just one big negative feedback.To add insult to injury, AKG designed the ear cups differently between k371 and the k371bt. The k371's are recessed differently, and as a result, the newer BT variant I'm reviewing are very, very close to the ears due to different and thinner pads. As a matter of fact, for me, with a regular shaped head and sized ears, MY EARS REST AGAINST THE DRIVER of the headphones. This is so unacceptable at this price point and for a "Professional Studio Headphone". I can't mix for more than an hour without severe ache and irritation from my ears because of this. They agitate unrelentingly, and this is the main reason I've decided to return them.The sound is okay.I myself enjoy the roundness of the low end, albeit a little bloated.The Bluetooth:-Can only connect to one device at a time.-limited Codec options make for commercial grade sound, but below average for audiophiles or "Professional Studio" use. I'm assuming this feature isn't intended for professional usecases.- The range I apparently VERY good! Which is a great surprise. There supposedly supposed to be about as good as Apple Air Pods, and better than just about every thing else tried by another user I've spoken with.- Controls are comically bad. They're touch, and I‚Äôd say anywhere between 15% and 20% of the time I can get it to work (.e. play, pause, etc). Volume control is as bad, if not worse for me. Closer to 10% of the time I'd say, without exaggeration.Finally, to touch on pad swap. I swapped to the perforated ‚Äúslanted‚Äù pad made by BRAINWAVZ and while I didn‚Äôt mind the original sound signature in it‚Äôs lows, this pad swap has created a much more balanced sound in the lows, while also making the signature much more interesting in the upper mids and treble. They add a little bit of pleasing air, scoop out some of the excessive fattiness in the sup bass, making it more shapely overall, while also, and to my great appreciation, reduce some of the abrasive mids that can come off ‚Äúshouty‚Äù in the original pad response. Finally, something that is definitely worth noting and praising that you did not mention, is that the perforated pads create a SIGNIFICANT breathe-ability in the ear cup with the cans on which is not only adding to the ‚Äúairiness‚Äù on top, in the treble register, but also helping tremendously with long recording sessions. Before, the stock pads would not only kill the ears with achiness and irritability, they would get VERY sweaty and hot in reasonable 1.5+ hour recording sessions. These new BRAINWAVZ perforated pads for the ATX line are substantially more breathable, which would seem obvious, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be this much better. Humidity never really exceeds 60% of what the original pads did after an hour and a half. And that is a huge difference. Also, on the subject of these pads and the ‚Äúon-ear‚Äù fit. They do fit kinda half on ear half off, because there is an inward slant that goes towards the inside of the cup. Now, I myself am sensitive to this idea, but for some reason it doesn‚Äôt feel noticeable uncomfortable or agitating. I don‚Äôt really know why that is but I‚Äôm very grateful.Conclusion:I like the sound, the fact that the cable is detachable, and the Bluetooth sound is actually pretty darn good compared to others. But, too many other issues. Sure, with the extra pads, 3, or even 3.5 would be reasonable IMHO. But with the number of fundamental issues like the stupid hinge design (Why are they adding ‚Äúportability‚Äù design to a studio headphone FFS?), and thus, awful sound leak, as well as very poor Bluetooth controls, the strange clamp force headache, and very poor ear cup design... These design flaws are so fundamental, that they‚Äôre inexcusable to me as a consumer And bear in mind my body dimensions are very average. Perhaps on the slimmer athletic side with normal head size and ear size. Not to sound harsh, but the issues are so  basic that they deserve to be highly criticized IMO.My final score would be 2-2.5 stars.
I bought the k361-bt versions, and I will stand by these headphones having an incredibly good sound. While they don't come with ANC and have a proprietary cable, the benefits of the sound alone are worth the money.Unfortunately, after about 2 months of use, the right ear cup suddenly gave out. I have been very careful with these headphones and generally place them gently because of the way it folds. But just today, as I decided to plug them into my laptop just for general use, no sound was coming out of the right ear. I'm afraid I believe it might be one of the wires being loose, as even in wireless mode it still has no sound coming out of the right cup.I still stand by it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a mid range priced pair of cans. Unfortunately I won't be able to appreciate them for a while now. I am absolutely devastated because these have beeny favorite pairs to go to for the past couple months.
Top quality sound but very little isolation.
I was never a fan of headphones until I bought this one. Because I needed to meditate using binaural beat audio files, I bought another so called "professional" headphone 3 years ago for $50. Although its bass is good enough for the low frequency in my audio files, I was never satisfied with its other respects of the sound quality. Then my old headphone broke so I needed to buy a replacement. I made the decision to buy AKG 371 based on its range of frequency response and its price.I never used any other headphones with sound quality better than audiophile class speakers until this one. I have a stereo speaker/amplifier system worth $600. Now if I make the speaker volume low, I should say the sound quality from my 371 headphone is better than sound from my speaker system. The speaker sound quality is better than the sound from 371 headphone only if I make the speaker system volume loud.The sound from the headphone is clear and rich, with all the frequency components from music. The bass is rich but not heavy and the treble is full of clarity. I am very satisfied with this headphone! Although the build quality for this headphone is not the top class, I cannot expect much for a headphone at a price lower than $200.Something to note for beginner audiophile listeners:1. You need a good quality DAC (digital analog converter) to fully realize the headphone's potential. Both my computer and my cellphone have HD DACs so they are good enough for me. You don't need to buy this headphone if you only have a very low end cellphone.2. Also you need at least high data rate MP3 files to really enjoy the rich details of the music. Probably you need at least 192kbps MP3 files. You don't need this headphone for 128kbps MP3 files.
Very comfortable for long listening sessions. Tuned to Harman frequency response curve. Great for most genres. Details, soundstage, and build quality are good for the price.
I got these in June 2021. Was surprised that they sounded so bright given that they have a reputation for being dark sounding but I didn't mind. I listen to mostly metal and rock, stuff with instruments and these were fantastic. Unfortunately the pads fell apart in about 8 months. I replaced them with Shure HPAEC1540 pads (a bit pricey but worth it. They don't change the sound much and are more comfy than stock pads). I was happy with this setup until the right side driver just up and died on me at the end of July 2022. I used them heavily (6 hours daily on average) but am very careful and took care of them as best as I could. I didn't get any shorting or anything before it happened. Just unplugged for the night, tried in the morning and nothing. Even opened it up to check for issues with the cabling and everything seemed normal. The driver was dead. I was very disappointed. Loved these things up to that point. So yea, great sound but they may die on you.I've since replaced them with Beyerdynamic DT 700 Pros and am happy again as the sound signature is similar but with improvements in the bass regions. The build quality on these and Beyer's reputation also inspire confidence in their durability.

They are very cool headphones! Love the color and the Noise cancellation works amazing! Def the coolest I‚Äôve ever had.
About 7 hours of use in, and my opinions are the following :> They connect & reconnect (after being upaired to one device) FAST> If you like to wear items that get public attention in general or stand out, the neon green does that. How often to you see people wearing neon green headphones ?> The earpiece foam is the very generic foam that you would have found in headphones prior to the widespread use of memory foam/memory foam hybrids. If you can picture what I'll call "80's foam", thats what is in these headphones. Which means limited comfort and a much more limited foam lifespan.Because of the type of foam used, you'll also develop wear fatigue from the headphones sooner. I find myself moving them around every few hours because there 1) isn't enough foam and 2) the type of foam isn't really supportive of very long (ex: 5 hours) use sessions> The earpiece cups are just touching on being undersized without being undersized. So if you have larger ears and find on-ear headphones (these arent on ear, but for people with larger ears they will be in part) painful, these probably will not work for you.> Sound quality is fine, thus far its roughly comparable to my Skullcandy Crushers. Make sure you install the mobile app and tune the headphones to your sound preferences/needs.> The noise cancellation on these headphones is very reasonable. Not stellar, not terrible -- but reasonable.> Battery life : I'm about 7 hours in on the charge that they came with out of the box, and thus far the battery life like the noise cancellation is reasonable.Present conclusion : These are an "okay" set of headphones, but, if I were on a budget of around $100 usd for one set of over-ear bluetooth headphones, these would not be my choice.Flatly, you can get better over-all for the money.The one feature that I do really enjoy, is the aggressiveness with which these headphones want to pair with a device.
Just bought this item yesterday and can't believe I have to write this review so soon.NB: using exclusively on my PC and have not had a chance to use the mic (but the mic being good or not would not affect my overall opinion)Starting with the pros:-Really good noise cancellation-Looks really good-Fits comfortably in my ears-Battery life is pretty nice, can't say too much (charged for 2-3hrs, been using for almost 12hrs now, hasnt died or showed low battery yet)Now for the cons:- Not sure why, but does not connect automatically. Windows keeps saying that it failed to connect. So every time I turn it off and on, I have to remove it from my list of paired devices and re-add it for it to connect.- Auto turns off after 5mns of no noise. (Can bypass by downloading the app on your phone or tablet and changing the setting to never, but nowhere says that so had to google.)-Really choppy sounds randomly. Audio would play and out of nowhere it's like it stuttered for half a second and happens often enough that it gets annoying.-Does not pick up dialogue very well when there is background music. Watched a few movies and shows and the background music is almost always louder than the voice.-Sound quality feels degraded. You get used to it after a while, but audio does sound worse with these on.-Lastly, this is personal, but there is no real way of checking your battery level apart from when you first turn it on and/or using the app. (using this for my pc so I can't use the app)Overall,  I hope that maybe it's just my headset that is defective but for the price, I don't think I would recommend buying this.
it starts with pokemon go, and the need to listen for that team rocket balloon. two handed dog walks where i can seamlessly go between ios, windows, and mac os should be heaven but‚Ä¶ damn if i didnt reach to chamge the anc and find that thenplastic cracked like low grade lego knickoff and with it came ine ear cup, wire removed clean,y into the headband. now this could be a bad pair affter a mknth - or it could be that ive had this happen 4x and only ince was the damage me and a car wheel in the wrong place. i thinka refund is deserved considering my loyalty but hey, amazon doesnt do nice thjngs
First pair of wireless headphones and LOVIN' it. Until now, I've been using an Amazon headset which, actually, is pretty good for my needs (tuning out the world while exercising). BUT I was wire bound..which sucks when you are on a rowing machine or a climber!Razer pros:>>fits COMFORTABLY over my ears>>my favorite color>>can hear EVERYTHING while watching a movie on my 10" Fire TableCons:volume controls could be better placed.I'm not picky about sound so as far as I'm concerned...this sounds great!!
Was somewhat worried about the latency of Bluetooth headphones, but these came in just as good as wired ones. The microphone doesn't play well with linux, but since I already had a standalone mic that didn't really matter
Se acomodan bien, no presionan las orejas, desde que llegaron no los e cargado, excelente sonido excelente calidad, faltar√≠a un escuche ya que no se pueden guardar tan facil y se podr√≠an da√±ar. De resto 100% Recomendados ...
Setup and tested 3 ways - with Bluetooth transmitter for TV watching, connected thru a MacBook and directly with iPhone.Solid construction. Quickly connects to Bluetooth within 3 seconds. Audio is clear and not overpowering, could be louder. Controls are simple and easy to adjust.Used over 8 hours and still at 50%. Great feature - while connected watching TV, for power level, simply connected to Audio app and confirmed remaining power level and made changes to the EQ on the fly.Another great feature - auto power off. Saves battery life when nothing detected and quickly reconnects.Cons - Audio level could be higher, Ear muffs covers bad quality and already losing color. Awful placement of the microphones. Aimed to top and not near mouth area.
I think the music when being played sounds like someone messed with a couple of wires and made it sound worse than its supposed to. I wouldn't spend money on this if I was you.
To start off I only had a few hours with the headset.Unfortunately after extended use the left side of my headset stopped working and rather than running through hoops for headphones I decided where lack luster, I just returned them.For my fellow lovers of bass, thump, and punch in your music, these are not at all what you want. Abysmal across the board when it comes to those.If you're a fan of neutral sound then these would fit that category.But for some reason, all the music sounds muffled like someone is actively blocking the speakers.Now this could have been my pair considering they broke on me, but I feel like im not the only one who feels like these headphones are definitely lacking.Had these been within the $50-$60 range I could definitely recommend.Its sound I would expect from cheap headphones, not a $100 pair.The ANC did absolutely nothing,  literally I noticed no difference on or off, I still heard everything clearly.Razer didn't necessarily drop the ball, but they certainly priced it wrong.

I really like them. They are light and the sound are great. The only complaint that I have is if I listen my music really loud then people around me can listen to my music.
Comfy, nice build, but needs higher volume output for when you want to crank up the music
These headphones feels like an aviation or NASA headsets for people works on operating flights etc., these looks very huge on head and looks feels weird to use these in office location. I used it for few days in my office and most of them looked at me with weird expressions‚Ä¶ not sure on what reference Logitech designed these headphones for office but does not work for all hopefully.
Lightweight, comfortable‚Ä¶ can be worn for long periods of time. Excellent blue tooth pairing and ideal for those needing to use for phone and video meetings. Music and other sound do sound great. Very good headphones for the price.
Thanks
I purchased this product because they advertised excellent dual microphone noise canceling. I expected there to be a drop in quality from my wired Logitech Zone 750 but this is terrible. I've been told it sounds like I'm in a tin can and they can hear my typing, air purifier, dog barking, cars passing. I've played with all the settings. Testing on a Dell XPS 950 Windows 10, MacBook 2018, Lenovo T540, Dell Latitude and the results are the same. The speakers are crap too. Save your money and do not but this product.
I ordered these to have a ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù secondary headset for music/movies/video calls while I work. My other headset I primarily use for gaming. I can say these are a great replacement for my gaming headset.The bass is good, punchy and no rattle. The highs are also great. Build quality is also great. It‚Äôs mainly plastic, but the plastic feels high quality and durable. I think what impressed me was the lack of weight. They are super light, without feeling cheap. I can wear them for hours on end with no complaints.I think my only cons are I wished they got a bit louder and the mic isn‚Äôt terrible, but I prefer my AirPod Pros. The mic itself is a little too tinny for my liking.
SO I had a chance to review these new logitech zone vibe 100 headset, and I gotta say, I didn't look at the price until I started writing this review. My answer to $99 is no way. I was thinking in my head $40 to $45. While I found the bass to be fine, and the lows fine, the BT leaves this headset with a lot to be desired. First off this is by no means a gamer headset. BT is a horrible medium for gaming sound, and to Logitech's benefit, no where on the box itself does it say gaming anywhere(Just inside). They are being billed as a phone, calls headset. Well I guess that is fine, but in a packed world of fantastic ear buds would you want these over those? I do not see the niche. And the $99 for a headset billed at lasting just 18 hours talk/ 20 hours listen. While I would say on a positive they are very light, The ear muffs just aren't that comfortable over ,more than 30 minutes. They don't breathe well so your ears get hot. They used 40mm drivers which surprisingly didn't do as bad as almost any other 40mm I have tried, it is still noticeable. I would take my $99 and get a nice pair of ear buds.
As expected from Logitech, this headset is well made and looks snazzy. The scope of delivery included a bag and charging cable (USB-C) as well as a quick start guide. Its light weight and fits perfect, at least on my head. Very comfortable even when worn for hours. Connecting via Bluetooth to a PC was very quick and easy. No additional drivers required. All the features you need for conference calling or listening to music are there and can be controlled via small buttons on the headset. A soft female voice gives feedback on the functions. The microphone on the side is foldable and is automatically muted when flipped up or vice versa when flipped down. The sound quality for conference calls is very good, as is the MICROPHONE noise cancellation. The sound quality for listening to music is well balanced, only the bass is a bit too rich, but most younger people like that. It's not a high-end headset for music enthusiasts, but it's a great all-rounder in my opinion. All in all it is a great device and I can only recommend it.
It was working perfectly fine on Zoom and quite comfortable, but when I switched to MS Teams, people could barely hear me.  I hadn't changed a thing in settings.  Going back I think.

I like everything about them. It only took a minute to figure out how to use them. The volume level is good. The sound is good. The noise cancellation was able to block out my lawn mower. I couldn't even hear my ear buds over the lawn mower. With these, I can hear without blasting out my ear drums.

Very good for the price. My 3 year old wanted Peppa Pig headphones and these looked adorable.  But they are much too big for her even on the smallest setting.She likes them, but had to hold them on her head üòêThey are also very quiet and not great sound quality.  I understand they're just headphones for kids not high-end headphones.Cute but disappointing...
I‚Äôve been wanting to buy these because I‚Äôm am a fellow brony, so they seemed to work really well at first, but after a few months, the wire became faulty and stopped playing sound. I bought a new pair, but they stopped working after only a week. I am so disappointed. Do not buy these poor-quality headphones if you don‚Äôt want to waste your valuable money.
Granddaughter loves Peppa Pig. She kept asking for her grandfather's expensive headset so she could "play" with them. It was a no brainer to purchase these for her. They were a hit. I don't know how good or not they are because she just wears them like an accessory along with her little purse.
Worked great for our son on the plane for 2 hours.  We were able to plug these into his tablet for him to listen to while we flew.  They have a nice feature that will not allow it to turn up too loud, but it isn't that hard to bypass that as it is just a question on the screen, but for a 3.5 year old, he couldn't necessarily easily do it.He loves batman so the design was perfect and he even wears them from time to time while at home.On the return flight the part that plugged into the headphone jack appeared to have to be turned a certain way for them to work.  I will have to try other headphones in the jack to see if it was the headphone or if it was the device, but that is the reason I am giving it a 4 star at this time until I can check it out to ensure what the issue is.Update:  The headphones only worked for the flight out.  On the way back it had to be wiggled around to get it to work and it is the headphones as I have tested the tablet with other headphones.  I could hold it in the certain place and work fine, but that isn't really possible for a 3.5 year old.  I will be contacting the manufacturer to get a replacement pair for my son as he loves the batman theme to them.
Broke in 3 months....I guess for under $20 you get what you paid for
I was hesitant from the reviews but my daughter loves them! So far so good. The ONLY issue is that they‚Äôre supposed to be volume limiting and they‚Äôre pretty loud, the cheaper ones from 5 below have more of a limit on the volume but overall these are good
They stop working 3 days after she got them no sound at all
Very cute but was way too loose on my sons head after a few wears -
The wire feels very fragile and the gard that moves the ear buds up and down didn't work out of box.

This is a sanity saver for my grandson who has severe anxiety and neurodivergence.  It helps him get through crowded events and even school.
I loved it. works pretty well, just as described.
Pros: Everything except headband durability. The noise cancelation is awesome. The sound is deep. The feel is awesome.Cons: The headband is weak, as this is my third set of Sony headphones, and the last two broke at the headband, both at a different location. But due to other qualities I bought three of them so far. I don't know if that says something about my loyalty to Sony or what...
Vet comfortable and light weight. Good quality as expected from Sony.  Noise cancellation not quite on the level of my Bose but for half the price pretty good.  Controls are a bit confusing so perhaps I should read the instructions. Good sound, especially base.  Caddy was a nice bonus
They can get really uncomfortable if you wear glasses and it just kind of hurts. Even when I'm not wearing my glasses there isn't enough padding to keep my ears away from the hard plastic speakers.
excellent for the price
Headphones are very important to me. I struggle with focusing, but these headphones have altered my workflow and productivity SO much!
It worked as it should
They are definitely worth the price and very reasonable. Great sound quality and wonderful for my iPhone.
Great headphones with great sound quality. Would definitely recommend.

The headphones work but won't stay inside the port on my 8 yr old sons school laptop. Of course, his teacher didn't mention any problem to me since the beginning of the school year so now I can not return for a refund. His teacher recommended this brand too. Any chance on getting a replacement?
I listened to music on my phone, I also use it for recording on my phone, TikTok, YouTube...And the wire is already going in and out, I can only hear in one ear  unless I wiggle and manipulate the wire chord connection...And it won't stay.  I've only had it around a month or two...
They aren't great, and definitely not bad.For the price, I recommend them.  The mic pics up ambient noise to a reasonable level.Works on my mac.Pixel 5... They work, both mic and audio.  However, calls would randomly disconnect when it's plugged in.
Exceeded  my expectation.
Great for school use
The product came and broke 2days later
Like
The sound quality of this Headset is good and no one has ever complained about not being able to hear me through the microphone. However, the comfort of these headphones really starts to bother you after wearing them for more than about 30 minutes. I am in online meetings most of the day and my ears are hurting throughout the whole day until I take the headphones off for a break.
The left ear keeps going out. There's no rough handling of the item.  As I was recording the left ear just faded out.  This is the second pair I bought. 10/31/22
Was just what I needed

Good product for the price
I had a pair for about 5 years. I needed to replace the ones I had already. Great value for the price
Great for watching movies in full sound when everyone else has gone to bed. Also great for anyone with hearing loss. Gives them complete control of their necessary volume without blasting everyone else out of the room.
Bought These headphones when they first came out and I absolutely loved them! So ofcourse I had to get my hands on them again!!! I like to wear these while working out! They definitely cancel out noise especially a gym.
These were ordered for my daughter as a Christmas gift to replace her 3 year old ones.We are currently awaiting a  replacement pair because they broke within 2 weeks.
Great sound at a reasonable price
Like the volume button on these so I'm not always swiping
The sound quality is really good as is the noise cancellation these are really good headphones
The sound is awesome
DON'T LIKE THE SOUND, NEED TO TURN THEM UP TO HEAR THE VOICE , THEN WHEN SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS THEY ABOUT BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF, ALSO AFTER WATCHING A MOVIE WITH THEM I WIND UP WITH A HEADACH..

This headset has the capability to handle 2 devices at once, I use a computer and cell phone at the same time - it works well. Using the dongle caused problems with my compan'y's remote software.  It would bounce from working to not working just because of some sort of power save function I believe. Finally, over bluetooth, I get this issue where the sound fades in and out.  I don't know what this is.  It happens from my cellphone and from my computer so I know it isn't either of them since I own several sets of earbuds and headphones that do work with my devices through bluetooth and do not have issues.  It causes me problems when I am trying to concentrate on listening to others while they are attempting to show and tell with me. So anyhow, I was thinking of returning them since they are just at the 30 day window now, but I guess that will need to wait.
I didn't get this for X-Mas and Santa Claus did not deliver one to me. However, this is an amazing item that would be just as great as something I would imagine to be delivered directly by Santa Claus! It's expensive, but I feel like the build quality is there as long as I take care of it. I prefer the dual ear pads for business usage instead of those other models with just one ear pad. The weight of the entire headset is pretty light, maybe not as light as a single-sided ear pad headset but it's not heavy compared to one of those serious music over-the-ear style headphones. I would not wear this to the gym to workout, because I feel these might not hold tight enough against the head while you jog on the treadmill.Was able to connect the headset to both my PC and iPhone, however, I initially had trouble finding a way to switch between the two devices. I contacted their support team by phone and was able to get a hold of a team member. He explained that the company is still working on the latest version of the software. He advised that I download version 1.0 from and install that instead. Once I installed it, I was able to navigate to the "Bluetooth" section to Disconnect or Connect the device depending on what I wanted. It's a decent workaround while they work on the existing latest version of the software for iOS Bluetooth and PC USB connectivity.Battery life has been pretty fantastic so far, but I have used it only for a few days. Today was not too busy for me so I spoke using the headphones for a couple hours only. Left it uncharged all day (10+ hours) and when I pressed on the button to check battery life the digital voice said, "battery full". Not sure if this power status is true or not, but I guess I could leave it unplugged for a couple days to test? I'll leave it unplug for another day or so and if it still does not drain any batter then the digital voice status generated by the headset might be wrong.The headset feels comfortable wearing it for several hours at a time. I do feel a little warm around the ears after two hours straight, but nothing major (expected). It's a work headphone so I have not tested music or game. I have Sony headphones for those other types of activities.The mic is pretty awesome, it is clear and people have no issues hearing me. The background noise is held to a minimum. The boom mic is slick and swivels up and down, and you can wear it either side of the ear. It has a magnet that clamps to the top of the headset if you are not using it. SUPPOSEDLY you can mute the mic if you swivel the mic boom to the top....? I haven't tested it, but I don't care. It would be a bonus, but not important to me. I mute the mic by software or by pressing on the "down" volume button on the headset for a 1 or 2 seconds. The mute button on the headset works when you are on an active call, but it does not seem to mute if there is no active call going on.The busy light signal on the side where the mic boom is located turns on occasionally? I thought it only worked with Bluetooth, but one time I saw it light up when I just completed a call from PC USB connection to my VOIP system. Not sure why it was lit up, but I disabled it because it feels a bit gimmicky. I don't expect people to actually "know" that I'm on the call just by seeing the red circle light up. It's not bad though, I don't have any negative opinions about it.The USB to Micro USB cable that comes with it is long enough for me to connect and use with my PC. It's not super lengthy (slightly under 5 feet, between 1.2 to 1.5 meters?), but good enough to be used while you are sitting close to your laptop. Just do not expect that you can walk around your desk with the USB cable attached.One feature request would be to be able to view the battery charge percentage from Jabra Direct software? That would be nice if the headset's digital voice status is not accurate.Overall, I believe this device is expensive but it does seem to be of high quality material. The sound quality is excellent as far as conversation goes. The ease of connectivity is fantastic. The mute is easy to activate compared to other generic headsets. Highly recommended!Update (8/05/2019): I am giving this product a 4 stars instead of 5, because I just found out that the headset was down to 5% battery this morning. The software popped up a notification, but when I pressed the button on the right side of the headset the digital voice stated "battery full". I do not agree to be mislead on this information, so minus one star of an otherwise great product. It is still a recommended product, but I hope the battery does not short out in the near future.
Note that I'm using this mostly with Webex on a Win. 10 PC and via Bluetooth vs. the dongle that came with the device.Pros:Sound quality is great, both incoming and outgoingPairing with my Windows 10 PC via built-in Bluetooth was easyMute function works for me however Webex doesn't always detect (see below)Minor Cons:"Busy light" does not work for me at all - and when I turn it off manually, it comes back on by itself. Probably has to do with other apps that have access to the headset in the background.Also when I'm _not_ on a meeting and computer audio is not playing, headset makes 'bloodleoop' noises every min. or so - have no idea what this is supposed to indicateRE: mute function, the Webex setting to 'Sync mute button status on microphone device' does not always work. I've had experience where Webex says I'm not muted but headset says its muted. Be cautious :-)
I have a home office for my business.  I had a Sennheiser Bluetooth headset, but I junked it because calls would periodically deteriorate with static until I was disconnected.  The Jabra Evolve 65 works flawlessly.  It sits on the ear with a soft pad so it is extremely comfortable for long calls.  It came with a USB receiver I plugged into my Lenovo Thinkpad port replicator.  Consequently, the headset works well with Microsoft Teams and Zoom.  I recommend buying the Jabra Evolve 65 charging stand, it will support your headset and keep it charged.  Only downside is the non-user-removable battery; eventually the headset will probably have to be replaced, but I have no doubt it will last several years.  In sum, it was well worth the investment.  I also have the Jabra in-ear bluetooth headset which I use in the field.  It also works very well.  I have a healthy respect now for Jabra quality and design.
The most amazing headset. I'm on calls about 7 hours a day, and this headser does not hurt my ears at all. Sound is clear, easy to use and pack for trips.After 2 and half years, ine side broke, hanging by a line, I superglued, worked a few more months and finally gave up. Noneoftheless, I just bought a new one. I've tried at least 10 other types and none are as good as jabra.
I had to buy a second one. I do all my work from the coffee shop and am frequently attending meetings online. I tried all type of high end ear buds and headsets, looking for one with the best noise cancellation mics so those on the other end will not hear any noise. This Jabra is by far the best for that purpose.The headset does not fit tight so I frequently have to adjust it, and I still hear some background noise. But as far as those I am meeting with are concerned, I am coming across loud and clear even though music and noise from the coffee shop is all around me.Also, after about 1 year of use, the handle just broke! But I still went out to buy the same Jabra, because I still work out of the coffee shop!
Sound quality is fine for a VOIP headset. Voices are a robotic but come through clearly. For media, the sound isn't great... it'd be fine for background music, but isn't great for more focused listening as the quality is so so.Comfort drops off after prolonged use; if you're on one call and then off and can take the headset off it's not bad, but it gets a little uncomfortable after more than an hour or two.The Mic works great for Teams and calls via my cell, however Google meetings has very low volume with it.The battery life isn't bad. Not as impressive as I'd expected, but last the day on heavy use or a couple on lighter use.Build quality is light but seems a little flimsy, so issues so far but I'm just a week into using it.BT connectivity and range is good.Overall I don't feel it's a great value at one fitty US; I've had lower priced headsets with better comfort and performance, but we'll see how it holds up.
Been using this Jabra Evolve 65 UC headset every day for nearly 2 months now and I am very satisfied with it, both as a UC headset as well as general use headphones.For the last year my home PC has also been my work PC due to Covid WFH situations so I have it a co-mingled mix of my personal apps like video editing software, sound mixing software, and general use for watching Netflix or YouTube, and work apps like my Fuze softphone, Teams, Skype for Business, Zoom, and WebEx.  I've also paired this headset with my cell phone for hands free calling.  I've been really happy with how it performs in every case and can't think of anything that has been a major disappointment.The sound quality is quite good.  It's not $300 Bose quality but it is still enjoyable for casually listening to music or watching a video with no annoying qualities like tinny highs or muddy or lackluster bass.If I had to pick one weak spot it would be that the headphone part is passive noise cancelling, which just means it has foam cushions that cover your ears and blocks out some noise.  It works pretty well for ambient noise but I share an office with my wife and we are about 6 feet apart and when she is on a call I can hear her very clearly while wearing these Jabra headphones.  That said, I knew they were passive NC when I bought them so I can't fault them for this.The mic, on the other hand, does an EXCELLENT job of rejecting most any sound that I don't make.  I'll be on a call with my immediate team and my wife is being particularly animated on a call and I'll ask my team if they can hear her and everyone says they can't but I am loud and clear.  I'm quite impressed with the noise cancelling of the microphone on this Jabra Evolve 65 headset.  I've used them for voiceover work with my video editor and the mic sounds great there too.  Another nice thing is the headset has a built in mute for the mic.  I long press the vol down and it mutes the mic at the headset regardless of the app or phone connection being used at the time.I love the battery life. These headphones will make it through an entire day with plenty of battery life left.  I've left them on overnight and they were still working in the morning, and if I do get in a low battery situation they will work just fine while charging so I can plug them in and let them charge while I'm using them.Overall I am very pleased with the Jabra Evolve 65.  My wife has the Evolve 75 with active NC on the headphones and I've tried them out and didn't feel they were worth the additional money for my use, but it does work really well so if you are in a call center type environment you might consider spending the extra money for the headphone NC.  otherwise, these Evolve 65's are a fantastic headset and I definitely recommend them.
Read the directions you have to hold the Bluetooth button for 3 seconds to connect. I only say this because so many reviews say they can not connect.. my only complaint is they are a bit loose on my head and fall off if I bend over to pick something up.
The sound quality, light weight and noise cancellation and can wear for longer period are good part of headphone and I liked all these features. One thing I didn‚Äôt like is not easy to connect charging cable to headphone and charging cable pin pin does not go easily , otherwise everything is good

Just received them. In my opinion, they are excellent cans for the price! Tried them with my phone and my audio system with amp. Nice cans. I'm not sure why some people complain about bass. Plenty of natural bass. It depends on your source, of course. But even with my VERY old Samsung phone they are excellent! Do not compare these cans with $400 + ones! Again, for the price they exceeded my expectation.  Will update after a week or so.
Love em great sound I will buy more of these.
Awesome and clear sound quality Very happy with this purchase.  Noise reduction also great.
Por el precio brinda un sonido excelente!
These headphones were for guitar practice. I haven't even used them for that and I'm already ready to return them. they are very uncomfortable. The cups really are so small. I have a small head and they were so tight. I paired them with my MacBook, sat in them and I'm sorry these are just too uncomfortable. The sound is also not that big of a deal. I need them for my amp so I had no intensions of using it for anything else. I've heard better. And because these aren't very multi task for me and they aren't very comfortable I'm going to return them. 50 dollars is still a lot of money to pay for something from this brand. Hopefully my other headphones will do the job.
They are nice but the opening for the ear seems a bit narrow. Ear fits in but too snug which I am waiting to see if it irritates them cause it's the reason I was looking for over ear, to not irritate them. Will update if they do.
These headphones are really good. The sound quality is superb, the design is sturdy and light, and is comfortable to wear for hours at a time. I have had no issues with using the Sennheiser HD 400S.
I'm not a power audio studio user. However, these guys have impressed me on my guitar practice sessions. Wire extension is short so might be uncomfortable in some occasions
The overall quality is simply one of the best around the price. But the volume is a bit low (or smaller) than other headphones, which isn't a big problem when you simply raise the volume.
They‚Äôve held up with a teenager using them daily for 3 months. Says they are working as expected and isn‚Äôt left wanting more.
https://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-BT-600ANC-Bluetooth-Headphones-Cancelling/product-reviews/B08P6959XC/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews
Basically, out of the box I loved almost everything about the BT-600 ANC... except sound, ironically.These are my personal "rankings":-PACKAGE-  8/10The headphones come in a pretty hard shell case, which while bulky is a great plus since many other cans in this price range don't come with anything more than a mesh pouch or something similar.Included are a 1.0 m long slim detachable audio cable and a very short USB-A to USB-C (thank god) charging cable.You can easily replace both.The little manual will guide you through first use.-BATTERY- 9.5/10These things will last LONG, with mixed usage you will easily go through an entire week without needing to charge them, and much more with light usage.You don't get fast charging... but eh, it's a really minor thing considering the battery life.-DESIGN- 8/10They're somewhat anonymous, with minimal branding and a clean look (which I actually like a lot and one of the reasons for such a low price).But if you just want to "look super cool", these probably aren't for you.They don't have water resistance... but come on, who would expect that from these?-USAGE- 8.5/10The cans can be used wired-only (so battery off), wired but with ANC and volume control, or wirelessly with all functions enabled. Speaking of which, there are 3 buttons and a touch surface on the right earcup, the buttons are for power, ANC switch, Bluetooth pairing. With the touch surface you can control volume, play/pause, go through songs, answer calls... etc. More details in the manual.It takes some time to get used to... but it's nice overall.A lady voice will announce most actions, a bit annoying but it's fine.BE WARY that these don't have a dedicated companion app for customization and tuning, however.You'll need system audio settings or else third-party applications.-COMFORT and DURABILITY- 8/10 ; 7/10Considering their bulk, they're good. The memory cups are soft and comfortable, not super great but definitely won't destroy your ears. You may feel a bit of pressure on your head because the top padding isn't completely spread out, but it's pretty normal. Clamping force is alright, you'll barely notice a difference if you wear glasses.If these are uncomfortable for you then most over-ear headphones will be too anyway.Of course portability is not the best, but they're foldable so you can carry them with the case.They're plasticky, which is to be expected. It's decently sturdy, however.Just don't expect them to endure too many years of abuse and... don't sit on them.-ANC- 8.5/10ANC performance is surprisingly great for the price range. Of course we're not talking Airpods Max level, but those are like 7x the price, have no real case or high-quality codecs and barely work outside iOS... yikes.ANC covers low and mid-pitched sound while the passive cup isolation does the job with high frequencies.A tiny con is that using noise canceling introduces a slight hiss (expecially in the left ear). It's similar to white noise though so it's not really annoying or anything. It's normal with most ANC cans.You also have AMBIENT MODE which does the opposite effect and lets more sound pass so you can be a bit more aware.Then there is just passive which disables ANC and ambient mode.Whenever you put your hand over the right ear-cup, AMBIENT MODE will be temporarily activated and the volume lowered to a minimum so you can have a conversation if needed.For the record, you can use ANC and ambient mode even with the audio cable in, the cans automatically disable Bluetooth and some of the touch controls to save battery life.-BLUETOOTH- 8/10The range is above average, nothing groundbreaking. The BT-600ANC support Bloetooth 5 and a great number of high quality codecs (although it won't make too much of a difference, it's nice to see broad support in cheap cans). They can technically connect to two devices, but can only play audio from one at a time. Still useful if you want to quickly switch between phone and laptop, for example.-AUDIO- 6.5/10Now... the not so great part.If you're any kind of audiophile and/or young age, you may HATE the default sound profile.The bass is decent, but the sub bass is low, some of the mids are a bit too uneven, however the main issue is the highs (like, 13-20 kHz range) are very lacking.It's sort of consumer-friendly and won't fatigue your ears, true, and it's probably fine for people who only generically listen to typical music these days, yes.But for many other pieces, sound is very muffled and clarity is pretty disappointing.To make things even weirder, they actually sound somewhat different depending on if you use them wired, wired+battery, or wirelessly.Luckily with a lot of E.Q. fiddling I found good compromise presets and I can now fully enjoy these cans. Sound quality is not even bad, it's actually on par with the price range, it's mostly the default frequency response that's underwhelming and it's the only TRUE weakness of these cans. This is the only reason I can't recommend these to EVERYONE.The microphone is pretty serviceable, as a plus.-FINAL THOUGHTS-A pair of bang-for-the-buck minimalistic cans with premium features usually found in much pricier headphones, an outstanding battery life, adequate durability and portability, with the only glaring weakness being an underwhelming but forgivable default sound profile.
I need a pair of headphones with good ANC to block out the excessive traffic noise problem where I live, but I can't afford the ones from Bose or Sony, so I had hoped these would be a good alternative.  The good news is that the ANC works well enough that I can barely hear the law-breaking bikers and hot-rodders who use the public streets as their own personal race track.  The bad news is that the earpads are way too small.  Like toddler sized small.  For someone with adult sized ears, they just don't work.  After about 15 minutes, they become uncomfortable.  After 30 minutes they become painful.  And after an hour, it feels like someone has taken a razor blade and sliced up both my ears.  Still, compared to the mental anguish of listening to the 5th biker in the last 60 seconds who feels the need to rev their engine to 8000 RPMs as they go screaming by my house, maybe the physical pain is preferable.The bottom line is this: if Monoprice had made the earpads replaceable and made large ones available (even if they were an additional cost), I would probably give these headphones 5 stars.  But they didn't, so I'm giving them 2 stars instead.  I just can't rate a product that causes intense physical pain better than that, no matter how good their ANC is.UPDATE - November 14, 2022I'm bumping my rating to 4 stars because I've found a way to make these headphones work much better for me.  I discovered it's possible to stretch the earcups by wedging in a pair of multivitamin bottle caps for a couple days.  The end result is headphones that now seem to fit my ears, and I haven't had to re-apply the stretching for two weeks now.  At last I have a pair of headphones that I can wear for hours at a time that block the unwanted traffic noises and are helping me to find a path back to mental sanity.
For the price I was hoping for a bit better. I looked up a lot of reviews and these were highly rated, but I don't find them much better than some cheaper brands I've worn before. I don't enjoy the gesture volume and track adjustment which I found to be really finicky, and the ear cuffs aren't very comfortable.I wear glasses, and I saw some reviews saying these were comfortable to wear all day. That is NOT the case with me. Maybe it's because of the type of glasses I wear, but I can wear different brands of over the ear headphones for hours with minimal discomfort. These give me the headache from hell after wearing them for an hour, and honestly they hurt even when I don't have the glasses on. Maybe I have a jacked up head shape or something.
Going to start by disagreeing with tango's 1-star review which stated that the "touchpad is triggered by EVERYTHING brushing against it, however lightly." I did not find this to be the case at all. In fact, the fact that the commands are not as simple as a 'light swipe' is the only reason I am not giving the headphones 5 stars. My only criticism is that actually takes a bit more force than I expect sometimes to get the touchpad to sense my commands. It's more awkward than a button because you are sliding your finger across a soft leathery feeling surface...just a bit to get accustomed to if you are used to headphones with button commands. Because of this evidence, I would like to dispute tango's review and say that my headphones have yet to be involuntarily triggered.I like the headphones having 3 noise cancelation modes: noise-canceling, ambiance (hearing everything around you with the built-in microphones), and regular (noise-canceling and ambiance off, so it's like normal headphones). I also love that there is a mute mode by covering the touchpad. This is perfect for replying to someone's question before returning to studying, for example.I also like the fit. I previously had the Beats Studio 3 headphones and after wearing them all day my ears hurt. In these headphones, the ear cup sits over my whole ear, without even touching it on the inside. A lot more comfortable!The ANC noise cancellation is decent, without being over the top. I think that it is better than the Beats Studio 3 noise cancellation. You don't get as much of the "fan sound" as in the Beats ones which is a huge plus.In comparison to my old headphones, these are way better: about a fifth of the price, better sound, better comfort, better construction (don't look like they'll break as easily as the Beats did). Great value.
I've had two major problems with these Monoprice headphonesThe first was a break in the left ear. I used these headphones almost every day for work, but I haven't ever had any trouble with my old Sony MDR-V6 pair that I used before this.After securing an RMA for the original pair, I was told that I would have to wait for Monoprice to get the headphones back in stock. The initial estimate was for August of 2022, although Amazon still had the set in stock. I used my old pair of headphones for work until they arrived in late September. After a bit I realized that there were several related issues with the replacement pair. I discovered these issues while connected to my 2019 Macbook that I have for work.1. The audio would occasionally cut in and out2. The headphones would disconnect from the Mac's bluetooth3. The headphones would power off on their accord, rare but very troublesomeAfter contacting Monoprice they said that my headphones were out of warranty and that we could not troubleshoot or swap out the replacement headhphones.Timeline:07/12/2021  Initial purchase of Monoprice headphones via Amazon05/27/2022  Headphones broke while still under warranty, replacement requested09/22/2022  Finally received replacement headphones10/19/2022  Sent message about 3 disconnecting issuesMy points of contention are this:1. Had I received the headphones in a timely manner, I would have still been under warranty, instead of waiting 4 months2. I was sent a defective product as a replacement. I would think they would be replaced regardless of warranty statusI unfortunately cannot recommend Monoprice headphones again to friends and family. The price was nice, but the quality and support is lacking.
+ Very good build quality and material+ Sound quality is very good I prefer it with noise canceling off+ Microphone quality is excellent for calls+ Very comfortable on the ears, I even had 30 mins run with them and they were stable+ Bluetooth connection range is fantastic+ Battery life is very good and charges very quickly with USB-C (if you have a fast charger)- Not for hot days run, the sweat just builds up and the material isn't built for sports- I wish it remembered my setting as I have to turn off ANC and Ambient every time I use the headphones- Turning off ANC and Ambient you have to wait for the voice confirmation that it is off, wish it was a switch or quick on/off- Doesn't turn off automatically when not used (Bluetooth has to be disconnected for it to power off automatically after 5 minutes)
So I decided to get these on a whim after minimal research on them. The sale was nice. These are my second pair of noise canceling headphones, and these are way better than the Sony NC headphones I had in high school. The touch controls are intuitive, they're very comfortable, and the combination of noise canceling and active sound is really great.Personally I didn't realize how noisy my space was until I used these. A great deal for the sale price, and I believe that even at full price, these are worth it. The quality is not like high impedeance headphones with a dedicated amp. The sound quality is still decent.[Update]These headphones were really nice while they lasted, but sadly mine broke less than a year after purchasing. There seems to be a weakness where the Y joint of the band is. Maybe I'm just a bit too rough with my gear. I did coddle these though, but a 2ft drop onto carpet did them in. If you are going to treat these very gingerly, than they're good for you. If not, maybe look into other options.
really nice headphones for the price range, the band is a little small though
Priced right. Work well.
Quality isn't that great. It's extremely hard to use the touchpad to control the media. Also, the volume range isn't that great (especially the lowest possible sound level, which I'm concerned with).

Had a very nice pair of Bose that got "borrowed" from me on an international flight, decided I wasn't going to spend that much on another temporary set of NC earphones, I found this model by Sony.  It was about $50 at the time, which was only a quarter of my first (now traveling somewhere without me) NC headset.  I really like the simplicity and affordability of them, haven't lost these because they look so plain :-)Sound is clear, sound reduction is decent, have recommended them to several cabin crew and fellow passengers, even bought a couple sets to give my parents when they retired and took the 'round the world' dream trip they'd been saving and planning for, having NC headsets was equally appreciated by them!They do not come with any sort of stowage bag included, so recommend you grab something appropriate to keep the kit (headset and cord, it's included legacy airline twin-plug adapter, and a spare battery) neatly contained, rather than tossed loosely in your carry-on bag.  I found a very simple cloth "cosmetic brush" bag that fits the bill perfectly, YMMV.I mention these have a couple minor drawbacks...First, if you're looking for Bluetooth or wireless, these are wired use only.  On the other hand, their cord and simple appearance also makes these look to be an ordinary set of headphones and not a desired theft item.Second, these are not rechargeable, and it is easy to forget about powering down after a flight, so good idea to carry an extra AAA battery in your kit.  On the other hand, the power switch is not easily bumped, so you won't accidentally turn them on in your bag, and the battery drain is rather low so that even after a couple days sitting "ON" in my bag, they were still working.Overall, a very worthy purchase, and an item I recommend to others, though I think Sony could have stepped them up a notch by giving them rechargeable capability, via USB cable or such, and knock off a star for that reason in hopes they consider this feedback as a suggestion of how to improve an already decent product -- sometimes the little bits of customer input is all it takes to effect change, right?  This whole BT trend, not a huge fan myself, but point it out for those that want BT connectivity on everything.
Havent gone to the trouble of putting a battery in it. Not exactly what I was looking for but they work well enough. The padding is good except when I fall asleep on them for 8 hours.
Not bad for the price. Not the most comfortable. Not the best noise cancelling. Not the best sound. But for the money, they are better than the cheap ear plugs provided by the airline.
I was pleasantly surprised by this headset. I usually use Bose's $300+ noise cancelling headphones, but wanted something smaller and lighter. These headphones muffle noise, but don't entirely cancel it. They are on the ear, which is new to me, and I like it very much. Good enough sound quality, light weight, stays on my head while I move around with an MP3 player in my pocket. I am so glad I bought these, and got a very good price that day. A very happy music lover and audio book lover. Thanks, Bose. But they aren't noise cancelling, so I took off a couple of stars for the misleading description.
I bought these back in 2016 and have used them on and off since then. Most recently as a college student, driving my need for wireless option.SOUND QUALITY: While the sound quality is adequate, I am a person who loves heavy bass, which this does not give, but the sound quality overall is pretty good.NOISE CANCELLATION: It also does not completely cancel out noice, but does muffle/buffer it. In Starbucks, I had to turn up the volume on my computer to 75% to drown out talking. Likewise, poolside at the YMCA, I also have to amp up the volume to get any true buffering from the high sound. I am easily distractible so these are not ideal for noise distractions.  Even at home with dogs and kids, I find that, no matter what, I have to amp up the volume for buffering, otherwise I hear quite a bit.  I don't notice a significant difference in turning off the ANC. The same goes for vacuuming, yard work (such as using a blower) and mowing the lawn.COMFORT: The headphones are over ear and pretty comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. I have yet to experience significant fatigue from it.  I don't notice any extensive sweating while wearing them, either, which some have said is an issue with over the ear headphones. Granted, I'm not sleeping in them, either.DURABILITY: Over the several affordable on/over ear headphones I purchased for my daughters' use with online work, these were the ones she kept coming to and the only ones that have held up over the years. The cord is pretty durable, especially since I don't have a case for it and it often gets tossed into a drawer or backpack willy-nilly (yes, an outdated term, I know).COMPARABILITY: I have tried the Bose SoundLink II and Beats Solo3, both wireless headphones. If you are looking for comparable sound, you won't find it. Both Bose and Beats have these headphones beat, as would be expected based on price! However, I see quite a few complaints regarding durability of the material over time. I have no experience with comparison of Bose or Beats as these are recent purchases from family members. I can attest to the durability of my Sony headphones.CONVENIENCE: I like that my Sony headphones can work well with my 2018 MacBook Pro, as Apple didn't see fit to change the headphone jack for any of their computers from the 3.5mm jack to a lightning jack. I use the adapter on my iPhone and it works fine. I've used these headphones to run on a treadmill several times and they stay put. I'm not running sprints or marathons, though. However, they are wired, and wired ONLY. Meaning I can't be wireless, and they don't connect to my iWatch.For convenience due to connectivity with all of my devices, I would say that Beats Solo3 Wireless has everything I need, since I have all Apple devices and I really like having everything working together. Even my Alexa devices and Alexa Compatible plugs work harmoniously together and with my Apple devices. As a result, I will be looking for a wireless option that offers good durability and superior noise cancelling capabilities, though I won't be getting rid of these, as they really are great quality headphones, as expected with Sony (considering I grew up in a time where Sony was considered right up there, before Bose became a more well-known entity in the market).
I'm a  classical musician that listens to everything. I own the $15 Koss UR 18 ( comfy and with decent bass for the price) which are good at their price range. I also own $75  Senheisser HD 280. They are bulky with very good passive isolation, and more natural sound.I had the $450 Beats Pro for a while, and they were great for popular music , with control talk, great bass, and superior to all other beats.Now about these pair or Sonys:Sound: they have more bass and treble than the Senheisser 280, but these Sonys sound a bit hollow. For the price range it is Pretty good, I guess. Nothing impressive.  I like their boomy bass for some styles of music.Isolation: They reduced the bathroom fan and the bus ramble very noticeably. Voices are softer but at the same time you can hear words more clearly. So keep those differences in mind.(** update: two days later, it's been a few times that people talked to me in the house while listening to angry rock at 40% of volume and I did not hear them at all).Having said that, they're not as good as the Bose QC 25, but they are exactly  ten times cheaper.Portability: They fold flat and small in a way that is super compact. No bag included.It uses a AAA battery , easy to use, and it comes with one.Cons:No control to pick up calls.Trebles get harsh after an hour or so, and it hurts a bit, unless you can equalize it well. Sound can be a bit hollow in the middle.Comfort:They are very comfortable even with glasses on. My head is small though.I paid $30 for them, and sometimes I prefer them over the Senhheisser hd 280 to listen to music on the go, specially bass oriented music.The Senheisser are better at blocking higher pitch sounds ( ppl , tv, etc) bc they are big and press against your head, so I kept them for those situations.These Sonys have the *active* noise canceling , which improves their sound. >>>They still work without it, though. So you can listen even without batteries. Sound loses boom and volume, but they work.I'm pretty happy with them for the price. Note:When  I tried the $300 Bose Quiet comfort 20 the store went silent. Bass was not impressive. These under $50 Sony pair are probably not as good at isolating ( a 25% less, maybe?) but they are so much  cheaper at Best Buy or here,  and smaller. The bass is sweet, too.For a cheap option in casual portable listening with isolation, I'd give them a try. If you're an audiophile, or listen to classical exclusively, keep looking.I hope it helps!
Love these things. I use them all the time.
I use headphones for watching shows on my laptop. These headphones sound was so muddy that I sometimes could not make out what was being said by the characters. I switched back to my other headphones to make sure it wasn't something with the show audio, and everything sounded fine on them. I also dislike that the earpads are really small and not well padded. I returned these headphones.
Bought these for lawn mowing. Best pair I've found for under $50 that will actually keep the mower sound to a minimum. Would buy again
Wear them at the gym. Can not hear people next to me talking for an hour. Can not hear the loud music over the sound system. Can not hear the guy vacuuming all around me. CAN hear the music from my I-Phone loud and clear!

This is my second pair.  First lasted 6 years.  Good quality sound.
I'm satisfied with these headphones, though I did find them much cheaper from Walmart, and Cowin.
I bought these to replace an identical pair that broke after quite a few years of use.Where the new headphones did connect and worked fine with the Pixel 6 and Chromebook, the sound quality on the TV was very poor. It was like trying to hear underwater.I reached out to the manufacturer for technical support. They did help and was working on a warranty resolution. After reviewing the receipt, they would not assist further because I purchased from Amazon.I reached out to Amazon and they declined to assist with the problem because the purchase had just passed the 30-day window to return them.The situation is quite a disappointment.
The sound quality is fantastic. Great battery life and noise canceling.
I absolutely adore these!!! I've had a pair of these for a few years & they were perfect. Finally started to show wear so I replaced  with a new one. Didn't bother to shop around whatsoever. Nice work Cowin!!! I would 100% recommend to anyone:)
They are good at noise cancelling (l live on a busy street and use them to bluetooth to my smart tv) and they are great quality.
These are reliable and sturdy.  Great buy.
I did buy E7 for half the price a few years ago. It‚Äôs a really great product. I still have it though left ear is broken mechanically. And I need to push it back every time I put them on. So I decided to move up the ladder and try E8 at higher price. Feel cheated after receiving the exact same E7 model for twice the price.
I have been trying to contact your customer service department since beginning of August and have yet to receive an email or have my phone call returned despite leaving voicemails and sending multiple emails. I purchased these headphones 2 years ago and they have completely fallen apart to the point where I can no longer use them. This has severely hindered me as a college student. The headphones were always stored and handled properly. Product just seems cheaply made, yet cost $150 USD. The about info leads you to believe they are a USA company, but they are actually Chinese! TERRIBLE QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
The product was built flimsy

Amazing headphone loveeee durable but I would replace the aux cord right away been only a month and already broke that has been a running theme with these and getting stuck in iPad or tablets so make sure you buy like a 6 pack of detachable aux cord standard 3.5mm male to male I believe should work.
After a month of using the headphones, the audio jack broke off inside the hole on my daughter's ipad. I reached out directly to the company via email (skipped amazon customer support) and they were very quick to respond and offer a solution. They recommended I take the ipad to an IT store to have the audio jack piece removed (the store removed the metal piece without taking the ipad apart & free of charge), they refunded my order for the broken headphones and shipped out replacement headphones the same day with quick deliver a day or two later. Amazon has a 30 day return/refund policy on this product but the company, Lilgadgets, has a 1 year warranty that covers defects. I took off 1 star for the fact that they did break and cause an inconvenience by having to take the ipad to the IT store but I would definitely buy this product again after such a great experience with their customer service.
Where do I begin. First of all these are an amazing quality. I'm an adult with a small head. I believe these are tailored for children so it worked perfectly for what I needed. They were incredibly soft and comfortable. Also I love the fact that they had brilliant color choices because black gets so boring and if you have to wear something like this, make it stylish! This company just gets it I think in terms of that observation and from what I've seen of their customer service .  They really do care about their customers.I ordered the green which is my favorite color and absolutely loved it. It looks exactly like it does in the pictures that you see so there's no filters used. I have to state that because I've ordered a lot of things recently where I can tell what I received was not what I thought I was buying. The sound quality was excellent, along with the volume controls and while I was listening to my audiobooks I heard absolutely nothing.They don't cancel out noise completely which is actually why I bought these. Since the quarantine started for us in March, my husband has had to work from home and unfortunately he only has one volume and that's super loud. I can't get upset with him for the circumstances so I have to try and find a way of dealing with it to get my peace of mind. I need peace and quiet and that's why I am looking into sound cancelling headphones.If you want to wear them around the house to block out noise without listening to anything, these will not particularly work for that. Then again I also have very sensitive hearing. My eyes are terrible so I suppose my ears compensate for what they can't do. But in terms of purchasing it to use to listen to audio books, movies or games for yourself or your child these are perfect and you will not hear anything else other than what is in your ears.Also the fact that there are two ports -one in each ear that you can plug in to so you can listen to what the other person is listening to I feel is an excellent feature to help children and adults be engaged with another  and share in a great listening experience whether it's a audiobook, music or movie.The sad part is I had to return these. Very reluctantly. I got into a bad accident over a year ago where I got hit in my Trigimenal nerve on my face. Pretty much I have a life sentence of nerve pain so anything on my left side of my face or my ear and jaw is incredibly uncomfortable. These were very soft but unfortunately still too hard for my medical situation because there's  sensitivity issues going on. Also since my ear also got impacted it's a bit jammed. I believe because these headphones are circular shaped that was the other issue for me. I assessed the situation and decided not only did I need something that was close to feeling non-existent on my face but either had no particular shape or had more of an oval shape because my ears are more along those lines. So with a heavy heart I had to make the decision to send these back and settled for the headbands with the earphones in them which seems to be working for my particular situation right now but do not nearly do as good of a job of canceling noise is these headphones do.If you don't have any particular issues like myself that are medical-related please consider purchasing these for yourself or your child and the colors are just amazing and they will not be disappointed. The quality cannot be beat. If I had a normal situation I definitely would have kept these.
I bought these for my daughter and she loves them. Easy to use and cleanThe volume also doesn‚Äôt go outrageously loud which I like
These are cushy and come in a ton of colors/patterns. I love that the cable is detachable and you can string them together.We bought these in December. The cable frayed in March. Not sure if my 7 y.o. was twisting it up, or what, since that seems quick, but then, my kid is rough on things. I Emailed pictures, the order number, and my mailing address to their customer service department and they sent me a new cable. Another 3 months goes by and the hinge breaks. I sent pics of that and they sent me a new set of headphones.We've got an expensive brand of headphones for my teen and when the hinge broke, we had to box it up and mail it in for a repair. Understandable, but a pain. I love how simple it is to just get another pair sent out with LilGadgets. I'm pretty sure my littlest could break a tank without trying too hard, so it's a life saver to have such an easy process for using the warranty. Quick response and no hassle. Two thumbs up in that regard. I'll be buying more of these headphones in the future!
Perfecto, mi hija qued√≥ contenta, buen dose√±o y buen sonido.
Para la escuela de la ni√±a. Muy buena compra
After going through multiple cheap headphones for my daughter to use at school we finally decided to spend a little more money and purchase these. The headphones have not only held up longer than all the others, they also seem to block out more noise so she can focus on her reading assignments/classroom work while at school. Worked so well we purchased the same kind for our other child.
Late writing this. We bought these for school. After a month the metal on the headphones came apart. The teacher sent them home. Still trying to get a replacement cord, which has not gone well.Aside from the cord, the headphones are nice, comfortable, and the sound is good.
Durable and sturdy for an elementary user. Like that the cord plugs in and works in either direction. Love that two headphones can plug into each other and then into the same device to watch the same movie. Genius. May have to get headphones for me so I can watch the movie too!

I use with my Yamaha P71 keyboard. They work perfectly fine at a low price. Sound is ok and fit reasonably comfortable. Perfect for not disturbing neighbors. Light weight and adaptible connection plugs included and Long chord. These are not $100 phones but do the job.
I was surprised at the sound quality for the money. I purchased for when I practice my electric piano. They sound great!
Exactly what we needed to plug into our Yamaha keyboard.
Great sound quality for Yamaha keyboard instruments. These are not noise canceling and nor enclosing the ear. They go on the ear very comfortably.Light weight. The cord is all smooth no curling in the cord. Many other ear phones have curling chords that can pinch the hairs on you arms when playing a musical instrument. Even just listening a Curley corded earphone will snatch your clothing or hairs on your body. The cord on these earphones are smooth straight. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Don‚Äôt spend more money, these are priced great and work fine. Unless you need ear warmers and Curley cords.
I was looking for a headset to go along the Yamaha Piano and this headset fits perfect. Great sound, great comfort.
They aren't flexible enough. I should have bought a one ear headphone for DJing my bad.
Prior to getting this, I had bought and returned two other generic cordless and corded headphones, attempting to use it with my Clavinova CSP170.  One was too short to cover my ears when fully extended (truly starnge as I've never had that before) and the other wouldn't connect.This Yamaha headphone works charmingly easily.  The sound quality is soooooo clear and the stereo effect is so real that every time I started playing I had to take it off to make sure the sound came from the headphones, not the piano. LOL  Absolutely love it!The only drawback is that it's not very comfortable.  The earpiece is tight not enclaving your ears inside completely.  And I haven't played longer than 30 minutes in a setting to tell since I got it to know if it'll be comfortable enough for longer usage.  Even with that, I wouldn't give it up just for the sound quality.
Right out of the box I immediately noticed that they feel very thin and cheap. They are very uncomfortable to wear and a Tully feel as if they would break if I wasn't careful with how I  put them on. I realize that they are not top of the line headphones for the price, around 40 bucks, but I have used a pair of 20 dollar Sony headphones that blow these out of the water for the price range. I'm very disappointed with the quality and feel of these headphones and wish I had chosen another brand.
I‚Äôm stunned. I had a solid pair of general use headphones (Bose $200 set) that I had plugged into my digital piano and was happy with it for a while. However, I got my mother in law these Yamaha headphones for her keyboard for Christmas and she was in love with them so I got them for myself as well. I‚Äôve played with them a lot now and the difference is very noticeable!I was stunned at the acoustics and how pleasant my piano experience has become. Love them. Great value for the price! I would definitely recommend them to anyone who uses headphones to practice piano.The main downside I would mention about these headphones is they don‚Äôt seem very snug around the ear as they are just on-ear and seem a bit awkward at first. As long as you‚Äôre not thrashing your head too wildly as you play, you should be fine ;)
I use these for a digital piano and they are comfortable with good sound quality.

These are pretty darn wonderful, but you should know, this is my first upgrade from earbud style headphones and that is my only point of comparison. But if you are tiptoeing into the more expensive world of fancier headphones to get your audio thrills like me, I can say that I am super happy with this investment.My setup: I paired these headphones with DragonFly Cobalt DAC, Amazon Music Hi Def streaming, iPhone to USB camera adapter. The first night I had these, I couldn't stop listening to music, because it was like I was hearing my favorite albums for the first time again. Constant goosebumps and visceral sensations from just being able to hear more in the music and with a stronger sense of space and left/right channel movement. The improvement in my listening experience is pretty astounding. I am not exaggerating to say at one point, listening to Jacob Collier, I heard some glorious new pretty that made me think I was feeling a tear welling up in my eye!I ordered this pair specifically because the price was greatly reduced on a pair of  headphones listed as "used, like new", which arrived with a "refurbished" sticker on the box.  The excellent deal pretty much was the decision maker on my model choice and alleviated some of the financial pain of also needing to invest in a headphone DAC/Amp + iPhone adapter to make this step up in my listening experience. I agree that the "like new" assessment was accurate. I see no signs of wear or any signs that these are not just new headphones. My only complaint is that they smell like they've been sprayed with some kind of household deodorizer (I won't mention brand names, but you find it in the cleaning aisle, not in the perfume aisle - so it's not someone's personal fragrance left behind on the soft materials). It's pretty much the exact same smell that all of amazon's blue and white bubble plastic shipping bags smell like. I don't know where the fragrance fairies are in this process -at sennheiser refurbishing?, at the shipping warehouses? in my local delivery trucks?  but I spent my first hour listening with utmost joy to my music while also fighting off an asthma attack from the fragrance. That's how good these sound, I was willing to endure asthma to keep listening, but really, can the fragrance fairies stop this business? You might literally kill someone. For what I saved on these headphones though, I'm willing to air them out for a few weeks. And other than the asthma, they are otherwise very comfortable to wear , even after a day of wearing a mask that rubs the back of my ears raw. I've felt teddy bears less soft than these ear cushions. They're pretty sweet.If you are like me and new to this process, I do want to confirm that open back headphones are truly audible to those around you, even at "save your hearing" volumes. So these are definitely "at home" headphones. Since I was aiming to give myself a tool for inducing happy-brain sensations and deep relaxation after a stressful workday, these suit my needs perfectly. My intention was to use these someplace quiet and private. If you need something for travel, or to drown out outside noises, these aren't going to be well matched to that need. If you want a music goosebumps and can match these with a Hi-Def music source and headphone amp/DAC, then these should make you very happy.
I have a pair of Sennheiser HD438's, but I hadn't used them much in the recent years. I was more into TWS earbuds and then transitioned to wired IEM's. I recently dug out my old Sennie's for a change and really appreciated the forgotten comfort and sound signature.  So, I decided to research today's headphones. The HD 599 SE was in the right price bracket (I've spent way too much already, according to my wife!!) and the reviews gave it high marks for soundstage, comfort, sound signature and open-back bass. I knew Sennheiser was durable. My HD438's are still in excellent condition after 11 or 12 years.  The SE traditional coloring is much better suited to my taste than the HD 599..DESIGN & BUILD:The Industrial Stylist at Sennheiser must have a really tedious job.  I was surprised how similar my 11-year-old HD 438 is to the HD599.  No major styling change there in all that time!  At least that shiny spoke pattern, which reminds me of my truck wheels, is gone!  The headphones are equally comfortable, with a touch more pressure on the HD599.  My glasses are not forced onto my head though and I can wear these for hours.  The oval earcups are quite large vertically, like the HD 438, and fit my big ears perfectly to be truly ‚Äòover-the-ear‚Äô ‚Äòphones.  I have room to spare, but not much!.While these headphones are made of plastic, they are very strong and you‚Äôll struggle to break them.  You can twist and spread these around and not crack anything..I‚Äôm not a fan of the dedicated 2.5mm (?) twist-lock connector into the headphone, but at least there are aftermarket replacements available.  I have no idea why the adapter on the longer cable is a large female to small male and the large male 6.35mm connector is on the cable.  The cable should be 3.5mm and the adapter should enlarge the connector.  With the adapter on, the cable end is just too honking big!.My only criticism would be the headband adjustment.  I liked the SHP 9500 with its strong detent and numbering system.  I find the headband can go out of adjustment too easily handling the headphones and I have to judge the gap in the headband visually for my best fit..SOUNDSTAGE & IMAGING:When I got the HD 599 SE, I plugged them straight into my phone and was totally blown away.  The frequency curve is essentially neutral with a hint of coloration.  The bass rolls off below 40Hz but the treble stays strong right up to the 20kHz limit.  The mids are slightly cool but are certainly not ‚Äòrecessed‚Äô.I felt like‚Ä¶- I was in a room with the musicians.  The reproduction was totally natural.- The bass was really solid, surprisingly so for an open-back headphone.  Maybe not bass head worthy, but punchy, crisp, and realistic.- The treble was clear, detailed and ‚ÄòSennheiser smooth‚Äô.  I really liked my Momentum TW2 earbud sound signature, but as buds go, they are dated (app and ANC) compared with other brands and I ended up returning them. ‚òπ‚ÄòHold me now‚Äô by the Thompson twins, ‚ÄòHoney and the Bee‚Äô by Owl City, and ‚ÄòAppetite‚Äô by Prefab Sprout can be quite harsh, even sibilant, at the upper end on all my IEM's and some of my TWS buds. I like a bright sound, but not sibilant and grainy. The HD 599 SE was so natural sounding and just‚Ä¶ gorgeous.- The soundstage is what I've been seeking and missing with closed back and in-ears.  Hotel California - Live on MTV 1994 by the Eagles sounds amazing. That punch at 32s is awesome. ‚ÄòStrive‚Äô by Amber Rubarth, ‚ÄòKilling me softly‚Ä¶‚Äô by Roberta Flack, 'Unearthed - Orchestral version' by Wildpath, and ‚ÄòYour Grace is enough ‚Äì Live‚Äô by Matt Maher are just sublime.  There‚Äôs both width and height with correctly mixed tracks.  Try listening to ‚ÄúBest 8D song EVER with headphones 2021 ‚Äì HD‚Äù on YT.  Awesome!- Imaging is also superb and it‚Äôs easy to pick out the location of instruments.  ‚ÄòBuck Dance‚Äô by Dick Schory‚Äôs New Percussion Ensemble has your senses tracking all over the stage!.I‚Äôd not used open back headphones before trying the SHP 9500 and I actually liked the feel and openness, compared with closed-back.  However, the SHP 9500 did not have the sound staging I was after.  The HD 599 SE certainly does.Of course, you need to use these in a quiet room to save your ears.  With the 106dB sensitivity and 50 Ohm impedance, I do have to use 70 to 80% volume directly connected to my phone, compared with 40% on my IEM‚Äôs.  Still plenty loud enough for me, but you may not agree.  Please take care of your hearing though!.I have a collection of Earbud Test Tracks, which I use to assess my earphones‚Ä¶.https://music.amazon.com/user-playlists/6c1a03929ed947ab82cc33db24d7c001sune?ref=dm_sh_c7f9-3dba-7009-a4cd-8323a.I usually use a Qudelix 5K DAC/AMP.  I loaded Oratory1990‚Äôs HD 599 PEQ and with the HD 599 connected, I noticed that it cleaned up the lower/mid bass just a tad.  On some tracks, the bass can get a little muddy. I felt that a little more treble was needed and slightly less bass though to suit my taste.  So, I adjusted the PEQ and I now have my final settings (see photo)..CONCLUSION:For a consumer-friendly price, you are truly entering Audiophile territory with the HD 599.  I have no reticence in stating that.When the HD 599 go on sale, they are an absolute must-have.  I bought these for the current price of $150.  I still think that‚Äôs a steal!The HD 599 SE are now my go-to for serious listening late at night and I think they could be yours also!
Me likey:+ Sound quality is great+ Very comfortable+ Not gaudy like other sets+ Super reliableMe no likey:- They‚Äôre very priceyWireless seems like the way to go these days, and maybe it is. But I‚Äôm in the position where I don‚Äôt have to have a wireless set so, if I don‚Äôt need it, I‚Äôll go with the reliability of wired phones any day.These Sennheisers sound terrific and they work as advertised. I own two sets and never had to worry about them working. No interference whatsoever, and they‚Äôre super comfortable to wear. I can wear these for hours on end without discomfort. What‚Äôs more, they‚Äôre narrow at the ear pieces, so I don‚Äôt look like an alien or robot while wearing them.These headphones come at a price; a hefty one. At the time of this writing, the price has been reduced, but I paid $200 a piece for my sets. Sure, they‚Äôre comfortable and they sound great, but that‚Äôs still a hefty chunk of change. Only consider paying for these if you‚Äôre serious about your audio.
Edit:In spite of wonderful sound and very comfortable ear cups, I returned these to Amazon.I am an engineer and therefore really picky about design and I hope this saves somebody a bit of research.I just couldn't live with the head band of these.  It almost defies understanding that a company as fantastic as Senheisser would release a headband design like this.  I will say again, that the sound and ear cup comfort of the 599 is fantastic.  But they create a hot spot on top of the head where the head band with modest foam point loads the top of the head.  No reason for it.  Seinnheiser even understands this dynamic and sell both less expensive like the HD-559 and the more upscale HD 650 headphones with a much more padded and headband with a void at the top of the head which could cause irritation.If you guys and girls want to take the dive, look into the Seinheisser HD-6xx which is a knock off of the venerable HD-650 which is twice the price of the 599. These headphones are magic.  Go out on youtube and watch some reviews.  Best $200 headphone on the market.  Just scored an open box purchase in new condition and these are even better in both sound and comfort to the 599.  I had NO complaints about the sound quality of the 599 but I need complete comfort.  Hope this helps and happy listening.I don't write a lot of reviews but I come from the world of tech and appreciate all genres of music.  I recommend everybody interested in the HD 599 to go to youtube and watch some reviews which will be in more depth than mine.I am returning to earphone listening after many years.  I built a new AMD CPU based computer which btw I love without a dedicated GPU but with Asrock on board sound which drives these headphones beautifully.  Because of their low impedance, not essential to drive them through a dedicated amp.Comfort:Comfort for me for overall listening is ESSENTIAL.  It is largely why I bought these.  I have largish ears and where a large hat...not a small guy but not a huge guy either.  I struggle with the comfort of many headphones.  Not these. They are the best. Sennheiser gets it.  Other companies not so much.Ear pocket are very large to completely cover my largish ears and my ears though not tea cups stick out a bit...not excessive but require deep and large ear cup openings.  These deliver.What isn't understood about earphone design many times is...its a balance of clamping force to the head that determines headband pressure.  Higher the clamping force, the less the head band pressure because lateral force negates vertical fall of the headphones.  Many headphones with drivers and fidelity this size are heavy.  These weigh 250 grams and are light.  Therefore they don't require big clamping...rated only at .71 lbs mean clamping...no doubt head width specific..  In summary, because of low weight they don't dig in up top of the head even with low clamping pressure.  Genius design and I am a design guy so I appreciate it.Sound:Wonderful.  I am not formally a senior...a very active senior and listen to classic rock to some even hip hop...very little, to opera and classical music.  I like it all from Mo town to some jazz to mostly classic rock which I grew up...the best music of all time. :-)  These headphones deliver.  Listen to the reviews.  They aren't flat...slightly embellished.  An audiophile headphone with a bit of lowest and highs added.  What the absolutely non purist wants in a headphone.  Very very slight embellishment...almost not.  I don't like too much bass but love to hear it.  My aging ears don't hear the highs like they once did.  I can hear the highs with these.  If I EQ them, I can tune them precisely how I like them.They sound magnificient.  Btw, they are open headphones and not meant to keep all the sound within.  That is design intent and what better listening headphones are.  On an airplane, pick a pair of Senn closed headphones.Looks:Looks matter.  I am a design guy.  Shape, texture and appearance affects perception of the product.  5 out of 5.  Perfect.  I couldn't design them better.  Arguably a 'hint' of retro.  Not as retro at the 598.  If only the 598 existed, I would get those but these are aesthetically more modern and better IMO.  The color is a bit unique.  You maybe tired of everything black like me.  These are a bit different and absolutely beautiful.I have owned other high end headphones from other companies. These are my favorite.  I only have had them for a couple of days. Even in the time I have owned them they have burned in and will burn in much more in the next 200 hrs of listening.My advice.  If you like, try everything but own these.Happy listening everybody.  Surf youtube for your favorite music.  Some brilliant young artists out there.
I used to be a budding audiophile, learned a lot about sound, music, and the art of equipment. Was a great time in my life, but damn expensive, lol, so that was that. Anyway, I upgraded from cheap earbuds to something more dynamic, and the Sennheiser HD 599 SE gave me that for a fair price. First music I went to was Faure's Requiem (DG), one of my favorites and covers plenty of range and it was.. Beautiful. Next I went for the epic experience of LOTR, Fellowship; and it was exciting to say the least. All the detail was there, I even heard things I don't recall hearing before, the lows were great, firm and punchy, big and smooth where needed. It had no problem bringing everything to life, so I am plenty satisfied with these. Audiophile or not, these are keepers and I will enjoy every minute of them.
So this year I really wanted to try open back headphones, it was a new world I found out about.  I have bluetooth aukey and anker earbuds, Sony XB900N, HyperX Cloud PS4 (same as pc,xbox versions), and other wired earbuds.  A big plus is I can hear my surroundings with open-back.  This fall I did research, and learned so much about audio that I didn't care for before, but now fascinated.  I'm still not doing the amp thing.  SO I hope this review helps someone.My ultimate two choices came down to Sennheiser HD599se and Philips X2HR.  These two are so opposite when it comes to available information on the web.  Tons of X2HR forums, reviews, videos, etc., and HD599se not so much.  I wanted an open back headphone, for primarily games, and secondary music and movies.I almost decided to keep both headphones because it was so hard to choose.  Here are the differences first:- X2HR too heavy for me. I thought it wouldn't matter.  Very comfy but gets heavy soon after and too noticeable.- X2HR definitely a boomier bass.  Think deep rich smooth.- HD599se, super comfy, probably my most comfy headphone.  Ears don't get hot or sweaty like my Sony ANC headphones.  Can wear for hours which others I kind of need to take breaks.The first headphone I opened was X2HR.  First song was a Paul Taylor's Push to Start.  I almost cried, I don't think I've experienced a wide sound stage before.  Deep bass and open audio experience like no other.  It was like listening to song you knew but in a different way.  Everything sounded great.  Then I listened to more Paul Taylor, then Tobu, Axero, etc.  Yeah there's awesome bass.Then I couldn't contain myself I had to try the HD599se.  First I was underwhelmed.  Not wide, actually felt almost like closed back headphones.  But I was surprised to hear bass, I was worried it would be non-existent.  There was bass, but not as much as X2HR.  Then I tried both on my PS4 controller.  Both can were loud enough so no issues here.Two days later I tried them again, but put on the HD599se first and listened.  They were actually really good, not as bad as I remembered.  Then I put on X2HR.  Now I noticed the differences clearer.  In Jazz, the sax was so much more clearer and cleaner.  Guitars sounds beautiful.  So much more balanced, not neutral, but everything is presented well.  X2HR, bass does cloud the instruments, as its more pronounced I feel.Ultimately, after listening to more music from tobu, axero, gramatik, jack johnson, nora jones, paul taylor, haywyre, etc., and playing ps4, I really wanted to keep both for different purpose.  But in the end I chose one because I knew I'd only use one most of the time.  Here's why I chose the Sennheiser HD599se:- Audio is very balanced, and easy to listen to most genres.  I like the bass doesn't overwhelm everything.  Everything is pretty much at the same level.  The instruments sounds much clearer.  Its like if the artist wants more bass in the song, you'll definitely notice it.  Its seems more a match for what the artist probably wanted you to hear.- I don't know if burn-in happened, or what exactly that is, but over time I feel like the bass and audio quality of HD599se got significantly better.  Or maybe its that it sounds better on my PC than phone, and that's when I notice it.- Hip hop, jazz, blues, etc was a pleasure.  Only edm sounded better on X2hr to me.- Gaming was much more enjoyable on HD599se. In FPS like call of duty, I could hear my surroundings better and anticipate people around me.  In sports games, I felt like crowd noise was overwhelming on X2hr, such as FIFA.- Super comfortable and light.- I spend alot of time already listening to music on the HD599se because its really good.  I appreciate these more and more as I listen to music.  I'm not analyzing, just listening and doing my thing.In closing, I wish I could keep both.  But won't.  I wish Sennheiser had a little more bass, but its enough.  You will hear the boom, bass hum, the usual, but just not as much or rich as X2HR.  I wish HD599se had wider soundstage, which the X2hr had.  Really like that openness... alot.  If you like lots of bass and don't mind to sacrifice some of the audio of the instruments such as sax, piano, guitar, and ok with heavier headphone, then X2HR is amazing.  I went back and forth so much between the two, and was hard to pick.  I had to really listen alot.  In the end I'm really happy with my decision and awesome black friday price. Maybe next year we'll see what options are available in the market.
I bought these headphones 3 years ago as a replacement in a line of about 10 previous headphones, between regular $25 pairs that get the job done to $300 beats. And even now, I can't seem to find a reason to "upgrade". These have some of the best quality sounds of any pair of headphones I've ever owned, even coming close to my old overpriced beats. The noise leakage is a bit much, but if that doesn't matter or you listen to them alone like me, you will be set for years on end. Top-notch for the price point. They also sound great no matter what you are listening to, whether it be hard rock or any old YouTube video.
The Sehhheiser HD 599s are very nice looking headphones and are the most comfortable of five sets I have tried. That said I want headphones to sound good as well and the HD 599s just weren't cutting it This is where the HD 599s fall a bit short in my opinion.The build quality is pretty decent, a bit plasticky, but otherwise nice. The Ivory color is different, but I them to be very pleasing to look at. The ear cups are extremely comfortable, with nice velour cushions that I could probably have worn for listening to an entire record maybe even two. My only gripe about the build quality would be that the headband is a bit to easily adjusted.Now for the sound quality. I ended up getting a set of Sennheiser HD 560S and spent an hour or so listening to both of them on the same album, replaying the tracks of the record over and over, first listening to the HD 599s then the HD 560S. The album I was listening to was Wishbone Ash on Deca Records, and recorded on 180 gram vinyl. I also listened to both sets with my equalizer set flat, no adjustments. I found the HD 599s to be lacking in detail, a bit muddy, not as clear over-all and somewhat muffled or toned down. The top end is not as clear and concise as I found the HD 560S set to be. The soundstage of the HD 560S headphones I found to be more complete, spacious and quite good. In short, the HD 599s lack the detail, clarity and soundstage of the HD 560S headphones; if you like a mellow, less punchy sound the HD 599s might be for you. For me I want to hear the same detail and clarity as I'm hearing with my Polk Audio Signature S60 tower speakers hooked up to my Rotel receiver. The HD 560S come pretty close to that sound, but they are slightly less comfortable, which is a bit hard to understand as the build is very similar to that of the HD599s, maybe they will loosen up some and become just as comfortable. Only Time will tell.This is my second try at headphones in the $150 price range, the first pair were the Audio-Technica ATH-M50XGM, which if found to be excellent as far as sound quality, but after a very short period made my ears hurt. So I returned them and after searching and reading reviews, decided to give the HD 599s a try.My suggestion would be to buy all three of these headphones and give them a try. In this price range the HD 560S are my choice. I'd like to keep trying more brands but, not too many out there have the oval ear cups that actually sit completely over the ears. My ears are very sensitive and become sore easily, so the oval cups are a must for me. If you can tolerate a round ear cup, try the Audio-Technica ATH-M50XGM vs the Sennheiser HD560S. Good luck in your choice and happy listening.
I recently needed to replace my pair of over the ear headphones so I began my search for a good pair of headphones in the $150-$200 range. Immediately Senhiser, Beyerdynamic, and Audio‚ÄëTechnica stood out. I first received a pair of the Audio‚ÄëTechnica ATH M-50x which had good sound but were very uncomfortable if worn for more than an hour or so. Then I picked up a pair of the Beyerdynamic DT 770. These headphones had amazing sound quality and comfort but the passive sound isolation was mediocre at best. Which is why I ordered a pair of the Beyerdynamic Premium 990 which are open back. I figured that the sound quality and comfort would be similar but the open back quality would allow me to talk with others while I played music. Unfortunately the 990's had worse sound quality than the 770 (a bit harsher sounding and not as clear) and were very uncomfortable even after only a couple of hours. During this time I also ordered a pair of Senhiser HD 599 headphones. While these headphones have a significantly different sound signature than the others I have tried, they were of similar quality. Overall the HD 599's were slightly less comfortable than the 770's but the open back quality was convenient and the sound was quite nice. I would have been satisfied with the HD 599's but they were the only pair of headphones I could not drive with my desktop. They produced terrible static. This did not occur when I used the 599's on other devices or when I used other headphones (even those with similar impedance and SPL) driven by my desktop computer. This prevented me from keeping them. I have attached a breakdown of my thoughts below:------------Sound Quality------------Beyerdynamic DT 770 (80 Ohm) - WinnerHighs - Quite good representation, much cleaner than SenhiserMids - Quite good representationLows - A little closed sounding but overall they are handled wellOverall this is how the music should sound. They perform the most similar to my pair of Martin Logan Motion 15's (bookshelf speakers)Beyerdynamic Premium 990 (32 Ohm)Highs - Similar to the 770's but rather harsh soundingMids - Nothing special, no major issuesLows - Not as powerful as the 770's but more spacious. Seemed a bit washed out due to the open back designSenhiser HD 599 (50 Ohm) - Close 2nd BestHighs - Not quite as poppy as they should be. They are a bit muted in the sound signature which can make them less fatiguing than other, more analytical, headphones.Mids - A bit to high level for me, it tended to make punk rock music sound very close and muddiedLows - A bit boomy but very spaciousAudio Technica ATH M-50xHighs - Quite good representation, a bit cold thoughMids - Nothing special, no major issues thoughLows - Too over-emphasized-----------------Comfort---------------Beyerdynamic DT 770 - WinnerPerfect. I wore these on multiple occasions for more than 7 hours and never noticed any pressure points or discomfort. The headband is larger than average to distribute the pressure. The clamp pressure is also a bit more than average but this was not an issue due to the soft, replaceable, ear pads.Beyerdynamic Premium 990I could not wear these for more than a few hours. The headband is made of a much harder material than the 770's and causes a painful pressure point on the top of my head. I believe this is made worse by the lower clamping force since more of the weight is on the top of your head.Senhiser HD 599I could wear these for several hours as long as I moved them around every 30-40 minutes. More comfortable than the 990's. Significantly less clamping force than the 770's.Audio Technica ATH M-50xThese were the least comfortable. I could only stand to wear them for an hour or so before I had to take them off. All of the discomfort came from the top of my head.----------------Usability---------------Beyerdynamic DT 770These come with a permanently attached 10ft cable. That was a lot of cable to get in my pocket every time I got up from my desk. The cable also has more insulation making it much thicker and stiffer than average.Beyerdynamic DT 990These come with a permanently attached 10ft cable. That was a lot of cable to get in my pocket every time I got up from my desk. The cable also has more insulation making it much thicker and stiffer than average. The open back design was also a plus for me since I work in a semi-quiet office environment and I could still hold a conversation with someone while listening to music. But I could not hear others quite as well as I could with the HD 599's.Senhiser HD 599The interchange-able cables with different lengths worked perfect for home listening as well as on the go. The cable is also thinner and more flexible than the Beyerdynamic cable. The open back design was also a plus for me since I work in a semi-quiet office environment and I could still hold a conversation with someone while listening to music. The only downfall is the issue I had with compatibility between some devices and this pair of headphones where I would hear static or computer noise when driving them with a computer.Audio Technica ATH M-50xI really love the long coiled cable that came with these. To me this is the best option since I dont have to lug around a long cable or risk losing extra cables. With that being said, it also came with a ~ 9ft straight cable and 3ft straight cable if the coiled cable is too much for you.
I've owned these for a couple of years now - bought on the last black friday on sale for around $100, based on reviews.  I knew they would go on sale, because these are the Amazon Special Edition, and they historically go on sale every black friday and every amazon day.  These are the best headphones I've ever owned, and I've owned headphones that cost double what I paid for these.  Open-back, wide soundstage, great for gaming.  The only negative I can think of is that they aren't wireless, but that's a small price to pay for the quality they give.  I have large ears and wear glasses and they comfortably fit over them.  Highest praise.  If you're hesitating just buy them, check reviews on YT and you can always return them if you don't like them.  But I'm betting you will.

I have purchased these before, but this most recent time the sound quality is drastically worse than any other time I have purchased them. I had an older set of this exact brand/type (also purchased via Amazon) that was wearing out and compared it against the new pair I just bought. The old, glitching set sounded much better than the new one, which was very tinny and soft. I'm incredibly disappointed in the decrease in quality.
Compr√© este segundo par para m√≠ hijo, para que los use para viajar y los primeros para clases virtuales. Son muy duraderos.
These ear buds barely stay in place. The foam on one of them was not on the bud but I put it there. A few minutes later it fell off again.  The sound quality is no good. I'm not expecting hi-fidelity but even for just watching sports or shows they're no good. I was looking to replace the ear buds that came with my Samsung Galaxy phone. I will try to find Samsung ear buds.
I use these to go jogging and they get tossed around alot without ever seeming to become damaged. Great price for a great product.
When the product came apart and an attempt was made to try to pop it back together, it broke completely. Is there a way to get a free replacement?Please advise.
Earbuds are really a personal preference item. Some that other people love you might hate those, but for me and my son these are great. I like to wear them and just get to work so I do not want earbuds that come out super easy. These you rotate when you put them in and they move into place and that makes them stay in better.  They are not squishy like some brands and if you want that these are not for you.
Love price n product
They took longer than expected to come and are made of cheap quality one headphone already messed up would not recommend
My old ones were going bad. I'm glad I found same one like my old ones.
Huge ear pieces even for adults.

I bought these headphones to replace the original Wireless crushers I bought a few years back. These headphones are the most base intensive headphones I've ever owned. One review I saw compared the base from these headphones and compared them to being kicked in the head by a mule, he was not wrong. The packaging is understated and well thought out the headphones come with a hard shell case usb-c charging cable headphone jack cable and the headphones themselves. The fit and finish of this unit is impressive. I bought the black headphones and they are understated slick and look very nice. While these headphones are heavy they are not prohibitively so. The clamp Force on my head is nice I do not worry about these headphones falling off as I do yard work or work out. The noise canceling is decent. While they are not as active as the Bose qc2 these headphones block out a lot of the Ambient sound. With sound canceling on I do not feel like I'm in a tunnel or have the pressure effect often associated with active noise canceling. My listing environment is noisy as my house is on a busy road and my Aquarium produces a fair bit of sound. The filter noise from my aquarium is all but locked out however I can still hear dripping sounds from the filters. In addition when the ANC is on there is an audible hiss similar to a cassette tape. This hiss is not noticeable when sound from music or other media is played back through this headset. I do not find the hiss annoying but it is sad that Skullcandy couldn't work around this issue.The first thing I did after opening the package was turn on the headphones and paired them with my tablet. Pairing mode is very simple and quick and I had no problems with playback. I opened up YouTube and played a song by the Black Eyed Peas with the bass turned all the way up. Let me tell you that was an experience. After listening to the song I played around with the base slider and found that songs that already have a lot of bass don't need a lot of help from these headphones and I turn the base slider down near to the bottom. Songs however that don't have a lot of bass I was able to have the slider up much higher and found it to be a very enjoyable experience. I played Pachelbel's Canon in D with piano and cello and found with the base turned up I was able to hear the low notes on the piano and found that it sounded like a live performance what I mean is the haptic base vibrations made the piano feel as if it was in the room with me. I then listened to a few tracks that I really like from Mannheim Steamroller and Kurt bester playing with with the bass slider to find the best sound environment. Listening to music with these headphones is dynamic and Rich and I found myself becoming emotional while listening to favorite tracks. Other reviews complain about the mids and the highs not being reproduced well however I prefer these headphones to my Bose qc2 for music. The reason being I can adjust exactly how much bass I want in my music. While there is an app that helps the user customize their listening preferences I found I did not need to do so. While the Bass on these headphones is haptic meaning there is a mechanical vibration that activates with low frequencies the effect is like having a subwoofer moving air in the listening environment. The haptic Bass as well as the low register from the earphones themselves makes music come alive. Most people are saying that this headset is only for bass heads, but those people are missing the point of this headphone. Sure the user can turn the bass up all the way and make their teeth rattle and it's kind of fun to do that once in awhile, the reality is this headset allows the user to customize their listening preferences in a way that is unavailable from any other headset. I find the reproductions of the high and the mid-range to be decent bright and clear and with the bass slider I can customize and have full control of exactly how much Bass I want while listening to music.I recorded this review using the microphone on the headphones. I found that my voice sounded natural and not muted as one would expect from ANC monitor headphones. Having the microphone built in is a nice touch. I think these would be great for playing games even though there is not a boom mike like most gaming headphones this shows a boom mic is not necessary when playing games. This partly justifies the price of this headset as it can be used for gaming phone calls and for listening to music. Additionally this headset comes with the tile feature built in. If you are worried about losing your headphones or leaving them at the coffee shop or not being able to locate them which was the case for my original crushers and necessitated the replacement, the tile feature will help you locate where your headphones are and works very well.While this headset is not for everyone I find it is quickly becoming my go-to headset. The only downside is this headset went on sale the day after I ordered it. I did contact Amazon only to find that they no longer guarantee lowest price and I was out of luck. This is not acceptable when one considers the price of Amazon Prime and soured the experience when buying these headphones.In conclusion I would recommend these headphones for anyone who wants an immersive sound experience. Not only is the build quality the fit and finish and feel of these headphones impressive, they're also feature rich with app support and support for the tile feature built in this is a good choice for those who use headphones and are looking for an immersive experience.
I thought I'd gotten a defective pair.  The bass boost wasn't working at all.  Turns out - they were just too low on charge and once I'd left them charging overnight - they worked fine.  They sound downright amazing when you get that bass boost dialed in.  It's got so much that about somewhere in the 1/2 range is about right - anything more and it just ruins the music.
Can't charge while using an audio jack. It will charge while using it for blue tooth mode. While using for Bluetooth mode the volume isn't as loud as it is for audio jack mode. Sound quality is good for both models. If you want to use with a PC and be able to charge at the same time have to buy a blue tooth USB device. The headphones are comfy and have plenty of room for the ears to fit inside. I set the bass near the lowest settings. Turning it up further creates unatural pulsing on the ears. Volume increases or decreases are in 10 percent increments. Its not gradual as turning up the dial on a set of computer speakers.
Had them for a while now, use them for lifting. When I got them the earphone part was loose. The bass is crazy and sound is good. I‚Äôve charged them twice sense I‚Äôve got them and I‚Äôve had them for around 2 months.
I loved the headphones great extreme bass but Amazon did a horrible job at delivering this product it was raining and they left it right outside in the rain and I had a mailbox which can fit in but luckily me I was able to get it in time before it got very wet and damaged my headphones
Love EDM?! Body vibrating BASS?! Want to feeeeel the music? These headphones are made for you! The haptic bass is really something else, nothing like it outside of these headphones. Even the Skullcandy Crusher Evo's don't get as bassy - I know, I tried both side by side for days. I also bought and tested the Sony WM-1000XM4. Here are my thoughts of all 3 models:Skullcandy Crusher ANC:Pros- Deeper, most powerful bass of all. Haptic bass knob is awesome, your head will be vibrating HARD.- Excellent music quality across highs, mids, lows.- Most comfortable. Love the plush top band. For smaller heads, fits great!- Call quality is excellent. Tested with my husband and he said it sounded like I was there.- Deep red color is SO COOL.- $199 price-point is way more affordable than Sony WM-1000XM4. Only $50 more than Evo for better bass and more comfort.Cons- ANC causes a hum, even when ANC is off, so listening to podcasts or acoustic music is meh.- ANC is kind of weak. Works better for noises like airplanes vs human voices.- The adjustable headband is not as tight as the Evo, it opens up a bit when you hold from the top. But it doesn't affect anything once you put on the headphones.Skullcandy Crusher Evo:Pros- Tight build, variety of colors. Light grey was really slick, a bit more grey than the images show on Amazon.- Very good sound overall for the $149 price. Bass was solid. No humming when music is off.- Longer battery life than both other models, but no ANC at all.Cons:- Headband padding is plastic and SUPER UNCOMFORTABLE. Gave me a headache after just a few minutes.- Haptic bass is nowhere as broad in range as the ANC. At 100%, it was where ANC is at 25%. To me, I wanted more vibration and bass with many songs. But, I'm a total bass-head.Sony WM-1000XM4:Pros- Best-in-class ANC. Blocks out a lot of external noises.- Good quality, well-rounded sound. 360-degree sound was fancy.- Nice build, cool touch-based controls vs the Skullcandy's physical buttons.Cons- Bass is NOT IMPRESSIVE. This is not for Bassheads. It is more about balanced sound, even at 100% bass in EQ, there was almost no vibration.- NOT for smaller heads. I'm a 5'3 woman, my husband has a smaller head for a guy too. It didn't fit either of us! That alone was a deal-breaker.- Super pricey - $350!! That's $150 more than the Skullcandy ANC, if ANC is your only priority then OK, fine, get the Sonys. But be OK with a very meh bass.To sum it all up:The Evo and ANC Skullcandy Crushers are both awesome for Bass, but for $50 more with the ANCs you get way more comfort and way more haptic bass. The buzzing on the ANCs is the only real negative I found, oh well... The Evo's headband is so hard and plastic-ee I couldn't stand it.The Sony wm-1000xm4 didn't have a stand-out bass. No haptic vibrations. And they were huge, too large for my head. ANC was epic, but that's not my end goal, I want out of this world bass, comfort, and great phone call quality.Skullcandy Crusher ANC checked the most boxes for me, the Bass is INSANE, you'll LOVE IT if you're into Electronic music, Hip Hop, even Hard Rock. Microphone is amazing for calls too. ANC is kind of weak, but its not my priority so oh well, it works so-so. These headphones are fun, comfy, stylish and did I mention DAT BASS?!?! :D
First time I put these headphones on, I felt like I could feel the music and bass in a way I‚Äôve only dreamt of. These headphones are like a whole body/brain hug. Bass and electronic music of all sorts are SO awesome coming through these headphones, for any EDM fans these are a must!
I love the bass and the little slider for adjusting the bass. The noise cancelation on and off being a simple tap on one side is also awesome. I will say that the size adjustment part feels just a little loose and the headphone can get a tad hot. But I love them.
I freaking love these headphones. The sound is amazing, battery life is crazy long, super comfy. I can't say enough good about these headphones. Just buy them. Worth the extra money for superior headphones
One of the more uncomfortable headphones that I own but still the best sounding the customization is what really sells me on these honestly have a hard time wanting to use other onesI own a pair of Bose skullcandy crushers and Cohens I will compare these individually and I will be making sure than I explain myself as well as I can without wasting your timeI wanna start off by saying the noise cancellation is on par with the Bose which I would say is the best sometimes I felt completely deaf The battery life is I think probably less than advertise but still plenty you can‚Äôt really go to days without charging it but you can come close which the other ones I‚Äôve mentioned do about the same I wouldn‚Äôt seen that they falsely advertise them on ours I just say that on average I think these kind of headphones really don‚Äôt last more than a day if you‚Äôre actually using them a lot like I do now about sound quality that one‚Äôs going to take me when I feel like the rest of my life to explain to people the best way I know how to put it is it‚Äôs beneath bows and Skullcandy in different ways But possibly still above Cohen which Cohen is still not bad the Cohens I would say feel like budget ones you can buy them for about 100 bucks I bought these on sale for 140 I bought the post on sale for 180 and I bought the Skullcandy for closer to about 200 the Bose I have are a iteration that was used for gaming and is an all-around amazing headset both in how it fits how light it is it goes all the way around the ear. doesn‚Äôt feel too big not too tight and probably the single most comfortable headphones out there. the sound is as wide and rich as you could imagine it‚Äôs pretty much perfect but it has zero customizability which is sort of frustrating the Skullcandy crushers that I have are actually The Skullcandy crusher ANC which is the highest ranking Skullcandy headphones I‚Äôd say with the base slider all the way down they match the sound of the Bose but the headphones themselves don‚Äôt.they are not completely comfortable might be one of the more uncomfortable headphones that I own right behind it I would say that these razor headphones are actually closer to the skullcandy in terms of uncomfortability just because of how oddly tight that they are... not very light either The Cohen are actually surprisingly the closest to the bose in terms of comfortability but when it comes to gaming use I‚Äôd say they all fit just fine and that the the razors come close to first right behind Skullcandy my reasonings for this is because the 3-D ability of really telling you where things are in a video game  is fascinatingly well done the skullcandy  have a better range of sound like that of the Bose while also giving the user the ability to decide how much base they want which is actually what makes them in my opinion the coolest ones. razor is right behind those with less customizability being there no base slider.

This is the third "Beats Headset" in our household. The other two are still in use, just by other members of the family. (each prior generation gets passed down/etc).But I had been using a pair of generic padded headphones while my wife was using the Beats Solo2 and recently upgraded to the Beats Solo3. I found them to be comfortable, but wanted larger ear cups since I didn't like pressure on my ears too much. So when Prime Day rolled around, I picked up a pair of these on sale. Nice.So, my impressions:Package: top notch. Typical Apple minimalism, fit and finish. The only thing I would nit pick is that the headphones were collapsed inside of the egg shaped hardshell, so one of the ear pads had dented a bit due to being constantly pressed against the inside of the arch. Not a problem, but just a nit pick.Comfort: the ear pads were not large enough to completely encompass my ears. However, they are more comfortable, for me, vs the Solo3. So definitely a plus if your head/ears are a bit bigger. This will help.Setup: Turn it on by holding down the power button... place near an Apple device, and it shows up. Accept the pairing and you're good to go. It was painless and worked just like with the AirPods.Sound quality: After having spent a good deal of time exposed to high frequency sounds(data centers) I think that I'm not a good judge of "awesome sound reproduction". The padded cups and the tweaking that Apple/Beats did definitely causes the output of the headphones to favor the lower end of the audio spectrum. So things of a strong deep thump nature will definitely be felt. The higher frequency sounds sounded alright for several of the pieces I played. The mids feels a bit muddied, but that could be due to either the heavy bass-leaning configuration or the dampening effect of the headset and the ANR.Ambient Noise Reduction: so I didn't know this, but each time you turn these on, the noise reduction is turned on by default. I had the headsets on for a while with no music playing, and wondered how to turn it on, when I read that it starts by default. You can disable it after powering it up with a double push of the power button or from the bluetooth device info screen on your IOS device. When this happens, there is a beep/tone to indicate a state change, a momentary dip in audio output from the internal change, and then all of a sudden, I heard a humming sound. I thought they were defective and then realized that it was the sound of the HVAC in the room. .... I had never even noticed it. I spent a few minutes walking around the room and seeing how it worked, turning it on and off again. Basically, it seems like it measures and figures out the frequencies of the surroundings and then counters those frequencies. There IS a noticeable drop. Box fan in one room... can definitely hear it. Turn on ANC and then it dips down to a very very quiet repeating whoosh whoosh. The music when played like this feels more like music being listened to in a quieter room. It's definitely not just white noise.Heat: I can see how the design might result in sweaty ears. :) And I don't see myself running/jogging with these. But then again, they aren't Beats Jugging Headphones. They are studio headphones. So I'll leave the running music activities to my Air Pods... and let's face it, if I'm out on the sidewalk/etc, I WANT to be aware of my surroundings.All in all, I really like them. I went with matte black mainly because it was nice and plain.Update: after a week of use, really liking this headset. I can get about three nights if sleep use out of it before needing to recharge. I think that for people who are sensitive to noise when they sleep, the ANC is great for giving you that ‚Äúquiet room‚Äù experience. If you want to play a little very quiet music or white noise over the ANC, that works too. Really cool.Love not having to deal with a cord when I‚Äôm listening to music and working at my computer.Haven‚Äôt used the headset mode more than a few times, but seems okay.
Super fast shipping order yesterday got them today best quality and sounds awesome.!! Expensive but worth it.!! Once put them on couldn‚Äôt hear No outside noise just all music.!! Love them .!!
To tell you the truth I miss the wired beats headset I had purchased about 4 years 5 years ago?I've had 3 pairs of beats headsets now the 1st one was terrific and even the 2nd 1 the studio to wired headset was pretty outstanding! This 3rd pair however is a bit differentI love beets music headsets! They are terrific they fit really well and are a great value for the money and how long they last and the sound quality but this particular set ... Maybe it's just my Headset but there's something off about the sound.Their noise canceling is good the base is terrific but it's kind of missing the mid... Maybe a little more Treble?Something odd too that I wouldn't have expected is that the battery now has to be charged twice A-day instead of once and they can understand that because it's not plugged into the phone like my other headset was so as not draining off the battery but keeping the Bluetooth connection on seems to drain the battery faster and I don't understand that at all as it's just not something you'd expect to be a drain on the battery.Beats is always put out a very high quality product but since Apple purchased it...  It seems it's made a little cheaper and quality than the last 2 pairs  I have hadThe headband feels a little more flexible and that troubles me because I don't want to see these things break. The only time any of the ones I had broke was the 1st pair that's because I was pulling it out of my kid's hand he was 19 or 20 at the time.I'm hoping it's a better made product increasing in its quality versus Apple cutting corners and causing problems where there were noneI find it very sad that doctor Dre gave up this company for the money I can't imagine any other reason someone would sell such a quality company with a great brand and outstanding products when the company it was sold to cares very little about the quality of Music itself. Sure they sell music online but they're not musicians! I used to be. The quality of the sound really matters to me which is why I bought these in the 1st place.  Beats music also had the number one online music source in my opinion but as soon as doctor Dre left it it went downhill and then sold outSo I can say that these are really great headphones and I still haven't heard any others that are as good as these but in fact have tried many others trying them in this store and the sound didn't come close to the quality of beats music. Honestly not even close. If I needed a pair of headphones and didn't have the money for these I would save as long as I had to to buy a pair of these instead of just settling on something else because I would not enjoy the experience as much as I do with this headset. Should I say this brand?All in all it is an expensive purchase. Seeing that it's expensive you have to decide for yourself whether hearing music as it was meant to be heard as important to you. It is to me. It's an investment in your entertainment and it's so worth while one.I cannot recommend this headset any higher but to say if you can find the beats music studio to version in new condition which would be very rare indeed. The ones that are wired meaning it would connect from the headset to your phone I would suggest that pair over these.These are a great 2nd to that 1.
If you are thinking about buying these just do it you won‚Äôt regret it. It will be the best decision I‚Äôve ever made I promise! The noise cancellation is crazy, I walk around with these headphones while listening to what I‚Äôm listening to and I literally can‚Äôt hear a single thing! I absolutely love that I am in my own world with these headphones on the audio quality is immaculate. I just love everything about them especially going to the gym with them!
Let me start by saying that I am not an audiophile and this is an honest review from someone who needs a reliable pair of headphones for a range of day-to-day activities, which happens to include listening to music. Prior to purchasing the Studio3 headphones, I was using Apples own AirPods (v1). To replace them as a daily driver, I needed three things from a pair of headphones:1). Better sound quality, and ANC (active noise canceling);2). Better Bluetooth connectivity in an area where my MacBook and Mac Mini are surrounded by metal (introducing some interference);3). Faster connection and easier swapping between devices (MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV)SOUND QUALITYI listen to a wide range of music--from rap to rock to nature sounds; as a part of my job, I'm in and out of video chats (hangouts, meet, etc). Overall, the Studio3 headphones work as expected regardless of what I'm using them for and the microphone is clear.The sound quality of the Studio3 headphones, however, is not noticeably better or worse than headphones I've used at lower price points. If you can catch a deal on the Studio3 as I did, it makes the price point a little more tolerable. At nearly $350 at the time of this review, sound quality should not be the main reason you purchase them if your use case is the same or similar to mine.BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITYThis is really where the Studio3 headphones shine! In comparison to AirPods and similar Bluetooth devices, Apples W1 chip is amazing and keeps you connected. With my existing setup, my Mac Mini is in a server rack made of solid steel and despite every other Bluetooth device dropping less than 10ft (3.05 m) away, thanks to the W1 chip, the Studio3 remain connected even with walls between the headset and the Mac Mini. I was able to roam about 25ft (7.62 m) to 30ft (9.14 m) before they started to drop.DEVICE SWAPPINGWhile this is likely due to the ecosystem (Apple), the Studio3 pair near instantly with any device I've tested. While paired to my Mac Mini, I can quickly pair to my Apple TV, iPad, or iPhone in seconds. For comparison, the AirPods are quick, though seem to get "confused" in a way that prevents them from being able to do the same at the same speed.CHARGE / CHARGINGThe Studio3 headphones easily get me through an entire day of work and then some on a single charge, with ANC enabled. I'm a bit disappointed to see that despite Apple moving to USB-C on the MacBook, Mac Mini, and the newest iPad, the Studio3 still uses USB-A to micro USB. USB-C should be the standard on a $350+ device. Unless you have an adapter (USB-A => USB-C), you'll need another charger to charge the headphones. This is a burden honestly as it adds to what I need to carry.OVERALLThe Studio3 headphones get a pretty solid 4 stars. What really prevents them from being 5-Star, in my opinion, boils down to two things:1). Use of micro USB instead of USB-C, and;2). The ear pads are not leatherFor what I need them to do, they work extremely well and beat out AirPods in every way imaginable. Yes, in comparison to AirPods, they are bulkier, though it's a small price to pay for something that works better.
These are very good headphones. I find their noise cancellation very effective. And the sound quality is robust. I got them to help ease long plane flights, and was quite happy with the decision. Really good to have on if you should find yourself at Manchester Oxford Road Station at rush hour.Note that for air travel, you'll want to bring their plug-in audio cable with you, if you're going to listen to the in-flight entertainment system.The cons: they do start feeling a little tight on my head after a while (I have a large hat size), and this makes it a little harder to just turn the music on and fall asleep. And if you're wearing glasses with them on, I would advice having ones with plastic frames (metal ones cut into the cover of the earpieces a bit.Still, the quality/value matrix is quite good for these.
best headphones out there. If you want a real sound experience, this is worth the price!
My son has been asking for these beats for years.  Finally decided his 18th bday was the right time.  He has them on constantly says sound it's unbelievable
***Update December 29th 2017***.I am reducing my rating the three stars not because there's anything wrong with these headphones, but because I listen to the Sony WH-100XM2 headphones and quite honestly those are breathtaking. And for the money I am wanted to be blown away by a pair of headphones that cost this much. After listening to my wife's cheap $30 Sony headphones from Walmart I realize that these beats that I bought sounded just about as good which was disappointing. So it's really all about reference. The Sony's that I just mentioned above alright night and day difference and quite frankly the wow factor I was looking for. Absolutely everything that the Beats can do till Sony's can do probably 10 times better. Sound quality is so good I can't really describe it. Noise cancelling is definitely even better and all the different options that you can do with the Sony makes it worth the cost. So I returned the Beat Studio 3. I felt people should know that if they're going to spend this much on headphones you should definitely listen to the Sony's.I ordered my Beats Studio 3 wireless headphones a week ago. First thing to know...anyone writing about how bad they are durability wise and dated before September 4th of 2017 are fake or an older model is being mistakenly referred to. September 4th of 2017 are when these studio series 3 came out. People talking about how they can't hold up for over a year couldn't have possibly owned a pair for that long. Keep that in mind. But I will say at this point is, I listened to these with a variety of music so far and they sound incredible. Seems like the way these are tuned, you have to turn them up a little bit (volume to "medium") to get the best sound. When they're very quiet it just doesn't seem like the Fidelity is quite as good as when they're turned up a little bit more. Of course that last statement is very subjective. I listened to Bose at a Target about a day before and those sounded very good as well. I can't truly tell which one sounds better unless I had them both in front of me and both playing the exact same song from the same source and switch back and forth to really hear it. But I will say from my reference, these sound pretty much the same in terms of sound quality. As far as noise cancelling goes, anything that has a constant sound in the background such as fans, refrigerators running or someone mowing the grass outside etc. pretty much anything that's a constant sound, as soon as you turn on the noise cancelling, those sounds are completely killed. Cannot hear them at all. You can continue to hear people talking and you can hear sounds happening on the TV if it's loud enough but all of that (random sounds) are greatly muffled. Keep in mind that noise cancelling does not work well on sounds that are random. That goes for any brand. There is no doubt however that the noise cancelling is working and working well.I can't say again whether or not bose is better. When I tried them out in the store at Target, the bose sounded about the same... all background sounds completely killed and I was able to hear people talking to me although they sounded distant/much quieter and with a greatly reduced bass in their voice (bose/beats about the same).Also I'm not an apple Fanboy type either. I do not own an iPhone, I have a Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus. Pairing these with my Samsung was pretty straightforward, hold the button for 5 seconds make sure your Bluetooth is on and phone picked them up. Next time you turn on the Beats, make sure you have your Bluetooth turned on first and they automatically connect.One last thing, when it comes to comfort, anyone saying that these things hurt their head hurt their ears or grip too tight, must have their head made out of paper mache or tissue paper. These are some incredibly comfortable headphones and I could wear them indefinitely without any problem whatsoever.
Beats STUDIO  covers the ear Beats SOLO  sits on top of the ear both are excellent sound but I prefer Studio because they cover my ear instead of pressing down on my ear after a while with my beats SOLO pressing down it hurts my ear so I‚Äôm a Beats studio fan NOW

I've only been using this headset for a couple days so far but I really like it!  I am quadriplegic and I control my laptop almost exclusively via Windows Speech Recognition so my biggest concern before I bought this headset was its accuracy with that program.  And of course, I couldn't find any reviews with any information regarding how it worked with the program.  I read and watched some reviews and I heard mixed and contradicting opinions regarding the microphone and its quality, the microphone is really good, Windows Speech Recognition understands every command very clearly and the dictation and speech to text types everything I say perfectly spot on, I believe it's even more accurate than the wired headset that I've been using forever.  I should have bought this headset a long time ago!  The sound is really good, I think I was just expecting a little more bass.  The headset is also very comfortable and stays in place extremely well, at least for me.  And battery life is excellent!  I would highly recommend this headset!
I‚Äôm happy with this headset and it has been working well for more than two years.  Not too happy though with the materials on the ear cushion, you can see in the image that they are peeling.  Jabra sells replacements with a minimum order quantity of ten cushions.  Why, why, why, do that for the only thing that is likely to need replacement for the life of the device?  Disappointing.  They should sell them quantity two, not quantity ten.  I suppose the materials that are peeling could use some improvement, but two years is a good run so I won‚Äôt quibble.
Easily the best Headphones I've ever owned. They are very light, the sound quality is amazing and the noise cancelling feature works well while on conference calls. You can mute a call by lifting the microphone stalk and battery life is extremely good. I bought this set for my daughter as she stole mine for gaming and I wanted them back ! :)
Got this product since I take inbound calls. After years of suffering with a tethered cord headset and work refusing to upgrade to a wireless one, I took a chance on this headset and I am so glad I did! I got the single-ear model and I love it! The sound is so much better than my work-approved headset!
My wife uses these for her company.  I'm quoting her "they are ok".  Seems like a lot of money for what they are, but the company recommends and pays for them.  A set of hyperX gaming headphones for half the price would probably sound better

5 STARs for each classification, quality sound and comfort... well worth the $50.00
I love these. At first just used normal mode bit since I tried noise canceling mode I have used it ever since. Works so well my roommates watch TV and I can have my headphones on streaming on my laptop and can't hear the TV. Also love how the part that extends has extra reinforcement. Several headphones I had before that was the weak spot.
good for the money. Go ahead and spend more if you need better then average.
The packaging comes with a free extended warranty. But don‚Äôt plan on signing up for it and getting that extended warranty unless you have bought from either Google shopping or the Cowin website. Sure, that‚Äôs a freebie if you do, but don‚Äôt send me the cute cards and tons of paper if I can‚Äôt take advantage of what you‚Äôre giving.
Los uso para entrenar y me fascinannn, normalmente yo no uso de este tipo de aud√≠fonos por que tienden a ser muy inc√≥modos para mi o apretar bastante en la cabeza pero ESTOS SON INCRE√çBLES Y C√ìMODOS definitivamente comprar√≠a de estos mismos de nuevo, incluso pedir√© unos para mi hermana.
The ONLY reason I purchased the new black pair is BC as you can see...the white plastic covering the foam flacked off. Wearing outdoors was embarrassing! LolI used alcohol on them A LOT which was most likely the reason for the flacking.I've owned the white pair for 3 years. I have nothing negative to comment on, seriously! The battery life works well over 7-8 hours.Having a backup is nice. üòä
Despu√©s de un tiempo de uso las orejas duelen porque aprieta mucho y no se puede regular
I bought these for my girlfriend. They work great. Now she doesn‚Äôt hear anything I say which has reduced our arguments by 50%.
My son does better with headphones over the ear instead of the ear buds. Thank you.
They have good external noise cancelation.

My son loves them
Honestly,  for the cost.... They're awesome!The sound quality is ideal, they're not too heavy on, and the charge lasts forever.The Bluetooth pairing is fast and simple- with options to answer phone while paired up.I've only used to excersize, which it's great for me!with phone in pocket and headphones on head, you should have no problem with a connection.
Bought two pair for my kids.  They seem rugged but their battery only lasts about 8 hours.
Liked the bass
So these are good headphones üéß  they are good sounding but were pretty uncomfortable but I added foam from my other broken headset and now it is really good üëç
I like these headphones.  They have good sound quality, but I would like a little more bass. They are comfortable and easy to adjust.
Fits to tight. First one I bought came broken. Had to have it replaced.But would work great for kids. But squeezes my head as an adult.
Honestly these are amazing! Kinda tight so keep that in mind, tight just means it‚Äôs adjustable n it holds close to your head. I‚Äôm not sure that they are waterproof but I use them to work out. THESE ARE SUCH A GREAT BUY in my opinion ofc
These headphones are great, they last a long time and they are very comfortable. The sound quality is great, and it's great for when you want to do something like listen to music.
I wasn‚Äôt expecting much since they only cost about $24, and I had never heard of the company.I took the headphones out of the box, put them over my ears and pressed the ‚Äòon‚Äô button. They powered on and instantly went into pairing mode. The moment I accepted the new headphones, they paired instantly with my iPhone, that was the first welcome surprise. The 2nd happy surprise was the sound quality, I did not expect to hear such a high quality, crisp sound, way better than my old pair.  The range is very good too.I just got these today, but so far I‚Äôm very impressed with these headphones and would recommend them. They come with a nice small carry bag too.

Updated on October 7th, 2022:These still are the best sounding headphones I‚Äôve owned and I have several different brands ranging from $100 to as much as $4,000. These are my go to headphones for everyday use and they sound as good now as they did when I bought them. The reason why the back stitching looks a little off is it‚Äôs how they are designed to sit properly on your ears. These are still in incredible shape and none of the issues that other people are complaining about. The only thing I wish is that the ear cups were a little larger. I have big ears, but it‚Äôs not a deal breaker. Best set of sub $1,000 headphones for the price. These are also a available in a grey and red color scheme, but I would think that they are just as good as these. Now using a Astell&Kern Max player that does a much higher resolution than my and still the best sounding headphones I have ever bought for my portable devices. I upgraded my cable with a much better made cable that‚Äôs longer and fits these perfectly. Got these at the end April of 2021 and have bought several other headphones for home and potable DAPs, but these are incredible sounding especially with the range that they cover from the lows to mids and highs. It‚Äôs unbelievable that these are not a lot more money for the sound quality and how long they have lasted. No problem with damage to the ear pads or anything. They are very lightweight and I would put them up against several other higher priced brands for sound quality and durability.Update on November 4th 2021:I have been using these headphones everyday since buying them, which was 6 months ago and I am completely surprised at how good they sound with my Astell & Kern Kann Alpha player and how much more detail these produce compared to several pairs of much more expensive headphones and earbuds that I own. I have not had any issues with the ear pads falling apart or losing the imitation leather covering and these are my go to headphones as they playback Tidal MQA files and my physical MQA Japanese CDs much richer than I thought they would. After a couple of weeks of using these, they really made my High Resolution files sound better than they ever have in the past. I purchased a new and upgraded headphone cable from New Fantasia , here on Amazon, and it‚Äôs longer than the original 4.4mm input cable by more than 2 foot. These sound even better now with the cable upgrade. I have to say that without a doubt, these are the best sounding headphones that I‚Äôve ever heard that are under the $1,000 price tag. That‚Äôs saying a lot as I own several different headphones and earbuds. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend these to anyone else who is looking for quality MQA sound with either Tidal or DSD files. I‚Äôm still going to try Amazon‚Äôs High Resolution music service soon. I didn‚Äôt think that I would use these as much as I have when I first purchased them. They were basically a fluke as they had both the 5 pole 4.4mm Pentacon input and Hi Res certification at a good price in order to test my new DAP. This purchase turned out to be a great deal as these are the best bang for the buck for High Resolution certified headphones! The link for the replacement headphone cable is in the question section for these. You can also just search for A2DC headphone replacement cables and you will find a few different versions for other Audio Technica models as well.  My only issue with these, and it‚Äôs not worth loosing a star over is that they are more ‚Äúon the ear‚Äù than over the ear for me personally. They fit like my Grado Statement series, but it‚Äôs not affecting how incredible these sound. I added a photo with my player and the new and longer New Fantasia cable attached. It‚Äôs 6.6 feet long. But it‚Äôs perfect as this connection is kind of hard to get an aftermarket set of cables for. So for six months, these have been my preferred headphonesApril 30, 2021I originally purchased these because my Astell&Kern Kann Alpha I had just purchased from World Wide Stereo, an Amazon seller,  started acting up when you tried to use the 4.4mm Headphone Jack. I had bought a custom made Kimber Kable from another source for my Shure 846 earbuds and when it arrived I immediately started having issues with the sound dropping on the right channel. I bought these primarily to test my connection and to eliminate the upgraded cable as the problem. These were a good deal and they came with an assortment of cable terminations. One was the 4.4 TRRRS input that is becoming more popular and identical to my new Kimber Kable. After I got these, the right channel was still dropping sound, so it had to be the player.I had purchased the player from a Certified seller and it was open box. I generally avoid open box items like the plague, as I have had issues with them in the past. The only open box items I‚Äôve purchased that have been great deals where at a Vinyl Convention in Austin a few years ago. The dealer was incredible about letting me exchange the open box player for a brand new one. They even split the price difference with me and they had their techs look into the issue. It was indeed the player. I have received my new one and I‚Äôm still using these headphones as my Shure earbuds don‚Äôt sound the best of all of my different headphones and earbuds and I can‚Äôt wear them as long as headphones. They have a tendency to make my ears sore after awhile.I have to say that these sound even better than my Focal closed back Elegia headphones that I am waiting on a custom cord to arrive for as well. I listen to my player when my husband is watching TV and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm not interested in watching. So I use closed back headphones to keep sound in and out.  I have a set of Focal Clear headphones that I can‚Äôt use, except in my listening room where my main audio setup is located as he can hear too much noise from the open back design. The Clear Headphones sound far better than the Utopia headphones and I returned them. It was the first generation model, so I don‚Äôt know about the newer ones, but they cost twice what I paid for the Focal Utopia‚Äôs. My favorite all time headphones are my Beyerdynamic first generation Tesla‚Äôs. They sound great and are extremely comfortable to wear. But these are designed more for High End Receivers and not for portable devices. They have too high of an oHm rating for my Astell & Kern devices.I thought I might pass these to a friend or family member, but I will keep these as they are really good sounding. Every set of headphones and earbuds I own have unique sound qualities about them that makes them sound very pleasing. I can adjust the bass on the player if I don‚Äôt have enough as well as eliminate highs and minds that are to loud. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about them is that they are more like on the ear headphones and not over the ear. They fit better than my Grado headphones but not as nicely as my Beyerdynamic Tesla‚Äôs. That‚Äôs actually the only issue I have with these.The second issue is that they feel very fragile. I have noticed I have been using them more often as they are better matched with the ohm output of the Astell&Kern player than the Focal Clear headphones. I don‚Äôt want to use the onboard amp as I think that‚Äôs what was the demise of my Astell&Kern Kann original player. It would get so hot, it would burn your finger. It‚Äôs not even turning on now. I had to pay almost $400 to have it repaired once already and know it is completely dead. So it‚Äôs not getting fixed again.  I had four players by Astell&Kern and the AK100 was my first one. It still sounds great with 24bit/192kHz files. Works like it did from day one. It just doesn‚Äôt play Tidal or supports my MQA CDs from Japan.Other than the fit and the cheaper build, as they feel like a hard drop might break them, they will have a place in my headphone and earbud collection that‚Äôs getting out of control. You can‚Äôt expect these to be the best headphones ever for the less than the $300 price I managed to get these for on sale. I basically dropped a star for fit and build, but for the price and sound, these are really hard to beat. I paid more for the Kimber Kable for my Shure 846 earbuds than I did for these headphones. I am currently waiting on another cable to be made for my Focal Clear headphones as their factory cables are not that great and the upgraded cables sound better and are not as stiff as the Focal factory cables plus the upgraded cables are not cheap. It will also have a 4.4mm TRRRS termination as I plan to use them with this player.Update June 12, 2021Well I finally got my Astell&Kern player exchanged for a brand new one several weeks ago and now these Audio Technica headphones have broken in very well. They are actually a much nicer sounding product than I originally thought they would be. I want to buy an upgraded headphone cable for these as I still think the headphone cable makes a set of headphones sound much better as do speaker cables for your home set up, It‚Äôs generally a huge upgrade over the supplied cable provided with every pair of earbuds or headphones that I own. I‚Äôve purchased upgraded cables for all of my earbuds and headphones in the past and the supplied 4.4mm cable is a little on the short side. I have gotten use to these being more ‚Äúon the ear‚Äù headphones and not over the ear like almost all of my other headphones. I might just have big ears. I saw these on sale at another site for $450.00. If they had been that much here I would not have bought them. However, after owning these headphones and since they sound incredible now compared to how they did originally, I think I might pay more than I originally did for these Hi Res Headphones. You‚Äôre not going to find a pair that has the 4.4mm termination and Hi Res in this price range! I‚Äôve looked everywhere for another brand and came up empty handed. I prefer headphones that I can get a better made cable for and are balanced.They sound incredible with my Astell&Kern Kann Alpha and I have been using them more than I originally thought I would. Earbuds make my ears sore after awhile and these are the best sounding headphones that I‚Äôve ever heard for under $500.00 and a few over that price point. I would highly recommend these to anyone who is looking for High Resolution sound as I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre going to find anything that sounds this good for the price. The sound has definitely changed for the  better now that I‚Äôve had them for awhile and they are broken in. The Bass is just the right amount for me personally and it blends perfectly with the minds and highs. My Shure 846s also sound incredible, and they have more Bass which is unbelievable and more of everything, but I also paid $1,200.00 for them when they first came on the market in 2016. They originally came with a clear waterproof case and a bunch of extras. They don‚Äôt come with the Pelican style case now and I really like the case. But, they are just not comfortable enough for wearing as often as I would like. I really don‚Äôt notice enough difference that matters between the two unless I immediately switch from the more expensive Shure earbuds to these impressive Audio Technica headphones. I honestly can‚Äôt believe that I found a pair of 4.4mm cabled High Resolution headphones that sound better than my high end Shure earbuds. It‚Äôs a very good set of headphones for the price.One review said that the stitching looked like it was done in a hurry or improperly. I think it is just how they are  designed in order to get these to seal properly on the ear. These also fold flat for easy travel and the photos of damaged parts that other buyers are posting appear to be customers who do not take care of their headphones properly. I own several different headphones for portables and for home audio, which have either a 250 or 600 oHm rating and require a lot more power to drive them. None of them have ever had problems with the ear cushions wearing out, or the kind of damage in the photos. I guess time will tell. The only issue I have ever had with headphones was a pair of Sennheiser headphones several years ago where the left channel just stopped working after a couple of weeks. I have tried another pair of Sennheiser headphones and they also didn‚Äôt last very long. So, it has put me off on the brand. I also prefer wired headphones to wireless headphones. I am not a huge fan of wireless headphones and I think the best sound comes from a physical connection. Just my personal opinion. I have read that you can‚Äôt get true MQA resolution from Bluetooth headphones from various AV forums.I also made the comment that they seemed cheaply made, but I dropped them from the counter onto a tile floor and they did not break. I guess they are much more durable than I gave them credit for. These come with 2 sets of headphone cables. One 4.4mm TRRRS that fit most Sony DAPs and some of the newer Astell&Kern Players. I have the Kann Alpha and these have made a huge difference in my High Resolution files as well as my Tidal Premium subscription. I am going to try Amazon‚Äôs HD music service to see if I like it as well. I also have several Japanese MQA CDs and I can play and rip these to my player with the Astell&Kern newest version player/ripper device.So, I‚Äôm going to have to give these the 5 stars that they deserve after owning these for awhile now. I have a set of Focal Elegia Hi Res Closed-Back Headphones that sound great, but I generally use my headphones while my husband is watching TV. The Focal cords are very stiff and I‚Äôm waiting on a custom cable to be made for them. These are closed back, but some of the music can be heard by people close by.  My husband hasn‚Äôt complained about any leakage at all. I‚Äôm surprised as they sit on my ear and not over my ears. I tend to use them more often than the more expensive pair of Focal Headphones as they have some leakage and it interferes with his TV watching. I will probably use them more once I get the custom cable and when he‚Äôs not watching a TV show. Like in the morning or in our office. But I love these Audio Technica headphones and I‚Äôm very happy I purchased them.I also felt that they where a tad snug for my big head, but I pulled them out more than I thought they would go originally as I didn‚Äôt want to break them when I first got them. Now they are not touching my head anymore. I am generally lying down on our sofa on my back when using them with my player, but if I was to wear these out, I would snug them up some. I included a photo of these, the neoprene case and the extra cable that will work with an iPad or iPhone. I don‚Äôt use my iPhone as a portable player and never have. I purchased my first DAP, the Astell&Kern AK100 and I have three of their players. I‚Äôve tried several different brands of devices and Astell&Kern make the best sounding players on the market. I have had Fiio players in the past that had issues with hanging up, requiring a rebooot and I have returned them. I must say however, Fiio makes nice DACs and Amps for iPhones and iPads, but I have not tried any of their newer players. I‚Äôve tested a few other brands at a high end stereo center in San Antonio and they didn‚Äôt sound nearly as good as the Astell&Kern players. They are expensive, but worth the price. They do offer the CT15 player that is a steal at $299.00. An incredible little starter player for those who don‚Äôt want to dive headfirst in the deep end! I‚Äôm actually considering buying one if I don‚Äôt get in trouble for spending to much on my audio addiction!I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend these Audio Technica headphones to anyone I know, even some of my wealthier friends that have incredible high end headphones and flagship players. If I had known that these were going to be my go to headphones, I probably would not have purchased the pair of Focal Headphones!
I did not expect the clarity or quality of five hundred dollar headphones with this purchase. I did expect better clarity than a twenty-five dollar pair of earbuds. This is where these headphones performed poorly. First, the build quality. They are all light-weight plastic and pleather (plastic leather). This makes them comfortable out of the box and very lightweight. I appreciated that the ear cups were not huge on my head and fit nicely over my ears with a bit of room to spare. The problem with them fitting loose out of the box is that when I turned to look at a family member, after wearing them for all of two minutes, they slid off my head easily. I had not adjusted them out in any way, so this is the most snug they will get. I don't have a particularly small head. Perhaps these are geared towards someone with a larger head than average. When I purchase hats, I'm a medium to large, if that helps.I purchased both these and the Beyerdynamic DT 770 pro 80 ohm headphones as I couldn't make a decision based solely on reviews and specs. I believe I'm a bit of a novice audiophile and I was looking for headphones which would help muffle the noise of my other half's booming voice while I work on my trilogy. We have a small house, so while I understand switching to working from home during this pandemic, it means we are both in the main living space, which doubles as an office for us.I had determined to try both headphone sets, after much online research and pick my favorite, fully expecting this headphone to be the winner. I was very surprised that for an extra hundred dollars over the DT 700's, the cords with this set were much cheaper quality and I question their long term durability. The box they come in is nice, but I saw no carrying case. There was a flat pouch for the cords but if that is meant for the headphones as well, I wouldn't trust them not to fall out, as it doesn't zip or seal in any way.Now, as for sound quality; I listen to mostly blues, blues inspired rock and symphonic orchestral music. These all have a variety of instruments and pitches, which the headphones were expected to reproduce clearly. These headphones were OK with the low end (bass), but I definitely picked up on some unnatural amplification at that end...making the bass sound digitized, not soundstage or natural. The mids were where this headphone fails for me. All the mid-range sounds were muffled and synthesized sounding, more so than the bass. There was quite a bit of sibilance (hissing and smeared) in the mid-range as well. The highs were muted and unnatural. Basically, as much as I liked the light-weight and low pressure feel of these headphones on, I just couldn't get past the poor quality sound reproduction.If I hadn't ordered the Beyerdynamics at the same time, I might expect this is just what I get for spending less than five hundred. However, the BD's were one hundred dollars less, have more metal and thicker plastic cups and sound a world apart in quality of reproduction. I listened to Larkin and Poe's new album, Buddy Guy, BB King, Lord Huron, Walter Trout, Gary Hoey, Black Eyed Peas, 2 cellos, The Beatles, Beethoven, and Gov Mule as well as a few others on both headphones. In every case, the 700's were crystal clear in the mids, mostly clear in the highs (you have to be an audiophile or looking for the very slight drop) and clear in the lows, with no emphasis. With the classical symphonic, I could hear rustling and throat clearing, as well as breathing they were so clear. This may detract for some, but I appreciate feeling as if I'm in the room with the orchestra. This clarity made my blues shine anew. The AT's on the other hand, muddled every note and made the mids (a large part of blues) sibilant and hazy. I am not impressed. Perhaps these headphones are for those who listen to folk and modern rock more or perhaps those who just want artificially emphasized base notes and don't worry about clarity of the music they listen to. I can only guess. For me, these are going back and the 700's are staying.One last note, I intentionally did not purchase ANC headphones after listening to and reading dozens of reviews stating that white noise negatively impacts the sound reproduction for those who pick up on nuances. Neither of these state they are noise isolating. I expected only some ability to block out voices and was surprised when, once again, the 700's did a noticeably better job of muffling outside voices. I can't imagine true "noise isolating" headphones do any better. The pads are larger around, as the ear cups are larger. They also have slightly thicker pads. These two factors are what lead to them doing a better job of isolating my ears when in use.
Other reviews do a much better job at detailing the sound quality so I won't spend much time on that other than to say I think they sound great for the price.The reason I take away two stars is because of the build quality of the proprietary cables. I am about to order my 3rd set of replacement cables for the headphones in two years. They aren't exactly cheap and the headphones rarely leave my desk so they aren't getting beaten up either. I've had to replace them for the same issue each time: a static sound, usually in one side of the headphones when the cable rubs against my shoulder as I turn my head to the side. You can replicate the issue by applying slight pressure against the jack on the side having the problem or even just by rotating the connection with your fingers. If you stay perfectly still there is no static, but it doesn't take much movement to induce the problem once it has started.I would probably recommend these headphones if it weren't for this issue. Disappointing considering the cost.
Sound quality is great, I can hear many details, for some people maybe a little lack of bass but for me it is quite enough, punch is also great. Also I can hear a bit of nice sub-bass. Upper range isn't sharp but also isn't subdued ‚Äì really well tuned headphones. A bit V-shaped with slightly raised upper-midrange.About soundstage and imaging: maybe it is a little above average but in my opinion could be a little better for this price.Comfortability is almost perfect for me, headphones is lightweight, pressing force is average, ear pads are large enough and soft.Included case is pretty but I would prefer some other more durable case. Cables are amazing ‚Äì soft and do not get tangled.My MacBook Pro can easily run this headphones with or w/o my iBasso DC03, volume is enough, comfortable level is about 50-60%. But if you want to get more sound quality and more accurate frequency control you may need to get external DAC/AMP, something like iBasso DC06 (with balanced socket) or something better. Sound gets progressively better with more serious DACs/AMPs/players.
These are impressive headphones‚Äîcomfort and clarity are strong points, and soundstage is more than good enough.  I feared I was going to have to spend much more to get satisfying sound in a closed-back headphone, so these have been a pleasant, bargain-priced surprise; more detail follows for those interested.  I use these headphones exclusively at home, plugged into a dedicated headphone amp, and listen mostly to CD-quality classical music.  That is probably not the purpose for which they were designed, given their high efficiency and short cables.  But they work remarkably well in that setting.  I‚Äôve owned three pairs of headphones over the last ten years or so:  the original M50s (not the current X version), AKG Q701s, and now these.  I never liked the M50s, despite all the good reviews, finding the sound unengaging and the fit uncomfortable.  I replaced them with Q701s, which have been wonderful, except for the sound leakage.  They just don‚Äôt work for listening in a quiet room with other people.  I decided to supplement them with the MSR7bs a couple of months ago, despite my bad experience with the M50s.  So far so good.  I would describe the sound as precise, honest, and thoroughly enjoyable.  There is more detail than the Q701s, allowing individual instruments to emerge crisply.  They are certainly mid- and treble-centric, but the sound (at least with my music, my equipment, and my 60+ ears) is never edgy or shrill.  And the bass is fine.  I was just listening to the digital remaster of Adrian Boult‚Äôs 1970 recording of Vaughn Williams‚Äô English Folk Song Suite and noted that the timpani and bass drum in the marches are a powerful presence, as they should be.  The sense of space lies somewhere between the very closed in M50s and wide-open Q701s.  I find it sufficiently extended not to distract or interfere with the music.  They are much more comfortable than my old M50s as well.  The cables included caught me by surprise, however, both ending in small angled plugs (one 3.5mm, the other 4.4mm) with no adapter supplied.  Perfect for mobile devices, but not so much for home use.  I had to acquire an adapter for my amp‚Äôs ¬º‚Äù connections before I could even try them (my fault for not reading carefully enough).  The cables are also short, but I knew going in I‚Äôd have to use an extension. Isolation is limited, meaning I can hear much of what‚Äôs happening around me (a good thing in my view), and sound leakage is non-existent at my normal listening levels‚Äîan absolutely critical point for me.  My sample does have a small pucker on the earpad seam, but I hadn‚Äôt even noticed it until I read Bullwinkle‚Äôs review and it doesn‚Äôt bother me.  I will say that the ten-year old M50s, despite having more plastic, do seem to be built more robustly than the MSR7bs.
I'll get straight to the point. If you like a lot of sub bass these aren't for you. There is a noticable bump in the mid bass however. If you enjoy very detailed crisp music these have you covered. The only thing holding these back in my opinion is the sort of unnatural vocals. By no means does this headphone sound bad. I think these are worth it if you're willing to try something different.
[Update 8/2/2022]I am knocking these down to 4 stars as the cable stopped working for the left ear, and I had to order a replacement cable. I also had to replace the earcups as they began to flake really badly, and the headband is likely going to need to be wrapped soon as well. I love the sound and portability of these, but I wish the durability was better.tl;dr:Good sound, comfy, short cable, great for home/office useBackground and Overall Thoughts:I've been eyeing these ever since they were announced Q3 2018, and finally bit the bullet when I saw they were in stock. These are my first over-the-ear headphone, so I can't give any meaningful sound quality comparisons, but these blow any on-the-ear out of the water. I definitely noticed a step in audio quality, and minor details come through much clearer in a range of songs and genres. The entire spectrum to me seems very "natural" and "lively," but I'm not an audiophile so take that with a grain of salt.In the Box:The box is nicely packaged and includes the headphones, 1 3.5mm cable, 1 4.4mm cable, paperwork, and a soft neoprene carrying case.Build Quality:The build is quite light, yet feels sturdy enough overall. The arms connecting the ear cups to the headband are a hard plastic, while the other components are either metal or faux leather. The cable is somewhat lacking, especially in length. Besides the short cable length, I also would have preferred a thicker cable that could take a little more abuse. The included soft case is decent, but with headphones I prefer to keep them in good condition with a hard case.Comfort:These can be used for hours and still feel great; the cups are decently larger than my ears, and the compression is minimal. They do not fall off my head when leaning all the way forward or back.Final Verdict:Overall I'm really enjoying the sound these cans produce. The build quality leads me to only recommend them for home/office use, or some light travel use when handled with care. For what it's worth, these haven't been broken in much (~20 hours), so let's hope these only get better :)
It looks nice, feels comfortable after hours of listening. The sound quality is solid, no "artificial" bass, all clear and natural.However, it has a few serious issues which motivate me to write the review here:1) the cable is really short. I use it to attach to computer monitor where the port is. If I lean back from office chair, the headset will be detached.What puzzles me is: there are two sets of cables provided; why not just provide one set of cable but long enough?!2) the sound quality is nothing spectacular. Consider it costs me $250, I expect some WOW. I guarantee there is no WOW from it. There is barely any 3D effect.3) The headset fits well -- only if your head is not too big. My head is medium size and I have to use the largest setting on this headphone to have a good fit.
I ordered these in February 2020. I have had no issues since then. They are comfortable and good both for desktop and portable use., but isolation could be a bit better.I will say I have some trouble getting a good seal depending on what glasses I am wearing, and that is important for bass response. The bass quality is good, but not overly plentiful.These shine on well-recorded vocals and instrumental music. They accentuate female vocals and horns especially well.I pair them with a ddHiFi TC44B when out of the house and a Schiit Modius-Asgard 3 stack at home. They offer a nice contrast in sound signature from my Sennheiser HD 6XX by having a more airy treble.I did not like the stock 3.5mm cable, so I ordered a new one from Hart Audio Cables with both 3.5mm and 1/4 inch interconnects. You do have to make a special request for the A2DC connectors for these headphones.My overall rating would probably be closer to 4.5 out of 5.Be on the lookout for Amazon Warehouse deals. I got mine that way and saved a bit of money for what looked like untouched headphones.
I've been on the hunt for an affordable (but still great-sounding) neutral, detailed, easy-to-drive, closed-back set of headphones, for use in a quiet office. These tick all those boxes.They do a great job of not leaking sound, which is crucial for office-use. Other closed backs I've used leaked too much sound. Not these.Build quality is good for the price, with a mix of metal and plastic. The only negative is a slight creak when handling them. I think the creaking comes from the plastic inside the headband.The cables are around 3 feet long (rather than the more typical 4 or 5 foot length of other headsets). But I actually prefer this shorter cable. I drive these from a phone siting on my desk, so I welcome not having to manage a large cable. The cables do have some microphonics, but nothing that I ever notice when listening to music.Bass is well extended. Maybe 2 dBs north of neutral, but not bloated at all.Mids are decent but slightly recessed. About 2 dBs south of neutral.Treble is detailed, but not harsh. About 2 dBs south of neutral.Detail retrieval and sound stage are both excellent for closed-back headphones at this price point.If you're on a budget of $400 or less, and looking for a neutral but enjoyable set of cans, that don't leak sound, for office use, these should be on your short list.

These are an adorable pink color. Even the foam padding around the ears and on the head is pinks dark even the cord is pink. They are very nicely padded around the ears and the top of the head. They can lay flat for storage to be either put in a drawer or hung up on the hook.These headphones have a lot of great functions to them. My favorite function is the belt in volume control. That way there is never any issues with me having to check the volume coming in to the earpieces. There‚Äôs also a built-in microphone, making these perfect for online schooling. Because they have a cord they never need charged or need batteries. This also makes them very light weight as well.I tried these on and was very satisfied with the sound quality. It was perfect for music and YouTube videos as well as voice and communications over zoom.The on era design is perfect for a long time wearing. It doesn‚Äôt leave any pressure points on my daughters ear. Plus they are larger than an earbud and much easier to locate.
My little one loves to play my phone and the computer but he‚Äôs always playing them to loud so I got him these headphones ( he loves pink so he got pink ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). He likes that they are pink and cushioned and fit him well instead of falling off his head like the bigger ones do or falling out of his ears like my earbuds do. I like that I can control how loud he is playing them since constant loud noises can damage his ears. This is a must have to protect your little ones if they like to listen to a phone or computer. Great value
Flimsy wire
Bought as apart of my son‚Äôs kindergarten supply list. Works perfectly for him.
Our first grader needed these for class and we wondered how we could ensure volume is jot blasted. Glad they make this where you can control the volume. The foam is good where there are no complaints coming from him. But yeah‚Ä¶ the best part is the volume limiting feature. Love it.
My daughter is going into Kindergarten, and her school requires wired headphones on their school supply list. These are perfect‚Äîthey fit her well and comfortably go over the ears to block out ambient noise in the classroom, and they limit the volume to a safe level. The cord is hard wired in which I like better than the ones where you can unplug the cord both from the headphones and the computer. (For some reason, the sound quality on those seems to fail more easily than when the cord is permanently wired into the headphones.)  They fold down completely flat to make for easy storage and transport.I tried thesee headphones out myself and they will get loud, but not *too* loud. The sound quality is decent and should be fine for school use. Plus they‚Äôre pink, so she‚Äôs excited about them. üòâ
With all the use of iPads, phones and more devices by little kids these days, they're certainly also using headphones to listen to those devices.  But how do you know as a parent if the volume in those headphones is acceptable or dangerous?  You can certainly set the volume before you hand the device over - but different content can have different volume levels - and of course the volume control is always close at hand for those little fingers.  These headphones are comfy and have great sound - and provide that level of comfort to the adults to that they limit the volume they can produce.  And they do work - you can keep turning it up and it won't get TOO loud!Overall these seem to be good quality - at least considering the price, these aren't several hundred dollar studio headphones after all.  The ear pads are nice and comfortable for small ears and they have a good deal of adjustability to deal with growing kiddos.  They even have a built in microphone for calls or interacting with content.  The only slightly worrying part is the cable - it's fairly thin and seems a bit delicate so not sure how that will deal with the inevitable yanks and pulls and twists over time, but it's working fine for now.  And if they work for a year or two then that's not bad for the price.All in all, if you're worried about protecting your child's ears - but still want to give them headphones and a device to use - then these are worth a try, particularly considering the value.

Really great sound quality, not just 'for the price' but overall. PreSonus knows sound. I do have to mention the sound bleed. We got these for my wife to reference her live vocals in our home studio & they are not ideal or even recommended for this application. A budding engineer behind the console in the booth, or close-referencing the mix at a respectable live event is where these will excel.
First pair of wireless headphones that I have ever had. So far, they seem adequate. Pretty comfortable. Can wear for hours. Sound is decent / balanced. (I LOVE music, so have a decent ear and appreciation for sound). I don‚Äôt play at a high decibel / volume.  I have experienced Bose noise cancelling, and these are a far cry from those - but not my main concern.  A little on the heavy side if you are really expecting to take on intense activities. Seems to connect easily to my I phone. I haven‚Äôt tried using it for phone calls though‚Ä¶so don‚Äôt know about quality of that feature.
I got these on sale for thirty bucks. For that price you can't go wrong, I don't care who you are or what material you listen to. Upon opening the box you will notice they are well packaged and as soon as soon as I pulled them out of the box, light weight and flimsy are the first two things that came to mind. I have somewhat big ears and they completely enclose and seal my ears with room to spare, however they are in no way too big. They feel very comfortable, partly do to the light weight. After a very long three hour session they did begin to feel slightly uncomfortable due to the clamping force. They can be flexed by hand in a way to make them squeeze a little less and that did help. As for the sound quality, fantastic! I use these for mixing when I want to hear my mix on something else to compare to my monitors or if I'm doing some late night mixing and need to keep the noise down. They have a very flat response and can take everything I throw at them. I produce/mix mostly electronic music, Dubstep, DnB, etc... and if I low-shelf these ~+2.5db @ 150Hz then I get an extremely accurate representation of what I'm going to hear in my car for example. At the normal selling price of around sixty bucks I might just go ahead and spend another forty to get Sennheiser HD380 instead. What I don't like about these is that the cable is not replaceable (-1 Star). For the price I paid, it's really a non-issue, but as I mentioned if they would have been their regular selling price, I probably would have spent a little more for the HD380's which are sealed (these are semi open) and also have a replaceable cable. One last thing to mention regarding the semi-open design is that I expected to hear quite a bit more ambient noise and it wasn't the case. Besides, once the music is going ambient is not even an issue. Hope this helps someone else considering these.Update: They really don't block out as much ambient noise as I had originally stated. After using these in more situations, I have to retract that from my original review.
***update***The HD9 cans are not closed back.  This is probably why they sound really good but leak like crazy.  Why in the world did nobody not mention this?  This thing has seven or eight holes out the back on the cans.  They are the size and style of what you would see if you removed the pads.  They holes are on the top and hard to see, you have to flip the cup and look at the "seam" part.I'm still on the fence about these cans, but you should consider these semi-open.  I'm going to have to modify these guys so I can use them for vocal tracking.See original review below, the leakage was noticable immediately.***original review***These sound good enough.  That's pretty subjective anyway.  I would say they're flat adjacent.  And they're more comfortable than a whole host of studio headphones which seem to never want to stay on my head, or pinch everything around the ears.  My head size is snapback hat size 4 snapped in, 3 unsnapped.Now to to iffy stuff.These aren't noise cancelling at all.  Obviously these aren't active noise cancelling but you will hear sounds if someone is in the same room as you.  What I mean is that I can't zone out and ignore whatever is going on without turning the volume up to the uncomfortable zone.On to the thigh test.  Yes it's a thing, look it up.  These leak.  I can't possibly believe that a condenser microphone wouldn't pick up the leaking sound from these if one were to use it for that purpose.Pros: Look nice, sound nice, fit/feel really nice.Cons: Non-replaceable cable, super annoyingly long non-replaceable cable, leakage both ways.I may or may not keep these.  It's one of those, "not all that bad, not all that great" type of products for me.
Comfortable and sound great. I have three of these.
Pretty good backup pair of headphones for mixing music for producers and djs. nice sound quality.
Are these really 4 star headphones?  For less than $30, which was what I paid,  they are actually a bit better.  If the cable had been removable,  they would have gotten the extra star. That said,  it is solidly constructed heavy and sturdy.  I don't expect it to short out at all and I use these as one of my main pairs--the others are the Sennheiser 439s (light, comfortable, but dull)  Superlux 668B, and ATH M40x and ATH-IM70 IEMs.These are closest the the 668B in sound.  A bit bright--but no annoying sibilance.With Cosmos velour pads--the ones on board suck- for an extra eight dollars here at Amazon (or, if you want to spend the dough, Beyerdynamic replacement pads) -http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KLPRQMO/ref=gno_cart_title_0?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A3528NABKVABNY - they can't be beaten and sound better than almost any--up to $150-- headphone I've tried.This is not a bass head phone,  it is for studio and critical listening. I use them with Macbook Pro and iPad with Fiio Q1DAC and an HP laptop with idsd nano black and my home stereo. They can take a serious volume load from a stereo amp or soundboard without distortion,  but can be driven by smaller amplification sources easily thanks to low impedance.As for clamping,  they're snug but not so tight they are uncomfortable--at all--even after a couple of hours of listening.This is one of the best deals I've ever gotten from Amazon.
PreSonus HD9 Professional Monitoring Headphones are excellent. I bought them to go with my PreSonus music software that I have been using for many years. I expected high quality because it is PreSonus and that is exactly what I got. These headphones are great for listening to today's pop music as well as old orchestral classical music. I highly recommend these headphones.
Have used both wired and bluetooth with no issues. Initially had crappy sound quality over bluetooth because I had a dinky, dated BT antenna on my PC, but upgraded that an am now happy enough with the sound quality. Satisfied with comfort of headphones too.
Noise canceling, given the price is quite good, but not incredible. Perhaps 70% reduction. Sound quality is not audiophile level, but low and mid range are sufficiently warm. It seems the low end is a little fatter with noise canceling on. High end is missing a little sparkle when noise canceling is on, but improves when it is off. I listen to a great deal of baroque music and small chamber orchestra and the depth is very acceptable.  They are comfortable for long wearing, but a little sweaty in warmer environments. Long battery life, direct plug in if needed and ease of pairing are all pluses. I‚Äôd be happy to buy them again.

This is a sanity saver for my grandson who has severe anxiety and neurodivergence.  It helps him get through crowded events and even school.
I loved it. works pretty well, just as described.
Pros: Everything except headband durability. The noise cancelation is awesome. The sound is deep. The feel is awesome.Cons: The headband is weak, as this is my third set of Sony headphones, and the last two broke at the headband, both at a different location. But due to other qualities I bought three of them so far. I don't know if that says something about my loyalty to Sony or what...
Vet comfortable and light weight. Good quality as expected from Sony.  Noise cancellation not quite on the level of my Bose but for half the price pretty good.  Controls are a bit confusing so perhaps I should read the instructions. Good sound, especially base.  Caddy was a nice bonus
They can get really uncomfortable if you wear glasses and it just kind of hurts. Even when I'm not wearing my glasses there isn't enough padding to keep my ears away from the hard plastic speakers.
excellent for the price
Headphones are very important to me. I struggle with focusing, but these headphones have altered my workflow and productivity SO much!
It worked as it should
They are definitely worth the price and very reasonable. Great sound quality and wonderful for my iPhone.
Great headphones with great sound quality. Would definitely recommend.

Es mas abultado que otros dispositivos similares, pero el peso est√° bien, es c√≥modo para correr por mas de dos horas y compensa con su bater√≠a que hasta el momento no ha fallado. El sonido es bastanet bueno y se escucha a√∫n mejor con los tapones auditivos. En las llamadas se escucha perfecto, pero el microfono no es muy bueno, especialmente en exteriores, la mayor√≠a de las llamadas debo recibirlas en el tel√©fono. Despues de lagunos meses tuve un uico problema de conexi√≥n, se qued√≥ bloqueado y no encontr√© ayuda en manuales ni foros, pero solo fue cuestion de esperar que se agotara la bater√≠a, cargar y listo. quer√≠a unos audifonos que me sirvieran para correr si preocuparme por que se caigan o por la bater√≠a, as√≠ que estos me han gustado mucho, no le pongo 5 estrellas por el microfono, pero no fue para eso que los busqu√©.
I got these headphones for lap swimming and other aquaric exercise.  They are waterproof and held up while I swam, except when I went completely under water, the Bluetooth would disconnect. I also wish there was an adjustable option, the head band was too big for my head and I had to tuck the headphones under my swim cap to get them to stay in place while I swam. I also wish the buttons were easier to push and it was easier to tell when the headphones were completely off (maybe a beep or specific sound)  if I were to find a better option I would go with the other option. These headphones met my minimum usability requirements but have leaps and bounds to go towards improvement.
Muy bueno para ejercicio pero pense que iba a tener mejor sonido con los bajos, pero esta bien
I could not get it to sync with the TV and no help with the instructions either.
This was exactly what I was hoping for.  So far I am very pleased.
Ordered these to use while swimming. They work fine most of the time, however music cuts out if I dunk my head below the water surface, even though my phone is only at the end of my pool.Only had them 5 months, kept charged, now find that they won't power on.
I have had these for over a month and ran the Brooklyn Half Marathon with them. They are great so that you can listen to music but still hear your surroundings. Taking calls with these does not really work, but I did not buy these for that reason .. I purchased them to be able to hear cars and people and have conversations while I run and still hear music in the background. One of my favorite things is that there are lights on the back of the ear piece and it can blink or just stay on!
ive gone threw so many bone condution head phone the main problem it cuts out when im not that far awaythese  philips open ear headphones sound awsome and you can go farther away from your phone great battery life very happy
In principal, these earphones are excellent. However, in actual use they leave much to be desired. Because it‚Äôs bone conduction, there‚Äôs a level of vibration which made me dizzy. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs because of this product or any such product that is a bone conduction headphone. In any event I had to return it because it was making me dizzy. I felt like my eyes were crossing, and there was too much ambient noise.
Works well in the shower or swimming.

I was recently in need of closed headphones with a $100 budget and curious about what the market offers. I thought I might share my findings with someone in a similar situation. The Shure SRH440 turns out to be the most accurate, neutral sounding closed cans among the eight headphone models that I have compared. Below is my review of these headphones.I am a speaker builder with measurement equipment, so I know what is neutral and undistorted sound. Unlike speaker systems, most headphones have no crossover or frequency response correction circuit. So, it is critical to be able to know how much such uneven responses affect perception of their sound with respect to accuracy and neutrality. I have good sense of it since I have been measuring sound. But I do not have proper equipment for headphone measurement, mostly importantly a dummy torso/head, nor am I willing to invest time in making a DIY setup. This is the reason why my search and audition have been limited to headphones for which measurement data exist, with some exceptions (see below). I made use of three different sources for the data: InnerFidelity.com, Headphone.com, and en.GoldenEars.net. While there is consistency within each site's measurements, there is also inconsistency between them, due to different measurement conditions and compensation methods. So, I researched and took those into account.One may say we can use EQ to remedy irregular frequency responses. But EQ has its own limitations. Some minor EQ'ing can help, but headphones that need too extensive correction should be avoided. The foremost reason is the loss of dynamic range. Theoretically, with EQ you can only limit, not increase, dynamic range in a certain frequency band. On the source side, you lose digital bit depth, and on the headphone side, you suppress the driver's efficient response range.Below is the list of headphones that I have auditioned (in the order of their street prices):- Tascam TH-02 ($30; no data available)- Panasonic RP-HTF600-S ($32; semi-open headphones)- Brainwavz HM3 / Incipio F38 ($35; no data available)- Tascam TH-2000 ($50; no data available)- AKG K518LE ($50)- Sennheiser HD 429 ($65)- Creative Aurvana Live! ($70)- KRK KNS 6400 ($85)- Shure SRH440 ($90)My DIY speaker system (it measures very flat) served as a reference with respect to tonal balance. I also own some open headphones like Sony MDR-MA900 and Sennheiser PX100, which also provided a baseline when I evaluated tonal balance of the headphones under comparison. I used a desktop headphone amp that has flat FR and reasonably low output impedance.I will give short, summarized impressions for each pair.Tascam TH-02 (no measurement data available)This is a really nice surprise. There is a little hump in the bass and midbass regions, and some wide, shallow dip in upper mids and lower treble (i.e., slightly polite presentation). Otherwise, these are relatively accurate headphones at a fraction ($30) of cost of headphones of comparable quality. Construction is good for the price. The pad size is between over-ear and on-ear, but comfortable enough.Panasonic RP-HTF600-S (semi-open headphones)Warm tone, deep bass. Treble is there, but upper mids and lower treble are lacking. Comfortable to wear. A good value, but not great for those looking for reasonably accurate sound.Brainwavz HM3 / Incipio F38 (no data available)Mid/upper bass ruins the sound which has otherwise good midrange-treble balance. Very uncomfortable to wear due to non-swivel cups.Tascam TH-2000 (no data available)Simply inferior to its younger brother TH02. Very dull and muddy presentation. The model uses the same ear cups as TH02 but contains different drive units. The driver may have better components but execution must be bad. Not worth the asking price.AKG K518LEYou need to remove the thick foam pad at the driver's front (easily removable) to have better bass-to-mids balance. Even the pad removed, the phones still have bass-oriented sound, but not bad. Mids to treble balance is good. Somewhat similar sound signature to Tascam TH-02's. But the TH-02 sounds a little more natural. The headband can be too small for some people. The clamping force is a bit above a comfortable level.Sennheiser HD 429Anothter pair of headphones with bass emphasis. Not overly bassy, though. But a bigger problem is treble, which is a little too polite to be neutral. I would not consider these headphones a good value.Creative Aurvana Live!Smooth and warm tone. Bass is somewhat loose at times. Treble has sparkles and at the same time sounds smooth. But relative to bass and treble, upper mids and lower treble are somewhat recessed, making the headphones' sound colored. Some people may feel them musical and full, but I prefer the Tascam TH02 at a lower price. The appearance is very good, though, with some feel of high quality. Very comfortable to wear with memory foam pads.KRK KNS 6400It has much more neutral sound than the headphones described above. Mid- and upper bass is somewhat lacking, and treble is a little overly presented. Good monitor-type sound. But there is one problem with these headphones. They are not very efficient, which means their usability is limited---you need a desktop headphone amp or a high-current capable portable amp to make them sound good. A little too bright treble is a weakness, too.Shure SRH440Without doubt, these are the best of the bunch. Perceived dynamic range is unbelievably wide. These are in a different league in terms of clarity as well---perhaps, the KNS 6400 is close but also with weaknesses (see above). Treble is sometimes a little on the bright side, but not as bright as the KNS6400's. Some people may find them bright with bright recordings, but the headphones should not be blamed for that. These produce very neutral and accurate sound. Bass is sufficient and often pleasantly strong in the mid- and upper bass regions, but deeper bass is not covered by these cans. Most music recordings do not contain this deep bass, anyway.I summarize my findings with the following top two picks:1. Shure SRH440: These are the headphones you can safely choose under $100 if what you are looking for is accurate, neutral sound.2. Tascam TH-02: This is a secret gem. At $30, you get really good closed cans. Its overall presentation is not as clear as the SRH440's, but with their price factored in, you cannot complain. They are definitely in the same league as the AKG K518LE (foam pads removed) and the Creative Aurvana Live. It may depend on personal preference, but among the three, my pick is the Tascam. The Creative has a better look and feel, but I'd choose the Tascam for its sound.Another headphone model I wanted to include in my search was the Sennheiser HD 280 Pro ($90-$100), but after I listened to the Shure SRH440, I decided not to. According to HeadRoom's measurements and many people's common impressions, the HD 280 Pro has a little subdued treble compared to the SRH440 which has great mids to treble balance when compared to my reference speakers. The Sennheiser covers the lowest octave much better than the Shure, but that is not my priority.I also considered the Koss ProDJ100 because of good reviews, but ruled them out because of their measurements. Their response might be flat in fundamental tones from most instruments but not with harmonics due to a large dip around 5-6kHz. Some people may think they sound good, but there is no way for them to sound accurate and natural by my standard.
Very nice sound. Full range is there, and everything is well balanced. Some of the best sounding cans I've tried. Relatively flat response, but not boring or bland. Still great for general listening. The bass tight and clean, and not over emphasized. Mids are full but not muddy. Highs are clear and rich, not harsh like cheap headphones. These are more comfortable than the 40x and 50x from Audio Technica, but still a little heavy, and they could use a bit more padding on the headband, perhaps. But still pretty comfy for a heavy duty pro set of cans. Ear pads are not that thick so there is some potential for tips of my ears to get sore eventually. Hopefully I can find a some thicker replacements. My only real complaint is the coiled cable that comes with them. It's so short and heavy the audio source has to be really close to my head. Fortunately Shure sells a 2.5m straight replacement which I bought and now I can use these for recording and playing my digital piano. Isolation is decent enough, but I haven't tried recording vocals with them yet.  Build quality seems study enough for studio use. Headband is metal inside. But the cups don't rotate so they are not as portable as DJ headphones. Overall I would recommend these to any producer or anyone else who works with audio professionally.
PRE ORDERMission:I bought these looking for a replacement for another pair of headphones for monitoring purposes.Attractions:The first thing that attracted me to the Shures was the claim of flat response obviously intended for the professional studio (as labeled). The second thing that attracted me to these headphones was the low price. Another thing that REALLY attracted me to these was the REMOVABLE locking cable. I've had trouble with previous headphone jacks that ended up with me having to go buy a new jack and stripping the cable to solder it on, so it seemed like a pretty sweet feature to save future trouble.Picking the Right Set of Cans:I was doing some research on good studio oriented headphones below(or at) the $100 price point. I came up finding these(Shure SRH440), the Sennheiser HD280 Pros, and the Sony MDR-v6's and/or 7506's. And obviously I came to choosing these.  POST ORDERFirst Impressions:I had watched a few unboxing and review videos of the Shures just to see what I'd be getting, so nothing out of the box VISUALLY surprised me as I had seen it all already, but when I took them out of the plastic bag and actually held them in my hand myself, I was lovestruck. They are nice and heavy(in a good way) and VERY solidly built.Build:Like I said before, these are quite hefty in weight, but also in size. (Which I like a lot, but for those looking for smaller, lighter cans, I don't think this is where you want to go) The plastics used on the headphones are very solid and of high quality. I guess I had taken the build of the previous set of headphones I was using as fair, so when I just grabbed the earcups and pulled them apart I was blown away with just how well these things were made.The headband is made of some flexible material covered in a synthetic leatherette, and feels sturdy yet moldable. It sits nicely atop the head.From what gathered from the few moments the stock earPADS  were one the headphones before I took them off to replace them with some upgraded SRH840 pads I had bought at the same time as these, they were okay in quality. A tad stiff though.The cable is a nice, thick coiled one around 10 feet long that starts up on a SINGLE side of the headphones rather than a Y-cable, and terminates to a 3.5 mm/ 1/8 in gold plated jack.The jack itself has a threaded end to screw on the included 1/4 in (whatever the equivalent is in millimeters) adapter. The rubber/plastic on the end of it has a nice grippy part to it that makes it easy to hold and plug in to whatever you need to. A small detail, but I found it quite nice.Comfort:Like I said a short ways up in the previous paragraph, I bought a set of replacement earpads that normally go on the big brother of this product, the SRH840, on suggestions of other peoples experiences with these headphones. I tried them on with the stock pads before I swapped them and like people said, the pads were fairly stiff and shallow. Immediately thereafter I put on the other pads. They were thicker, softer, and more comfortable. The most noticeably difference I would have to say though is the padding on the INSIDE of the pads that cover the driver. It is much thicker and of better quality. So during long wearing sessions I can see these being much more bearable. I've also heard claims of the pads improving sound quality, but I didn't actually listen to them before I swapped the pads so I can't confirm them. ** I also have pretty prominent(sticky-outy) ears that usually become discomforted quite soon after putting on headphones, but these are (now anyways) deep enough with thick enough inner padding that it's not much of a problem.The headband is quite "cushy" and forms rather nicely to the head. But sometims, when wearing them for a long time, the top of my head begins to get sore where it rests upon my head.These headphones are actually pretty tight gripping on my (seemingly) normal sized head. I like that A LOT, but I'm sure it bothers the hell of some people. I've heard people calling them loose, but they aren't to me.Overall, they feel very nice to me sitting on my head.Now with what was my greatest fear about ordering headphones,Sound/Sound Quality:I have previously listened to studio oriented headphone and they seemed "canny" and fit the closed back headphone STEREOtype(pun), and I hate having to wait unnecessarily for things, so I was afraid of ordering these before actually listening to them under the cause that they would sound crappy. I'll tell you right now, my fears were misplaced. The SRH440's sounded pretty darn good on the first listen. I still haven't burnt them in the full 100 or so hours suggested by many, but they sound great already. The highs are nice and crisp, the mids are warm and smooth, and the bass is lush and extended. I am currently playing pink noise and assorted sounds through them, and after a few of days(with breaks, don't worry) hey, maybe they'll sound even better.As far as isolation of outside noise goes, the Shures do it quite well. I'll give you an example of how well they do it:I've had really loud music been playing through speakers in the other room, and I put these on as earmuffs to block out the sound. Obviously it didn't completely shut out the sound, but made it quiet enough that it wasn't unbearable to hear.The soundstage with these is actually pretty wide and spacey. Things panned hard left or right sound more spread apart than other closed back headphones. Now I haven't heard a lot to compare to them (especially not open backed/open-air headphones which are supposed to have the broadest soundstage), but these headphones give me such an awesome stereo image when listening to music.If I had to describe these headphones in two words, it would be these:SUPERIOR VALUE.Well there's my two cents. Haha, I hope I didn't miss anything.Awesome headphones.
Sound quality is good, clean, clear and low noise, but I feel not as comfortable wearing it as wearing some other high end headphones.
Great sound for under $100. I only marked 3 stars for noise cancelling since they aren't. I use them for listening to music and as monitors for podcasting and online platforms.
I have used these Shure headphones for music editing and gaming, and they are excellent for both.  As studio headphones, the music part is not surprising, but the frequency response makes them excellent for gaming as well.  They are comfortable over-the-ear headphones that I would purchase again if I had to (they should last a long time, depending on the quality of the ear pads).
I needed an upgrade to my old headphones that (admittedly) I got at a garage sale. Nice full size headphones but the cable was getting damaged and had that annoying volume control feature. I think its cool but at the same time stupid because I find it the first thing to go. I fought with them for a while until I finally had it. So I went looking for an upgrade that would cater closely to what I'm doing more nowadays, that is home/studio listening for enjoyment and music production. I live in a rather noisy area where I hear the fire trucks and ambulances coming and going regularly and among other things. So I needed a pair of closed-back headphones for isolation as I find the sound reproduction of noise canceling headphones to not be as accurate and nowhere near this price range. I also wanted a set that offered the replaceable cable and ear cups option as decent headphones can last a long time but these two parts always wear out before decent drivers do. Amazingly enough I discovered the Shure SRH 440's. I got everything I was looking for. These are really nice headphones for what they're designed for (e.g. home/studio listening). These might not appeal to people used to higher end equipment but as a start into the world of detail and sound resolution it's wonderful for the price.There are drawbacks that I feel some people miss about these. These don't have much bass impact (e.g. you don't really feel an explosion so much as hear it.) The sound signature is a rich neutral (e.g. it strives for balance and clarity, middle of the road). They are not really made to be run by Iphones and Ipods. These guys need a little more power to drive them to their full abilities with a headphone amplifier. They sound good unamped but sound their best amped. One other thing is these sound particularly tight and bright out of the box. There's nothing wrong with them because they need to be "broken-in." Some people like the sound from the get go, but for me it took a little getting used to. Over time the drivers have been slowly relaxing and loosening up making it sound even better with time. If your looking for nice pair of headphones that will last and deliver great sound, these are a nice choice at this price bracket.PROS  + Marvelous sound that is balanced and clear. - Even at really low volumes (while amped) I can still hear amazing detail.  + Great isolation. - I don't hear the traffic anymore with these on and I'm not cranking these. I listen at very moderate levels.  + Removable cable for cable replacement. (Or to change to a higher grade audio cable)  + Solid build. Can fold up for easy transport and storage.  + Gold-plated Plugs (For signal efficiency.) 3.5MM with a screw on 1/4 plug.  + Full-size over the ear cups.CONS  - Shallow cushions - The rim of my ear rests against the drivers. Depending on position can become uncomfortable.  - Shallow Headband cushion - There is some cushioning but mostly to cover up the inside parts.  For me it gets a little uncomfortable in certain positions but once I find the spot I'm content.As these aren't powerhouse audiophile headphones, they don't require a serious amplifier to run them.If your a budding audiophile, spend a little more on your headphone amp and you'll be happier for it.My experience (if you wish to know)Putting these on and turning on the music is like being transported. I found myself relishing music even more through these as I began to hear it in a whole new way. I enjoy all kinds of music from Metal, Classical, Folk, World, Electronic and Alternative. When I put on Vivaldi: Four Seasons (FLAC format), I couldn't believe my ears. The clarity and beauty of this music resonated out of drivers with such detail. The descents and ascents of the lows to highs and back were a treat. String instruments sound incredible in these as well (Violin, Acoustic Guitar, Cello). One thing is you'll notice the quality of your music more. You'll hear the effects of the poor sound reproduction in the higher compression formats. However, you'll also notice other parts of the music that cheaper headphones can't reproduce when listening to CD's. Some music will be more appealing in these than others. Mostly music that relies more on its musical detail (Classical, New Age, Flamenco) than impact.
The drivers way above the price range for sure. They sound just about as good, if not better than my trusty old ATH-M40xs.The only problem with sound is that, because I have a wide head already and I'm stretching out the headband to the max, so much as a yawn will widen my head even further, making this headband emit cracking/popping and squeaking noises as it stretches, around 1.5x as loud as what I'm listening to. It's really disruptive to movies and music. Metal-structure headbands generally don't have this problem, in my experience.Now, they are my dedicated studio monitor headphones. Like the name intends lmao. The cracking and popping noises, although distracting, doesn't mean it degrades driver performance so they're still very useful for monitoring.
Before I review these headphones, I must say something about their intended purpose. These are NOT designed for listening to music anywhere except sitting down in your home or in a studio. The cord is incredibly long and bulky, and the headphones are far from stylish. If you're looking for headphones you can wear on-the-go, stop right here and go look for some in-ear-monitors or smaller sized headphones. If you are looking for the best sound quality you can find in $100 headphones, and don't care much about anything else, this is probably the right place.Design Overview:These headphones are MASSIVE. These are my first pair of studio monitors and I was not expecting them to be as giant as they are. I have a normal sized head- These headphones look ridiculous on me and on larger heads, still seem pretty big. I am not a very fashion-minded person but even I think twice about taking these around. The headphones fold up for convenience, allowing them to fit in my backpack without too much trouble. The cord is one of my biggest gripes with the headphones. It is not on par with the quality of the rest of the headphone.Comfort:These headphones will hurt your ears and the top of your head after about an hour. I was very disappointed with the stock earpads, and the plastic headband is covered by what seems to be leather with little to no padding. About a month after I bought these, I ordered the replacement earpads from Shure's higher end version of the product, the SRH-840, and slapped those onto my SRH-440. I am much happier with the comfort of these headphones with this 15 dollar investment.Cord:The only thing I like about this cord is that it is detachable and twists to lock into a jack on the headphone. I have a lot of issues with the stock cord. It is something like 10 feet long uncoiled, and even coiled up takes up too much space on my small computer desk. The cord is cheaply made, with the wires nestled into a plasticky tube that gets kinked up permanently much like a garden hose. Within three months the cord was unbearably tangled and did not coil up properly. With this stock coiled cord, it is impossible to go anywhere with the headphones as you have a large bundle of cord that barely fits into a pocket by itself, much less with an mp3 player. I replaced the cord with Shure's straight cord, just to find the cord was still something like 8 feet long, and made of the same low-quality garden hose plastic. The best thing about this cord, how it locks into the headphone, also made it very hard to find a third-party, decent cord. After some hunting on eBay, I found a reasonable length cord made from decent material. I should not have to go through this much trouble to find a cord I can walk with, and don't completely understand the appeal of a cord this long, unless you sit 10 feet away from your audio jack in a studio.Sound:I'm no audiophile, but I can tell you without a doubt that this is some of the best sound you can find in a headphone at this price range. Each instrument in your music becomes separate from each other, and much more clear. Low quality earbuds will bother you with how muddled they sound after listening to these cans. With a headphone amp such as the FiiO E11, you can even hear small details of each instrument that are difficult to describe. The sound of these headphones is never harsh, and the sound is warm but crisp. The only downside of the sound is a minor deficiency in bass. A lot of headphones have far too much bass, but these have the treble slightly overpowering. I'm not complaining- this is easy to fix with a small EQ adjustment.Conclusion:Overall, these are great headphones. I'm fairly picky about quality, and most likely, others won't have as much of a problem with the design of these cans. The manufacturer was likely trying to keep the price down on these while still maintaining an entry-level audiophile sound. Thanks for reading my review, I hope it helped decide your purchase.

8/28/2022 - I bought these back in 2014. They continue to work to this day. Where the cup attaches to the headphone band broke this morning. Considering that's the only issue I've had in 8 years, I'd say even the Gen1 is still a great deal for some really nice headphones.

I'm sure that if you have a big head they might be tight. They do not move no matter if you are doing floor exercises or jumping around. They sound okay I'm hearing notes and lyrics I've never heard before, lol. I bought these because my old headphones (cheap) would be too loud on 2 but would be also be to quiet on 1. Got these and they were doing the same thing...I'm dumb. I had to disable absolute sound in my phone settings, lol. These are about as good as the Bose quiet comforts I had.
Pretty comfortable. The noise cancellation is great. My only critique is when you move your neck sometimes, it thinks you took off the headphones and pauses your music. I would purchase these again.
Si eres orejon te va a pretar algo, esta genial el preducto

When I run with these, there is a continuous ticking/clicking sound coming from either speaker at anytime. The sound quality is not what I expected. Switching from mid-priced/range earphones to these expensive headphones, I expected much more.They are also top heavy. When doing slow and controlled sit-ups, these headphones flop back and forth.They fall off. Not sure if it's due to the top heaviness or the loose swivel portion of the phones but when I bench-press or lay down, they slip off my ears.The auto-stop feature works when it wants to.Excessive wind noise when running.Random speaker noise that sounds somewhere between white noise and a dial up internet connection that only goes away when your cycle the power.When doing full extension chin ups/pull ups, my shoulders smack the oversized headphones.When setting up or moving my head ever so slightly on the standing calf raise machine, the headphones bang on the should rest due to their large size.Overall, they fit very loose.The only think I like is the long battery life.These certainly aren't worth the original retail price of $300 nor the half-off price.
The ears pads are so soft. Love that it can be taken out to be washed. Music quality is good. The pairing is seamless and took only 2 sec. Worth it buy!
Son impecables estos audifonos, su dise√±o, sus materiales que apesar de ser pl√°stico son muy livianos pero de excelente resistencia, son muy c√≥modos no se sienten pesados ni apretados son los bastante justos para que no se caigan pero no tanto que lastimen, el sonido cuando los prendes por primera vez Dan mucho de desear pero cuando instalas la app que viene con este y modificas el ecualizaci√≥n, sin duda alguna compiten con marcas premium del mercado sin duda los volver√≠a a comprar para el gym pues son de los mejores, aunque si esperas que sean de la misma calidad para v√≠deo juegos o para personas expertas en sonido claramente no son los mejores pues el √°rea para el que est√°n destinados no son estos sino para el ejercicio o el gym
No tiene el audio intenso que uno espera, ni siquiera con la app, no anula por completo los ruidos externos , materiales corrientones
Authentic from JBL. Washable ear pads, sweat proof.Been using it for 6 times a week with ANC, charge it once the first time out of box, haven‚Äôt charge it since. Battery charge is about 50% left. Per use is about 2 hours of gym.Worth the money!

I was so, so excited for these. Beautifully built headphones made with sustainable materials? Absolutely yes!For the only real positive I can give, yes, these look and feel outstanding. The bamboo wood cups are gorgeous, the metal bits are super sturdy feeling, the cushions are nice and soft, and even the cable is really really nice. There's even the colors of the Rastafarian flag on the connectors instead of standard black. I also strongly appreciate the company's dedication to sustainable builds, and it's something I wish more manufacturers would look into, especially if it can create something as nice as this.But that's all I can say for the positives. These are built wonderfully, but it's clear literally all of the budget went into that. These things are bass heavy to the point of ruining music, no matter what I played out of them, and on top of that, the bluetooth sounds atrocious for high frequency instruments like cymbals. Just to give a rundown of what I tested these with:- Earth Wind & Fire - "Let's Groove." This is a super tight track with a nice thumpy low end and really bright harmonies in the vocals. On here, all you hear is the kick. There shouldn't be sub-bass on an early '80s R&B track, yet it's here, and it's genuinely the only thing you can make out.- Bob Marley & The Wailers - "Concrete Jungle." The company is named after Marley, so you'd assume reggae would be really good on here right? Nope. Reggae has a ton of low-end, and on here, it's so loud it distorts. And as expected, the high-end is just not there.- Converge - "Concubine." I test headphones with this because it's an extremely loud, extremely compressed, blaring track and on bad headphones it's just pure noise. It isn't QUITE that on here, and amazingly it wasn't super boomy, but it was still awful for one reason: the cymbals. They are complete digital garbage on here, super crashy and given how much they're used, the song is unlistenable.- Nirvana - "Lithium (Live at Reading)." Live tracks are a good way to test the soundstage with the crowd participation and ambient noise. There's no soundstage here. Just super flat left and right, while on better headphones you get a lot more of a 3D sound.- Iggy & The Stooges - "Gimme Danger." This track is super blown out and loud, and I'm not joking when i say it just sounded like fart noises on here as soon as the bass and distorted guitar started.Also feel the need to note, over the wire, these sound perfectly fine. It's just whatever amplification they've done for the bluetooth that is ruining the sound. But that's not the point of these, I wanted some true wireless over-ear headphones and these are a horrible choice for that.Thanks to all these sound problems these are already a nonstarter, but on top of that, they really aren't that comfortable. Again, amazing materials, but they clamp super aggressively and on top of that, even at their largest setting for me they still weren't quite big enough.I can't recommend these, and it's heartbreaking because I love the ethos of the company. If you want good quality around this price range, I would recommend the Edifier W860NBs; they aren't built as well, but the sound is leagues above and they fit so much nicer. If you don't mind a wire, Beyerdynamic DT770s are the best you can get for closed backs in this range, honestly they're one of the best you can get full stop.
To start these are very clean sounding overall but the presentation of sound across the board is very inconsistent; I've heard a lot of negatives about the mids (which does feel pulled back in general) but some songs perform poorly in lows and highs as well. Describing the sound in these is actually quite the challenge. I do believe these actually sound better wireless as the bass seems to be a little more forward than when it's connected to an amp but it handles the Bass Boost and Treble Boost from my Syba Sonic quite well. I should mention that the sound quality on these overall is what one might expect for $50-$80 as my Ghostek SoDrop 2 sounds better overall than these and they cost $70.Implementing aluminum, stainless steel, FSC Certified wood, and various other premium materials and can say unquestionably that these are rather resiliently built. They come at you with a bit of heft but with that also comes a sense of security, that you have purchased a truly premium item. With all things I recommend caution (don‚Äôt buy something expensive and abuse it and then blame the company for it being messed up). The ear-pads are something that leave me a little worried as I don‚Äôt know of their longevity and they are non-replaceable.Comfort is as difficult to define as the sound as these are very unforgiving headphones. There is no flex whatsoever to the ear-cups and the headband is firmly square. I can honestly see these being very uncomfortable for some people. They fit me comfortably for the most part but I wear a hat whenever I‚Äôm out of the house and at that point these can be very uncomfortable at the top of my head. These do get very warm over time which for many can be a total deal-breaker so that‚Äôs something to be aware of.I‚Äôm at the crossroads with these. I love their design, I love their build quality, I love the fast-charging and battery life, and I‚Äôm pleased with the included accessories but on the other hand there are a lot of inconsistencies with the sound and comfort that are hard to ignore. I‚Äôm planted firmly on the fence with these myself, but for most I wouldn‚Äôt recommend picking these up due to their poor mid-range performance.
What a frustratingly great and bad product. The design, materials, and build of these headphones are absolutely phenomenal. H.O. Marley has done a tremendous job with the look and feel of these cans. I‚Äôm a headphone guy and solely in terms of design/materials/build, they are among the very finest headphones that I‚Äôve ever seen. However, trouble comes into heaven quickly with sounds quality. No offense to those who feel these phones deliver good audio quality, but it simply isn‚Äôt the case, and can be backed up with spectrum analysis, frequency response analysis, etc. In Bluetooth mode, they‚Äôre just short of horrible. Cabled sound is an improvement, but still disappointingly muddy. They look and feel better than nearly any headphone I know of (even ones that are 3-5 times the price) and the sound quality would have to be really bad for me to return them. Unfortunate, it is. If H.O. Marley could just spend a little more time with the Bluetooth technology, the drivers, and the tuning, I‚Äôd recommend them to everyone I know. The problem is that I‚Äôve been a music nut/audiophile for decades and the Exodus phones just don‚Äôt make the cut in quality of sound. ...yet so very beautiful.
Not perfect, but close enough to earn 5 stars.Pros: - As a non-audiophile I think they sound great. - Super cozy big earcups, and just the right amount of pressure on my medium sized head.  I wear them for hours without any discomfort. - Pretty good build quality.  Not at all flimsy.  Feel like they'll last for years if treated well. - Battery life is incredible.  I haven't charged them in weeks, and I haven't seen the battery level go down at all since then. - The wired inline microphone is really good, according to folks I've called. - ANC works well enough for me, but these are my first pair of ANC headphones, so I have nothing ot compare them to. - Environmentally friendly!  The wood and metal feel way better than any plastic could.Cons: - The biggest issue is the built in microphone.  When these headphones are connected via Bluetooth and I'm on the phone, my friends on the other end say my audio quality is terrible.  I have to speak loudly to be at all intelligible.  Using them in wired mode fixes the issue. - Once or twice the Bluetooth connection has dropped unexpectedly, but they reconnect right away. - When Bluetooth is on but nothing is playing there are occasionally very quite, high pitched sounds.  Not a big deal since they go away when I play any audio.Despite some minor annoyances, I still love these and would highly recommend them.  No pair of headphones is perfect, but these are pretty darn close.
The inside of the cup has a bit of metal that extends into the ear and causes me intense pain after wearing for 1-2 hours as it pushes against my cartilage.
I've used House-of-Marley products before (and I will again!) because I love the style and their mission-Sadly a rivet popped within a month or two of purchasing , which I don't really mind but around that time I also completely lost sound out of one of the ears!! Not sure what the issue is, but it's a big bummer.
The headphone quality is just great! They are beautiful and very comfortable. If they cause you ear pain, you are definitely wearing it wrong! My only real issue is that the sounds bleeds too much! also the sound quality could be better. I am not a music producer or anything like that, so they are just fine.
Where the ANC falls short; the cushions make up for it. Don't expect ANC Tech a la Max, but this is good enough. The 50mm drivers make the difference here... Very comfortable, Nice Retro Look. Im always grabbing these before the Max... So Happy w this Purchase.
The ear cups are like wearing super soft pillows, they are so comfortable, BUT they wouldn't fit over my ears so they smashed my ears to my head.The sound quality is good enough that I almost kept them even with the discomfort of the headband.The Headband is extremely rigid and it either fits your noggin or you need a metal worker friend to sort you out. I have a larger head and these were extra tight on the skull.If you have a narrow head and smallish ears, these are your dream headphones.
I did not test the bluetooth wireless mode. They are to be returned shortly.The sound quality is pretty nice, nothing especially notable in my time testing, although the headphones themselves hurt to wear for more than a few minutes. The pair I received didn't appear to be as well-shaped on the band as product pictures suggested. It was rather flat and constantly pressed down against the top of my head, resulting in a mild headache as long as I was wearing them.The cushions around the speakers were very comfortable, otherwise.These headphones certainly are built sturdy--which was originally what I was looking for and I was very pleased about. They look absolutely gorgeous, too, but with this constant low-pressure headache, they're not worth being kept, let alone used at all.

Probably still in break in period -about 100 hours- but these are impressively capable lightweight comfy cans for tracking.I usually mix with open back headphones and monitors, but needed a closed back pair for voice overs and tracking. They seemed a bit warm (physically) at first as i am used to velour pads, but these don't get hot. They just stay a bit warm but not uncomfortable.Reviews on these things are all over the place. Some say the mids are forward, others say the mids are veiled or recessed. They are bright, they are neutral. Here's what I say:Sounds is Good at jump street. After break in, the brightness and harsh treble becomes smoother yet stays lively. Mids are present- only slightly recessed with some male vocals. Sonic texture is amazingly good. You do hear things in songs you never have before. High transient response keeps sound right and accurate. Sound pressure effects are present due to closed back design. Soundstage is wider than expected but not some crazy immersive experience. The main obvious drawback is that they lack mid bass punch. That's the only thing, but...It makes up for that missing mid bass with smooth and low deep bass extension that starts accurate and not sloppy. Too bad nothing is perfect. But I think this helps for all day sessions. No sibilant highs or head punching bass. Just long smooth (not perfectly linear) fast response.If you listen to them as audiophile headphones, it depends on taste, mood, and the recording. But they are audiophile contenders. They have just been around so long, they aren't new enough or expensive enough (anymore) to be on the dance card. But you can't wear 702s when you need a closed back. So don't overlook these. As good as anything else in the running but twice as comfy, half the weight, and a quarter of the cost.If you talk about then practically and realistically, they are an accurate and effective tool that will definitely help you mix and master all types of media.Every monitor, driver, or can colors and influences the sound. So, these are not the end all, be all solution. But these can easily be a part of it.Super light weight. Very comfy-I'll probably try some hybrid ear pads. I do love velour for comfort.Cons: The cord is crazy long and does not detach. It's not a deal breaker for me, just an inconvenience.
AKG Headphones were the only headphones we would use at Death Row Studios.  Snoop Dogg would always use this model when he did vocals.  He said of all Headphones in the worlsd, these were the clearest!!!!! We got 20 pairs form his home studio when we put it together!!!! Ill never forgey Snoop asked,"did we get those AKG Headphones. I said of course. "Thats our secreat Weapon!!!," Snoop said!
Got these to listen to a musc program. The sound is amazing and they are very comfortable to wear.
Replaced my 20 year old Sony Studio Monitor headphones. While the sound is not quite as good as the Sonys, they cost about 20% of what I paid for the Sonys, and they're MUCH more comfortable.  I use them for keyboard practice and some hobby recording and they're adequate.
These headphones absolutely require headphone amplification, a quality DAC unit, and a set of Brainwavz earpads. After pairing to an FiiO K3 unit (USB 2.0 @ 32bit, 384kHz), replacing the earpads and running an 8-hour break in, these things sound absolutely incredible. The earpads that came with the unit allow for a bit of a "boxy" sounding, but very, very precise and clean sounding highs and lows. Replacing the earpads allows the precision sound to be fully experienced, while also isolating the sound better (reducing most of the sound other people hear). To be clear, the bass isn't going to vibrate your skull, but it is clean, precise, and powerful, while the volume can go to max without distortion. The mids and highs are crazy clean and can get very, very loud, again without distortion.$50 headphones$20 pads$100 DACWorth it.
These are great entry level studio/audiophile headphones. they don't have ANC (active noise cancelation) but they are closed back so they have good isolation so if you are in public or on a plane you won't here people and people won't here your music. they are pretty comfy too. if you want to make them even more comfortable they get some velour earpads for these headphones. they cable isn't removable but that has never been a problem for me as I have just wound it up and used 2 twist ties to tie it up. I've been using these for roughly 4 months now and I really enjoy them.
I purchase these for my hubby... He has his studio where he records and writes music for future artists... So far so good he loves it!
Really enjoying these, as others have said, they definitely have a clamp factor but I'm confident it'll lessen over time. Aside from that they are pretty comfortable; it could just be the clamping but at the moment it feels like the sides of my ears are touching the drivers slightly, but again that could clear up. They are way lighter than I expected so there is no real pressure on the top of your head. I actually wanted to find out how light these were so I weighed them and they weigh nothing. Literally 0 in every unit of measurement.Other minuses that have been mentioned are the very long cable, which most people will find to be entering the realm of absurdity. To the poor reviewer whose cable got tangled up in the wheels of their chair until they threw the headphones at a wall in rage; thank you, you've inspired me to coil the cable and tie it up so it's effectively 1.5 metres rather than 300.I'm not much of an audiophile, but I've been making s***ty electronic music in my bedroom for the past two years so I know a little bit about sounds and stuff. These sound really fantastic to my ear, although my only comparison points are consumer grade in ear headphones and a pair of Marley Liberate XL's so keep that in mind. The XL's are pretty good but they lean noticeably towards lower frequencies, having Marley's signature warm, bassy sound. These on the other hand are supposed to be neutral so I was worried that with my electronic tendencies there wouldn't be enough bass to satisfy me. Strangely that is not the case at all, the bass doesn't sound much quieter than my Marley's, it's punchier and a hundred times more detailed.As a little side note, the fact that the bass didn't disappoint me lends a little weight to the man who said these had very bloated bass. I don't have a pair of headphones that I know are fully neutral so I can't say for myself whether the bass is actually bloated, however I can say that the bass never feels overpowering and doesn't smother the mids or highs, all frequencies sound incredibly detailed to me, especially the highs. In fact, the highs are  a tad harsh in certain songs with particularly harsh percussion, I've mainly experienced this with trap and haven't had any issues with jazz, rock or old school hip hop,‚Äì only electronic music.On the note of highs I haven't heard any noticeable sibilance excepting during "Heartbreak" by Yelawolf.They aren't particularly portable, but I sort of like the purity of the fact that don't really do anything except play music. No in line mic or controls, no bells or whistles just good music, which is a pretty beautiful approach and embodied by a very beautiful pair of headphones. These look absolutely stunning, despite the fact that the materials look (and probably are, given the price) cheap. I'll definitely be keeping AKG in mind for future purchases on account of their appearanc alone.I think that pretty much sums up this review. I like these a lot and have been primarily listening to music over the past couple of days to hear all of the details I missed before, everything sounds so much clearer and more alive than before. Would definitely recommend these cans :)
These are super comfortable. They fit around my ears perfectly without pressing on anything despite the fact I wear glasses and have a helix piercing; and the sound quality is pretty decent for the price. If I hadn't had a pair of Avantree and Meze headphones to compare them to I probably would have kept them ...but. In comparison they are rather tinny and have severe sound leakage. I didn't buy them for noise canceling but if that's what you're looking for definitely don't get these, there's literally no difference between having them on or not. The only way I could drown out the cartoons in the background was by playing music and turning up the volume. But like I said these are still good for the price of $45. Avantree Audition were the same price and have the choice of wired or Bluetooth with a better sound though the ear cushions are narrower and don't have a self adjusting head band. The other headphone I bought was the Meze 99 Neo which sounds pretty similar to the Avantree, though slightly better but with the  price tag of $199.
frankly, I bought these mainly counting on the AKG brand to deliver the goods- I was looking for headphones to use mainly on my electric piano with a few requirements in mind: sound insulation, comfort ,good sound and a decent price.Trying them on, I could immediately notice that they don't stop much of the noise from coming through.. comfort is fine and so is the sound but this is damaged due to back noises.. I have a pair of earphones bought on Ali express which I used before the K72. it is rather sad to say that they do a better job in this matter. Wouldn't recommend these.

Had a very nice pair of Bose that got "borrowed" from me on an international flight, decided I wasn't going to spend that much on another temporary set of NC earphones, I found this model by Sony.  It was about $50 at the time, which was only a quarter of my first (now traveling somewhere without me) NC headset.  I really like the simplicity and affordability of them, haven't lost these because they look so plain :-)Sound is clear, sound reduction is decent, have recommended them to several cabin crew and fellow passengers, even bought a couple sets to give my parents when they retired and took the 'round the world' dream trip they'd been saving and planning for, having NC headsets was equally appreciated by them!They do not come with any sort of stowage bag included, so recommend you grab something appropriate to keep the kit (headset and cord, it's included legacy airline twin-plug adapter, and a spare battery) neatly contained, rather than tossed loosely in your carry-on bag.  I found a very simple cloth "cosmetic brush" bag that fits the bill perfectly, YMMV.I mention these have a couple minor drawbacks...First, if you're looking for Bluetooth or wireless, these are wired use only.  On the other hand, their cord and simple appearance also makes these look to be an ordinary set of headphones and not a desired theft item.Second, these are not rechargeable, and it is easy to forget about powering down after a flight, so good idea to carry an extra AAA battery in your kit.  On the other hand, the power switch is not easily bumped, so you won't accidentally turn them on in your bag, and the battery drain is rather low so that even after a couple days sitting "ON" in my bag, they were still working.Overall, a very worthy purchase, and an item I recommend to others, though I think Sony could have stepped them up a notch by giving them rechargeable capability, via USB cable or such, and knock off a star for that reason in hopes they consider this feedback as a suggestion of how to improve an already decent product -- sometimes the little bits of customer input is all it takes to effect change, right?  This whole BT trend, not a huge fan myself, but point it out for those that want BT connectivity on everything.
Havent gone to the trouble of putting a battery in it. Not exactly what I was looking for but they work well enough. The padding is good except when I fall asleep on them for 8 hours.
Not bad for the price. Not the most comfortable. Not the best noise cancelling. Not the best sound. But for the money, they are better than the cheap ear plugs provided by the airline.
I was pleasantly surprised by this headset. I usually use Bose's $300+ noise cancelling headphones, but wanted something smaller and lighter. These headphones muffle noise, but don't entirely cancel it. They are on the ear, which is new to me, and I like it very much. Good enough sound quality, light weight, stays on my head while I move around with an MP3 player in my pocket. I am so glad I bought these, and got a very good price that day. A very happy music lover and audio book lover. Thanks, Bose. But they aren't noise cancelling, so I took off a couple of stars for the misleading description.
I bought these back in 2016 and have used them on and off since then. Most recently as a college student, driving my need for wireless option.SOUND QUALITY: While the sound quality is adequate, I am a person who loves heavy bass, which this does not give, but the sound quality overall is pretty good.NOISE CANCELLATION: It also does not completely cancel out noice, but does muffle/buffer it. In Starbucks, I had to turn up the volume on my computer to 75% to drown out talking. Likewise, poolside at the YMCA, I also have to amp up the volume to get any true buffering from the high sound. I am easily distractible so these are not ideal for noise distractions.  Even at home with dogs and kids, I find that, no matter what, I have to amp up the volume for buffering, otherwise I hear quite a bit.  I don't notice a significant difference in turning off the ANC. The same goes for vacuuming, yard work (such as using a blower) and mowing the lawn.COMFORT: The headphones are over ear and pretty comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. I have yet to experience significant fatigue from it.  I don't notice any extensive sweating while wearing them, either, which some have said is an issue with over the ear headphones. Granted, I'm not sleeping in them, either.DURABILITY: Over the several affordable on/over ear headphones I purchased for my daughters' use with online work, these were the ones she kept coming to and the only ones that have held up over the years. The cord is pretty durable, especially since I don't have a case for it and it often gets tossed into a drawer or backpack willy-nilly (yes, an outdated term, I know).COMPARABILITY: I have tried the Bose SoundLink II and Beats Solo3, both wireless headphones. If you are looking for comparable sound, you won't find it. Both Bose and Beats have these headphones beat, as would be expected based on price! However, I see quite a few complaints regarding durability of the material over time. I have no experience with comparison of Bose or Beats as these are recent purchases from family members. I can attest to the durability of my Sony headphones.CONVENIENCE: I like that my Sony headphones can work well with my 2018 MacBook Pro, as Apple didn't see fit to change the headphone jack for any of their computers from the 3.5mm jack to a lightning jack. I use the adapter on my iPhone and it works fine. I've used these headphones to run on a treadmill several times and they stay put. I'm not running sprints or marathons, though. However, they are wired, and wired ONLY. Meaning I can't be wireless, and they don't connect to my iWatch.For convenience due to connectivity with all of my devices, I would say that Beats Solo3 Wireless has everything I need, since I have all Apple devices and I really like having everything working together. Even my Alexa devices and Alexa Compatible plugs work harmoniously together and with my Apple devices. As a result, I will be looking for a wireless option that offers good durability and superior noise cancelling capabilities, though I won't be getting rid of these, as they really are great quality headphones, as expected with Sony (considering I grew up in a time where Sony was considered right up there, before Bose became a more well-known entity in the market).
I'm a  classical musician that listens to everything. I own the $15 Koss UR 18 ( comfy and with decent bass for the price) which are good at their price range. I also own $75  Senheisser HD 280. They are bulky with very good passive isolation, and more natural sound.I had the $450 Beats Pro for a while, and they were great for popular music , with control talk, great bass, and superior to all other beats.Now about these pair or Sonys:Sound: they have more bass and treble than the Senheisser 280, but these Sonys sound a bit hollow. For the price range it is Pretty good, I guess. Nothing impressive.  I like their boomy bass for some styles of music.Isolation: They reduced the bathroom fan and the bus ramble very noticeably. Voices are softer but at the same time you can hear words more clearly. So keep those differences in mind.(** update: two days later, it's been a few times that people talked to me in the house while listening to angry rock at 40% of volume and I did not hear them at all).Having said that, they're not as good as the Bose QC 25, but they are exactly  ten times cheaper.Portability: They fold flat and small in a way that is super compact. No bag included.It uses a AAA battery , easy to use, and it comes with one.Cons:No control to pick up calls.Trebles get harsh after an hour or so, and it hurts a bit, unless you can equalize it well. Sound can be a bit hollow in the middle.Comfort:They are very comfortable even with glasses on. My head is small though.I paid $30 for them, and sometimes I prefer them over the Senhheisser hd 280 to listen to music on the go, specially bass oriented music.The Senheisser are better at blocking higher pitch sounds ( ppl , tv, etc) bc they are big and press against your head, so I kept them for those situations.These Sonys have the *active* noise canceling , which improves their sound. >>>They still work without it, though. So you can listen even without batteries. Sound loses boom and volume, but they work.I'm pretty happy with them for the price. Note:When  I tried the $300 Bose Quiet comfort 20 the store went silent. Bass was not impressive. These under $50 Sony pair are probably not as good at isolating ( a 25% less, maybe?) but they are so much  cheaper at Best Buy or here,  and smaller. The bass is sweet, too.For a cheap option in casual portable listening with isolation, I'd give them a try. If you're an audiophile, or listen to classical exclusively, keep looking.I hope it helps!
Love these things. I use them all the time.
I use headphones for watching shows on my laptop. These headphones sound was so muddy that I sometimes could not make out what was being said by the characters. I switched back to my other headphones to make sure it wasn't something with the show audio, and everything sounded fine on them. I also dislike that the earpads are really small and not well padded. I returned these headphones.
Bought these for lawn mowing. Best pair I've found for under $50 that will actually keep the mower sound to a minimum. Would buy again
Wear them at the gym. Can not hear people next to me talking for an hour. Can not hear the loud music over the sound system. Can not hear the guy vacuuming all around me. CAN hear the music from my I-Phone loud and clear!

Solid construction and very comfortable (would add more stars for comfort if could).  I was pleased to hear how much more range of sound with a "fuller" sound I could hear over my "vintage" earlier headphones (not an audiophile and do not know the technical term for the fullness along the range).  You can remove the headphones safely by the metal clasps that connect to the cups, feels solid.I am using these with a Fiio K5 Pro ess and they easily handle sound at the mid setting with these 250 ohm headphones.  If there was any downside, there is a wire that connects to the headphones that may catch on something if you were careless and throwing them around, but the solid construction and metal clasp more than make up for that design (they will not break at any hinge).The hard shell case it came with is solid with velvet interior that fits like a glove with a large zipper.They fit solidly around the ear, but if someone has the TV on in same room, you will hear it when headphone sound goes down in volume.
Coming from a pair of Sony WH-1000XM3's, these sound amazing. I'm not an audiophile but I can tell that these have a much wider sound stage. I could hear much more than I ever could before. They sound great, look great, and are very comfortable.Where these completely fall apart for me is the cable design. Right out of the box the cable immediately bunches up into a mess of spaghetti. For a while I just tolerated it, but then one day I decided to put it into a cable sleeve. That helped, but it would still curl around itself. So I went to the extreme and fed some shish kabob sticks into the sleeve in order to force it to stay straight. I should have done that in the first place because it worked great. Then one day one ear decided to stop working unless I contorted the cable in a random way. Being annoyed with this I took the cable sleeve off to see if there was any sort of damage I may have inadvertently caused. There was no damage, but now they didn't work at all. Even with contorting the cable, I was extremely lucky to get them to work in one ear. Needless to say I am done with these headphones. Only having them for around 5 months, I never dropped them, sat on them, traveled with them, spilled water on them, nothing. But due to the cable constantly being bunched up I came to the conclusion that the wires inside the cable itself must have have separated or become frayed. Just ordered a pair of Sennheiser HD 599 that come with a DETACHABLE cable. Hopefully these will last longer than the Beyers.FYI these work great with this amp --> https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VDQQY95/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1TLDR: Great sounding headphones as well as comfort and looks. F grade cable design took them out of service after 5 months of normal use.
I bought these to pair with an Antlion ModMic as my other headset had died. I knew I needed closed back since I share a space. Anyway, they are a tad treble heavy, especially in between the 9-10k range, so I dial that down a bit with Equalizer APO. Aside from that, they have an exciting bass response that is excellent for games.The headphones themselves are very well built and they rest very comfortably on my head, even after several hours of use. The soundstage of these headphones is surprisingly good for them being closed back.All-in-all, I don‚Äôt regret my purchase one bit. Just be sure that you do your research and know what it is you are looking for in whatever headphone that you are buying.
Best I have ever owned
I use these for studio monitoring of voice recordings for narration / voice over. They‚Äôre flat response is outstanding. It makes editing SO much easier. EXTREMELY comfortable with LARGE cups, and ‚Äòfelt/velvet‚Äô covered ear up pads. I can wear these for 6-8 hours with no discomfort. Should‚Äôve bought these years ago. Cord is long and allows plenty of room to move in the booth, and at my desk while editing. Best money I‚Äôve spent in quite so e time. Made in GERMANY. GREAT QUALITY!! Can‚Äôt recommend these enough for voice editing. I haven‚Äôt pushed music through these and will not comment on that aspect. These are passive noise cancellation through ear cup padding and closed back design. Very good in that respect. I have larger ears and these fit me better than any closed headphones I‚Äôve ever used.
These produce very clear and detailed frequency response for studio work.  The earpads could be a little comfier, but they do a decent job of outside noise isolation.
Super comfortable. Can‚Äôt say it enough. No ear fatigue with these.
After LONG in-depth research these are the headphones I chose. I'm OCD about researching anything electronic that costs over a few hundred dollars. I try and find the best performance/price ratio while not sacrificing quality. These headphones sound amazing and are heads and tails above any headphones I've owned before. I'm really glad I chose the 80 Ohm model as they still work really well with my phone and give more than enough volume. The build quality is great and they are very comfortable wearing for long periods of time even though they are over the ear and closed back. Very happy with this purchase.
Amazing build quality and very comfortable. I can wear it for hours before it starts to get a bit uncomfortable but they fit perfectly, can be adjusted, and sound great. Everything that the reviews from professional sound engineers and producers say.
I first tested them with my iPhone, listening to music. The volume had to be raised higher than I wanted but they sounded pretty solid. The Mids were solid, highs were solid, bass was decent. My second test was in live performance. I used them with my aviom and the kick drum was peaking at mid volume! Tones were low as well. I tried a direct plug, no adapter, same thing. I raised the volume, it was worse. Personal use, studio use, they probably work great. For drummers and live performance, you will need something better.

Recently tried out 3 headphones: 1.) Audio-Technica ATH-MX20 ($49)  2.) Koss Porta Pro On Ear Headphones with Case ($35) and  3.) Monoprice Premium Hi-fi DJ Style Over-the-Ear Pro Headphones with Mic (also known by their product number, 8323, $29). I wanted some headphones for listening to music or movies on my computer. For "serious" headphones in a real sound system (over $200) I recommend Sennheiser, they are excellent and I love their balanced sound, but for casual listens on my desktop I wanted something cheap and comfortable. Short answer, the Audio-Technica's were the clear winner, just as you might expect from the higher price point. Read on for a more detailed review of all three.The Monoprice cans were the cheapest, but while the sound quality was inferior to the other 2, it wasn't terribly worse, just not quite as clear overall. The build quality also looked fairly durable, and they had one thing I really loved that the others did not, and that was a jack in the left headphone to plug in or unplug your cord. Since in my experience the cords in headphones are usually the first thing to wear out, this is a really nice feature, and could save you money in the end. They also came with a 3.5mm to 6.35mm (1/8" to 1/4") adapter, which was nice, and two cords, one with a built-in mic and one without. Importantly, BOTH cords were only about 4 feet long (apparently they used to include a longer cord, but no more.) I may have actually kept these but for one FATAL flaw: they were WAY too tight on my head. Now I assure you I don't have a big giant head! My hat size is an average one. I don't know who they are designing these headphones for, but if you're over 5 years old you may have problems. They could be adjusted for ear height, but this did nothing to reduce the pressure on my head. They didn't have enough swivel either. And the "holes" for the earpads were small, my ears fit in there but just barely, and I don't have extra large ears either!  So unfortunately I ruled them out.The Koss headphones were better in both sound quality and comfort. Again, not amazingly better, just about the difference you'd expect between $29 and $35 headphones. The bass was a little less muffled, the mids were more easily picked out, though the highs were about the same. But it seemed like they'd sacrificed on durability. In fairness, they ARE supposed to be fold-up, "DJ style" phones, and there was even a soft carrying case (useless for my purposes) so you wouldn't expect them to be very big and bulky. However there's just a thin band of metal going across the top of the head, and they are not over the ear type so no cushion around the ear. They are "on ear", which is fine, but forget any noise cancellation. There was some sort of "comfort" adjustment on both sides from "firm" to "light" (pressure?) but no instructions, and adjusting it did almost nothing that I could tell, just seemed like a gimmick. The whole thing was very lightweight, which was nice, but also appeared sort of flimsy. Could be wrong, but I could imagine them breaking fairly easily. Also the cord was only about 4 feet long, if that matters to you (and it did to me!). Pretty good sound though, for $35!The Audio-Technica sounded better still - yep, about $14 better than the Koss, so just what you'd expect. Bass was clearer though not intrusive (a problem I have with many headphones) and there was a definite improvement in the clarity of the mids and highs over the Koss and Monoprice. Nothing spectacular, but noticeably better, and they had a well-balanced sound. The build quality looked good, the band across the head was well padded, the swivel of the cans was great (so important for comfort) and  the holes for my ears were more comfortably sized as well. The cord was about 3 meters long and thicker than the others, and it also came with a 6.35mm to 3.5mm plug adapter. Overall, this seemed like the clear winner for my purposes.Are any of these going to sound near the quality of my Senn 598's? Uh, no. Were they worth their respective prices? Yes, for the most part, with the caveats that I can't speak to longevity at all, and Monoprice needs to seriously redesign their headphones with a larger head in mind...Recently tried out 3 headphones: 1.)

TLDR: Great product for the money. Four stars instead of five for the corners that were cut to keep costs down, but still worth your money. Great for kids that don't really treat their headphones well.  Monoprice usually has some great products for reasonable prices. I am often told that if I want to get a good deal on certain electronics, Monoprice is the way to go. I have been shopping with them for quite a long time, picking up several cables, monitors, and even drawing tablets for prices that compete with many big box names. These headphones are no exception, and if I'm honest, far exceeded my expectations!  Packaging was decent with extremely simple inserts to hold the headphones and cable in place, keeping them safe enough in rough transit. Build quality is also fairly decent, but a bit more underwhelming than the packaging. They're made of a light plastic mold that doesn't feel super sturdy when you're holding them in your hand. The build quality also hinders the initial comfort factor, unfortunately, clamping down on my ears for a significant amount of time before they were broken in. Even still, they hurt my ears when using them for several hours at a time, if not significantly less. Another downside is the cable that it comes with. It is extremely thin, and obviously made to cut corners for a better price.  Fortunately, it fits most 3.5mm stereo AUX cables, so if you don't like the one it comes with, you can just get a different one, or use one that you know is good quality. The earcups are made of a nicer quality leatherette material that has lasted as long as I have had them with every day use with no gorss flaking or tearing. The headband is also treated with a gel-filled pad that sits at the top of your head that wanted to come right off as soon as I took them out of the box. It's okay for comfort, but I found that the top of my head would start to hurt after several hours of use. The good news is that they sound great for the money. They have a really nice flat curve that lends well to a good DAC and EQ setup, which honestly makes up for the initial poor impression the fit and the cable gave me. Bass response is nice, and mids clear as they can be. Highs are a bit flat, but that can be fixed with a simple EQ change, thankfully.  Overall, these are a great buy for the money. A bit cheap feeling out of the box, but a surprisingly good sound for what you're paying. They really shine with a DAC and EQ setup, but can deliver a listenable experience right out of the box if you're looking for an easy plug and play solution! Very happy that I went with these!
I bought these over 2 years ago. I'm writing this as I'm shopping for new headphones, because I think it's time to move on from these, but I'm honestly considering buying these again just because of how affordable they are.Pros:- The sound quality is really good. I'm no audiophile so take this with a grain of salt, but they sound better than any other headphones I have, and about as good as the Sennheiser HD 202 set these guys replaced.- I like that the cable can be replaced. All of my previous headphone failures have been in the cable, especially where the cable meets the earpiece, and these solve that problem completely.- They are very comfortable for all-day wear. They fully cup my ears without putting pressure on them.- Personally I like that they aren't fully noise-canceling, because I prefer to be able to hear what's going on around me. These block out just enough noise to help me focus.Cons:- The microphone. When it was working, I had to hold it up to my mouth for my coworkers to hear me on calls. It stopped working altogether pretty early on in the panorama (granted, I had had these for a year already by then), so I switch to a flimsy Plantronics headset for meetings.- The "play/pause" button on the cable doesn't do anything on my PC, so it's kinda useless for me. It's satisfyingly clicky, though, so it's a nice fidget toy. Maybe this should be in the pros list for that reason.- I'm not sure if it's my PC's audio jack or the cable, but if it gets pulled on at all (I sit at a 90 degree angle to where it's plugged into the tower, if that makes sense), even though it is still fully plugged in, the headphones stop working. If I wasn't replacing them for other reasons I'd get a new cable and see if that fixes the problem. It has just been a minor inconvenience, though.- And here we are, at the reason they're being replaced - a reason that others have mentioned - the cracking plastic. The plastic on the sides started cracking after maybe 6 months to a year. Finally a few months ago it got to the point that one side was just dangling by a wire, but I was able to repair them with nail glue which held up pretty well for a bit. Both sides needed a full regluing eventually. Today, however, the glue was not enough. I wrapped it in electrical tape and added a makeshift splint, but it's definitely time for a new pair.Bottom line, I think these are really good for the price. As headphones they've been pretty solid for 2 years and they're cheap enough that it's not a big deal that they need to be replaced after that amount of time. If you're looking for a headset with a good mic for Zoom calls, I'd probably skip these (or buy a separate microphone).
Monoprice is known for selling good stuff for much much less (usually just cables and adapters), but I had no idea they sold their own headphones. These things totally rock for $30, and they totally would rock for close to $100, too.I mean, these things come with two cords, and an adapter. Go to Radioshack and you can't even get those things alone for $28!I was hesitant to write a review until trying out some other headphones beyond the crappy kind I'd been using before ($7 at Biglots!)  I also wanted to be sure to get at least a month in with them so I'd be able to review them properly.Overall, they sound great. For $30 I really think you are going to have a hard time getting anywhere close to this.  If that sounds good to you, don't hesitate to get these. But, if you're the type who has $300-$500 headphones, headphone amplifiers, DAC, pre-amps and all that kind of stuff, you likely won't be impressed. Well for $30 you'll be impressed, but you won't switch to these long term.The overall sound of these is on the bass-heavy side. They thump pretty well with rock music without getting muddy. Being "DJ" headphones, I think they're designed to be turned up loud without being so fatiguing on the ears. At least that makes sense to me. They sound best turned up loud, and the highs kind of come into their own when you do that. You're going to get plenty of volume from your usual sources (computer, phone, mp3 player), as they're pretty low impedance.I'd say these headphones are best-suited for rock and pop/rap. Synthetic percussion (fake drums) will sound great on these. It's the natural cymbal crashes and stringed instruments that suffer a bit. Classical doesn't sound great here.Thankfully, most of us probably listen to rock and pop type stuff. The highs are a bit rolled off, and the hi-hats and cymbal crashes on my favorite rock songs don't sound exactly lush or crisp, but I've never heard a stereo or headphone that really impressed me as far as that goes.My brother has some Grado SR60i headphones, so he brought those over so I could see how the monoprice stack up. I have to say these are definitely in the same league, no question. The Grados might be a little more crisp, and will give you a wider-sounding stereo field and separation (because they're open), but the bass isn't as satisfying and there's a bit of a mid-range hump in the 1khz range (nasally) that is a bit annoying if you ask me. This isn't really about Grado vs. Monoprice review, I'm just saying these are definitely in the league as headphones that are pushing $100. I honestly can't say how they compare to headphones in the $100+ range because I've never really heard any!With these, I listen at my desk for most of the work day, with my little headphone amp (for volume control and a little extra headroom). My work computer's sound card has a great EQ that lets me boost the highs and mids exactly to my liking. I think some EQing is necessary on these, as the highs are just a little too rolled off. Also for newer recordings the mid-bass (150-200 hz) can get a little muddy at times, and it's a really easy adjustment to take that back down. The "sound stage" is not extremely wide or impressive, but these are closed headphones, so you're kind of limited in that regard. That was a factor in getting these, because I like to listen loudly at my desk without bothering others or having everyone know exactly what I'm listening to.I totally love these headphones and think I might get a second pair so I can just leave one pair at work and one at home so I don't have to cart them around. I love how you can detach the cable. Use whatever sized cord you need and don't worry about ruining the headphones if you trip over the cord or your dog eats it.Which brings me to my only real complaints about these. They're not very mobile, not extremely comfortable (but I do wear them a good 6-7 hours per day without much issue), and you're not going to be able to take these on a jog or to the gym. These are music-first headphones, and you will have to compromise a little at this price range.
When I plugged these into my pc, I was surprised as to the sound clarity! I had been using headphones from walmart and these are far superior! I'm going to buy an extension line to plug into my tv as a sound bar isn't appropriate when living in an apartment with thin walls.
See the end of the review for an update (and why I took the rating from five stars to four).I had read a ton of reviews and opinions about these headphones. I was intrigued as all get-out to try them, even though I didn't think they could possibly be as good as everyone said. Here's the thing--they are. The sound is extraordinary, and I also find them to be very comfortable.First, the sound: I have a pair of the much ballyhooed Audio Technica ATH-M50 cans, and I love them. I've had them for a couple years and used them almost daily and never been disappointed. But for some reason, I really wanted to see how the 8323 would stack up against them. The sound signature is very similar--I would say that they sound 90% as good as the M50. The only differences are that the bass is slightly punchier on the M50 (it has bit more of that visceral bump you can feel in your skull), and the treble is a little brighter. I'm no audiophile, so that's just my layman's impression of the difference. If you switch rapidly back and forth between the two sets of cans as you listen to a favorite track, you will certainly notice that they sound different. But if you listen to the whole track twice (once with each set of cans), you'd be hard pressed to find any qualitative variation.The comfort: This has been exhaustively documented as the Achilles heel of these cans. Many users report that the headband is too tight and that the pads are uncomfortable, either getting sweaty or clamping too tightly around the ears. I don't know how my head compares to yours, but I find them quite comfortable. I was fully prepared to buy the leather headband that people often use with this (here: http://www.amazon.com/Replacement-Leatherette-Universal-Sennheiser-Beyerdynamic/dp/B00862522A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1391096262&sr=8-1&keywords=leather+band+headphones), but I found that I didn't need it. The pressure from the stock headband is only slightly more than what I get from my M50, and I don't notice any uncomfortable pressure points anywhere. I did upgrade to the Beyerdynamic velour pads (EDT-250) that everyone loves, but mostly because I just wanted to try them. They are definitely more comfortable than the stock ones, but that's going to be the case with any cans with vinyl/pleather pads.The other great thing about these phones is the detachable cable. Although the cans already come with two cables (a short, thin one for portable use and a long, thicker one for home use), I went ahead and bought a nice coiled cable that wouldn't get in the way while I'm using them at my computer (here: http://www.amazon.com/Mediabridge-3-5mm-Coiled-Stereo-Audio/dp/B007PE3FC4/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1391096483&sr=8-3&keywords=mediabridge+coiled). I didn't notice a difference in sound quality from using this cable, but the design is perfect for my needs.If you are at all curious about how these cans sound, you owe it to yourself to try them--even if you already have M50s like me!UPDATE: The Mediabridge cable I linked to worked fine for a few months, but I should have gotten a longer one. The slight but constant stress from the tension in the cable (plugged into my computer from slightly too far away) recently caused the plastic to separate around the left ear pad--the side the cable plugs into. The plastic started crumbling off in a domino effect, so I've sadly had to retire these cans. I take off one star because I should have been more careful, but I also feel that the headphones should have help up longer despite the cable tension.
I've had these headphones for over a week now.And for now, I have to say--they're only okay.I had read a lot of the reviews for them here on Amazonand in other places.The reviews were mostly quite positive.Plus at the time I was looking to get them they were sold out-so I saw that as a good thing as well.Anyway--I really wanted to like these but they just aren't cutting it.My first criteria was that whatever I bought had to be 50mm drivers.And I'm honestly finding it hard to believe that these are 50mm.I'm not feeling the power at all.Perhaps it's because I'm listening to music on my Zune player.I don't know.I have it turned all the way up and most songs just sound weak.After reading so many reviews and opinions on headphones, I kind of didn't like when peoplestart throwing in stuff about other headphones.It gets a little distracting.But at the same time I do understand where it would be warranted.You kind of have to compare them to something.So at the risk of sounding like a hypocrite, I kept thinking how the recently brokenPanasonic RPDJS 400K headphones sitting on my couch sounded sooo much better.And they were so cheap on top of that.I got mine at Sears a while back before they closed.It was just a quick desperate purchase one afternoon.My then headphones had shorted out and I needed music for the ride home.I stood there staring at the package, debating in my head if I should get them.I had no idea how they would sound.They were like 30 dollars or so and finally I just said F it and bought them.It turned out to be so well worth it.I was floored by how loud and clear the sound was.I see they're currently available here on Amazon for 19 dollars.Even though the plastic eventually broke apart and I had to use tape to try to keep them together,I should just buy them again since I know how they sound.But I like big, sexy, well designed over-ear headphones.The Sony MDR XD400s that I have are cool lookingand have great sound.But the cord recently shorted all the way out on them as well.I wasn't using it as a jump rope but you'd think they'd make these damn cordsable to stand up to actual physical use.By the way, the smaller/thinner cord that came with the Monoprice headphones seems to,as of this morning, not be working.And that was one of things that made me really pay attention to these Monoprice headphones--the cord being detachable and replaceable.I always get headphones, get into them and then the cord shorts out---every time.It's a joke.All headphone cords should be replaceable.Easily replaceable--as in buying another cord,plugging it in and going on with your day.Not dismantled, soldered and re-taped etc..No matter how many of you say it's easy and only takes 20 minutes,not everyone is handy like that.I'm no audiophile really.But I am very particular about my sound.I like it clean, crisp, clear and LOUD.I listen to quite a bit of music(darkwave, industrial, neo-classical, neo-metal, electronic, ambient, rap, R&B, alternative etc..)walking to and from the train, on the train, walking along the lakefront,as I dance around in my apartment, etc.I am probably even hard on headphones--I take them everywhere.But I like my sound to be Right.I don't have the money to buy 300 dollar cans but even if I did I'd be hesitant.Just because something reads all fancy or looks cooldoesn't mean it'll sound how you'd prefer it to.I have been reading how mps are dependent on how they were ripped and compressed and all that.When I download music files I try to find the largest file sizes.But that being said, the Panasonic played everything loud and clear.These Monoprice cans are mostly just--low.Even the cleaner mps or songs I ripped from my own cd collection just don't sound loud at all.The vocals and music are a little muddled as well.Maybe these are great for some but for me they're just ok.I've been looking at the Sony MDR 7506s--again.They've gotten and constant great and glowing reviews.But I see they are only 40mm.I don't know what to do.
Purchased to replace a pair of Sony over the ear headphones that lost sound in one side (loose wire where it goes into the headphone)I work on computers programming 8+hrs a day and listen to music while I work.  I prefer noise cancelling headphones to help drown out the chatter in an office type setting which can be distracting when you are trying to concentrate.  While these are OK for noise cancellation, they don't drown out 100% of the external sounds if nothing is playing through them.The sound is amazing compared to the Sony's I swapped them out for at half the price.  I had to turn down the volume controls on my computer to about 1/2 the volume required in the Sony's to get the same volume but a much nicer sound.The build quality of the headphones is great compared to the Sony at double the price.  The wire plugs in at the headphone so the cable can be replaced if damaged which is a bonus after what happened to my last pair.  The earpieces are fairly adjustable themselves on a swivel mount and spin on a second axis and fold nicely for storage/travel.  The ear piece padding/cover looks to be decent quality and feel the vinyl is stiff/firm but the padding is soft.My only complaint is the ergonomics, you can lengthen them for larger heads.  I think they examined the force required to make them clamp tight against your ears for the largest head settings, but at the lowest setting for smaller heads causes the things to pinch your head like the jaws of life.  I have tried at all adjustments and they clamp too tight for my liking.If i use them for more than 15-20 minutes I start to get a headache from the clamping force on my ears/side of my head.  Depending on the placement of the earpiece over the ear, it presses so tight on the inner ear cartilage that it causes pain on it as well and you can see an indentation.For reference my head is 57cm/22.5" around forehead to back of head at largest part.  My ears don't stick out more than usual and are appropriate size/shape for my head.I have since put these on the shelf and grabbed a cheap pair of dollar store earbuds, 4+ months of constant headaches gone the day after i stopped using them.  I tried them again one day at home watching netflix (roommates) and the headache/ear pain came back.  I have found i can only use them if i hold one earpiece to the side of my ear without putting it over my head.  It is a shame because the performance is so good, especially for the price yet they are so darn uncomfortable i cannot use them.For reference, I use these at the smallest head size adjustment as seen in the first photo.  Look at how the arc of the top piece flexes/distorts closest to the earpiece when you spread the headphones.  Just at the extended position (Second photo) you can see the top piece is flexing against the bend even at rest.  It takes a good amount of force to spread the headphones with my hands but realize i am taking a photo with my phone in the other.
pros:-very low price, especially if you buy a preowned model like I did.-very respectable audio quality for the price; should be sufficient for low-budget and beginner musicians.-cable is replaceable, a very appreciated feature that even a lot of way higher-end headphones tend to be missingcons:-don't block out outside sound very well, but should be able to at least muffle most typical household background noise.-build quality feels a bit cheap. they don't feel like they're going to fall apart in your hands, but the plastic does tend to rattle and creak when handling them.-not super comfortable, especially not if you wear glasses. headband is barely padded, and they start to pinch on my ears after wearing them for a few hours.if you're solely focused on the performance-to-price ratio, you can do a lot worse than these.
Okay so 4 months after first unboxing these headphones I have enough to write a review.DesignThe headphones are well designed. Hard plastic feels durable but not exactly luxury. For the price, no complains. I"m sure they will last me more than a year or two. The hinges work well and don't ever feel like they are going to break. Headphones fold up well and are decently compact. I love that these headphones allow me to disconnect the cable so I can hook up a longer one or replace it if it gets broken down the road. Most of my headphones have died from cables fraying or breaking. With these headphones you just replace the cable and keep rocking on.SoundI'm not a huge audio guy. I love good sounding music that isn't overwhelming but still noticeable bass. These headphones don't disappoint. They provide incredible sound for $30 headphones and sound just as good as $70 headphones i've tried out. The thing is, the headphones are only as good as the source they are plugged into. Case and point with ear buds I can't hear all the sounds of music on my old iphone but with these I can...even the bad sounds.. so if the quality of the mp3 is bad on my iphone it was really noticeable. Plugged these into my Nokia 928 and then my receiver and they were awesome.External SoundYes they leak a lot of sound. At a good volume to rock out to EDM or Rock n Roll I put a mic next to my head about a foot away and recorded it then played it back later. I could hear the song quite well which shows that while listening at a good volume on the bus is nice, if you don't want to bug people or for people to hear you music you might want to scale it down until you get home.ComfortThey are decent at feeling comfortable. This is probably the headphones biggest weakness. When I scaled my headphones to how I usually do for my head (fitting around my head so they stay on if I move around or jump up and down) they were alright for about an hour but then I noticed I would get bad headaches and a pain in the center of my head. It wasn't until I read another review that said to make them hover over your head that the headaches went away. I have to pull them out 2 clicks from fully out in order to reach comfort though and I don't really have a big head. Before I was able to actually go for a run with the headphones but now they are very lose and will definitely slide if you're not careful. Again, for $30 i'm not surprised and just use them now for sitting at my computer. You have a choice of wearing them only for an hour more securely or for a long time much looser.So would I recommend these headphones? Yup! How do they compare to other headphones? Well they come with two hold plated cables and an adapter for my receiver, they sounds great, and feel durable. Other headphones at $30 can't say that but throw in $20 more and you might get good sounding headphones with more comfort but sacrifice the removeable cord.

My mom is hard of hearing.  She has warn headphones for many years.  We have always liked Sony the best. One year she needed a new set and Sony did not have any available,  so we purchased a different brand... just cant tell you how happy she is to have her Sonys back. The sound quality is much better,  the charge is longer, the comfort, well she walks around the house with them on.. Lol. The last pair of Sonys she had, she wore out the ear cushions! Highly recommend these!
I use these to enable hearing of quieter dialogue found in some TV movies, or to cancel more background noise so that I can actually hear all the dialogue. I have some hearing loss, so the volume control on the earphones is more than adequate if you turn it up. Control is touchy, so be careful you don't set it too loud and hurt your ears. I wish they had larger ear pads, because I can only wear them for a short while without starting to feel considerable discomfort. But better than missing important parts of the movie dialogue, which is often critical to the plot. I bought these "open box" so the cost was less, but function is okay and they charge nicely on the stand. Again, remember... small ears only.
THEY ARE EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED FOR THE PRICE
This wireless headphone and transmitter are the perfect answer for those who are "hard-of-hearing" living and watching TV with those who aren't so as they can listen to a TV program at more normal volume levels while the hard-of-hearing wearer of the headphones can adjust the volume and the audio setting (normal or "voice") to suit their particular needs.  The transmitter and receivers allow "freedom to roam" several rooms away while maintaining the audio signal and - so far anyways - the battery-life seems sufficient.
Just because there Sony I'm very disappointed. There ok. The surround sound sucks. I wouldn't recommend them. Noise cancelling is good.
Listed as new but all packaging had been opened. Looks like all components are present, but definitely not received as a brand new product.
These are good headphones from Sony. I had old version which actually was much more comfortable and better build quality, but Sony does not sell them anymore.These had phones are not bad, yes, they are plasticky , sounds not super great, but for its price it is very good headphones.
I listened very comfortably.
I wear this comfortably over my hearing aids. There was no problem setting the headset up. I charged the battery as instructed and plugged wires into proper slots, having made sure before ordering that our TV outlets matched the headset.  It's wonderful to fully hear dialogue when watching TV with my daughter!
My husband is hearing impaired. These are a god-send!  We use these with our TV and he is able to adjust the headphones to a volume that works for him without having the volume too loud for everyone else! The headphones outlive the material on the ear pieces and as it deteriorates we find little bits and pieces of black plastic stuff that has peeled off. That is our only negative comment.

Most likely you're here on this page because you saw a hype review from a headphone reviewer on YouTube, or someone suggested them on an audiophile forum you were on. In my case, it was Zeos. Can Zeos over-hype things from time to time? Yes, he can. We can also over-hype things to ourselves and find that two weeks later, we're no longer as enchanted as we were the first few weeks after we opened the box. That's why I waited eight months to review these.I own headphones that range anywhere from $30 to $350. I purchased these alongside a pair of DT770 Pros from Beyerdynamic, which I ended up returning. I had purchased the DT770 Pro as a potential working headphone because at that time I was doing a lot of audiobook recording, but on my system, and to my ears, the highs on the DT770 Pro were fatiguing. I am sensitive to enhanced treble, and again, they were a contender for a working headphone. These headphones had to be on my head for several hours per day. My working headphone of choice ended up being the ATH-M40X, which I had to buy an extra headband pad for because they are extremely uncomfortable out of the box, but sounded perfect for monitoring. The DT770 Pro, on the other hand, was like a cloud on my head. Why am I mentioning that on this review, you may ask? Read on.These headphones were more of an experiment than anything else. I was prepared to return them, and had no reservations about doing so, but the way Zeos had described them in his review made me want to experience them for myself. Out of the box, yes, the stock pads are uncomfortable. The sounds is, as many others have said, shockingly good. Knowing my own sensitivity to headphone discomfort, I purchased the Brainwavz pads he recommended in the same order. The ones you're likely to see Amazon recommend as a "buy together" suggestion on this product page. They're $25 dollars, and they're a decent choice. They solve the comfort issue. They make the bass hit harder. What's not to love? Well, I own a pair of Sony MBR-XB500s. Out of everything I've tried, those are the bass headphones of choice, and nothing else I've listened to has come close. I don't need another pair of super slamming bass canons blowing my eardrums out when I was in the mood for that, so what was I to do? Return them? Nay, my friends, this is what I did instead, and what I suggest you do:Still on the closed-back headphones comfort quest, I ordered a pair of Beyerdynamic EDT 770 ear pads, intended to put them on another pair of headphones, that I can't even remember now, because they never made it that far. Out of everything I've tried that is designed for a closed back headphone, these are the most comfortable ear pads I've ever put on my head. They are much more dense than the typical velours, and I wondered if I could make them fit. At first glance, it looked like probably not. I did some internet searching and found that others had managed to stretch them on some slightly larger AKG headphones, so I gave it a shot. It took probably ten minutes the first time I did it, but you can stretch them slowly and carefully to fit these headphones. If you do this, be sure to use the round velvet thin padded disc that comes with them.What you end up with is something truly exceptional. With these ear pads you end up with a sound that isn't the best of class at anything, but close. You get fantastic, punchy bass. You get great mids, and you get clear, but very tolerable treble. Best of all, you now have a headphone you could put on in the morning and probably not have to take off the entire day, at least not for comfort reasons.On top of all of this, these are some of the most responsive headphones to EQ I've personally tried. You can EQ brain obliterating bass into them, if that's what you insist on, and they will absolutely deliver it. Ear bleeding treble? If that's what you want (seek help), they'll give it to you no questions asked. I'm not sure how this works. Maybe it's the size of the driver, and the spaciousness the large openings give, the combination of the two, or something completely different. All I know is that I have not experienced these drastic changes on other headphones, out of the dozen or so I own or have owned.As for cons, I really hate this cord. It's way too long for a cord that isn't detachable. That's it. They're $30, and I can't think of anything else I dislike about them. I've been using them for eight months, and I've really tried to find things wrong with them. There just isn't.Although not a con, I will give you a small warning on the power it takes to drive these. These sounds noticeably better when you have the power to drive them. On my phone, they don't blow me away, so I don't use them on my phone. For that I use Sony WH-1000XM3s, but it's an apples to oranges comparison overall so I won't make it. For my built in motherboard sound output, they were fine. For my daily use they stay plugged into a Sound BlasterX G6, and sound, as I said before, exceptional.So what would I recommend you use them for? Well, anything that isn't portable. I've listened to a huge variety of music on these, from EDM to classical, and probably anything else you can think of. Exceptional. For gaming? Exceptional. Note that I am not a competitive gamer, but with how these respond to EQ, I'm sure they could be tuned for excellent footstep depth and direction. The huge space inside these create some kind of magic. I play mostly single player games, including games with a big focus on music and environmental atmosphere, like Witcher 3. They are just unmatched. I'm sure something in that $350+ price range beats them. I know they're not "the best headphone".On that note, and to my final point: Let's step back a minute and recognize something you may have forgotten as you read this. These are $30, and they're know to go on sale from time to time. About $65 total if you buy them at regular price with the Beyerdynamic pads. They are the cheapest headphones I own. They make me scared to spend money on more expensive headphones, out of fear I'll be disappointed.Buy these. You will not be disappointed.
First thing is first, the biggest thing to take away from this, is "IT'S $30". You cant expect god-tier stuff at $30, even my personally touted $30USD Koss KPH30i is obviously not the best thing since sliced bread, but I think I found the polar opposite, sound profile-wise in the Monoprice Modern Retro. It seems like there are a bunch of polarizing opinions on this pair of cans, many people hold these up there with well made cans in the hundreds of dollars, while others are trashing on it "because its $30". I think people need to take a step back and look at things with context.This is all from the perspective of a casual audiophile, I don't claim to have golden hearing, nor to understand everything down to the minute detail. I just know what I like, and what I tend to look for in the sound from a headphone.Build: DecentThe packaging is very simplistic, but I think that is fine for a $30 pair of headphones, nothing but a cardboard box, with a cardboard insert holding things in place inside, with the sensitive parts covered with plastic bags. It does the job, and it holds it securely in place, with enough room to allow for bumpy shipping to beat on the box with no worries. The cable is standard fair, with a rubberized nylon coating, somewhat easy to kink, though its not super stiff at the least. It is nice that they include a 1/4 inch to 3.5mm screw-on converter with the cable, that is really appreciated. The cable is permanently attached, no swapping. There is some stress relief built in. The headphones themselves are pretty much purely plastic. the cups are hard plastic, somewhat cheap feeling. The headband is a pair of hard nylon rods, it does the job fine. the headrest at the top is nice and wide, it adjusts as you put the headphones on. The tension for the headband is done via a pair of spandex cords, so I can see that wearing out in the future. For the earcups, they have some up-down movement that is allowed, but no front or back, instead, that relies on the nylon of the headband to flex. The clamp force is mild, not skull crushing like some closed back headphones. The pads are replaceable I believe. They are ok. They arent soft, but they arent rock-hard either. I am impressed by their build for $30, I have seen much worse examples.Sound: Competently GoodThis is where I think the Monoprice Modern Retro shines. When listening to this, of course, I am not blown away by anything specific, but I remember that these are $30, and that context makes them impressive. The overall sound signature is a heavy leaning towards warm, with what seems to be average mids and highs. Imaging is mediocre, you can easily tell the direction of most sounds, and get a decent sense of generally where a sound is coming from, likely due to the lack of any emphasis on the treble. Their soundstage is moderate, as they are a closed back set of headphones. There is an obvious soundstage, but it doesnt reach very far. Instrument separation is fine, its there, but it does not make itself very obvious. For the sound in general, bass is very good, the drivers do a good job of trying to hold it together when the bass hits, I have heard many a cheap pair of headphones that are a garbage with bass, where it just feels like a wobbly mess. It's not crisp and fast with the bass, but it does the job decently, which is far better than many other $30-50 "big name" *cough* Beats *cough* headphones that I have heard. The driver holds itself together when you get big bass hits, and even when you have very rapid bass. The mids are average, maybe a bit recessed, bass mostly keeps to itself, so it doesnt encroach much on the mids I feel, unlike some other, less competent headphones. You will hear the guitar and male vocals, but they never pop at you. The treble is also average, at least to me. Female vocals are relatively clear, and you can hear high-notes, but there isnt any sparkle like in an obviously V-shaped set of headphones. There are times where the way it handles treble, it does kind of fall apart, sounding harsh. Overall, this is a very warm sound, with decent performance as a whole. If I had to explain how I would say it sounds in a somewhat simple way, I would say, "It's what a pair of Beats headphones at this price SHOULD sound like, if they actually put money into the parts, instead of advertising."In the end, the Monoprice Modern Retro, factoring the price, is an amazingly competent set of headphones. If you are looking for a warm closed back set of headphones that are far in away, an amazing performer for the price of $30, really, they are an easy recommendation from me. I feel like they are a good option if you are new to the audiophile hobby, and want a cheap starter "fun" set of headphones.Edit: adding a few images.
While these headphones won't excite an audiophile, if you want to spend as little as possible on a set of headphones but not make too many concessions with regard to comfort and sound quality, this is the set to get. For $25 you get headphones that sound way better than you would expect for the price point, and are also pretty comfortable to wear for extended periods.The build quality is OK. Again, these are $25 headphones, but they are pretty decently made. They will not stand up to rough handling, but as long as they are treated with care, they will provide a good service life. The earpads are comfortable and do a good job of blocking out ambient noise. It has an attached cord that has both a 1/4 inch and a 3.5mm jack. You have to screw off the 1/4 inch one to expose the 3.5mm one. While I like the convenient way it provides 2 different jacks, I would have much preferred to have a detachable cord. But again, for the price, it's not a deal killer by any means.The sound quality for the price is excellent. No, it doesn't sound as good as a $200 set, but it's reasonably clear, decently punchy, and doesn't significantly distort at high volumes.If you're looking for the best value in a headphone, it's hard to beat this. Five stars.
I have gone deep dive into the headphones arena.....I have 10 pairs now.  Here's what I can say.Straight out of the box I was super impressed.Not lacking in bass....infact, these are the boomiest of all my headphones.  This is an endearing quality to these cans in my humble opinion.  The treble detail is there and they do seem to be balanced.  The treble is not harsh as many good headphones may be accurate, but the treble just isn't harsh at all.  Accurate is not always good imo.  The treble has good clear definite detail.  I do wish the vocals were a tad more upfront as they do get overtaken by other aspects, but not swallowed up either....just wish vocals were a little more present like Sony MDR-7506.  Unlike the Sony Studio phones these do sound like headphones as the sounds kind of come from all around, but in good enjoyable mix.  The Sony Studio is out of all my headphones the most similar to listening to 2 channel stereo with open air speakers.  I do feel that these cans are lightweight and comfortable since I can compare to Phillips L2's which to me are so lightweight and comfortable I can wear those for hours.  I am using a headphone amp and these things are pretty impressive, but they do not compare to my $150 - $200 headphones with an amp.  They just aren't as clear as some of the drivers on my other headphones.  That being said they are definitely better than my DJ headphones and very enjoyable, but definitely do not replace my more expensive headphones just being honest.  However, for $30 I am impressed, very impressed by the overall product.  They do not sound like $150 or $30 headphones.  This is a tough one to quantify.  For example,  I have been listening to 80's & 90's rock on these and it's quite an experience one that my other headphones have not delivered.  To relegate these to my spare left in my car would be a bit of crime which was the original intention.  And, to replace my $150+ headphones would be a big ask and a bit devastating to my audiophile ears/ego.  Anyway, these are every bit worth buying and trying them out to see if they meet with your approval even if used without amp and tone controls of any kind still a delight.
First time I've ever literally had my jaw drop from a pair of headphones, and that's aside from the price! Came across Z's review of these and the hype is real! REPLACING THE PADS WITH THE BRAINWAVS XL (Sheepskin or Pleather) is A MUST! Brainwavz XL Large Replacement Memory Foam Earpads - Suitable For Many Other Large Over The Ear Headphones - Sennheiser, AKG, HifiMan, ATH, Philips, Fostex, Sony (Black Pleather) The pad upgrade alone makes these instantly within the same class as $500 dollar headphones and up, I did a/b tests with the akg 712, audeze lcd-2, and it's convinced me to return my akg 702's for a refund because these are THAT GOOD.A couple caveats at this price I will explain below1. Aside from the essential pad upgrade already mentioned, get an amp with these, i would consider it almost as essential to make these sing to the high heavens, at 32ohms these are really easy to drive without an amp but with an amp and wow, and you don't need an expensive one, the A3 from Fiio ($60) will drive these like a champ and blow your mind.2. The cable is extremely long and is permanently attached, very loosely at that, seems like it would be easy to accidentally get the cord caught on something and yank it out, which would require soldering and disassembly to repair, there are mods to install a female jack onto these to make the cable detachable, google "monoprice retro cable mod". I found a small work-around to this by applying a little bit of super glue in the small gap that is between the cable and the housing to create a filling that stops the cable attachment from wiggling around loosely there. any sort of adhesive/epoxy or squeezable glue should do just as good of a job,Other than that, you are good to go! As far as the sound goes: I had just purchased a pair of k702's which I will use as a comparison since the 702's and the AKG brand are highly regarded as the industry standard in my profession, they sound GREAT if you are using them for what they are made for: critical listening/mastering/mixing, i work as a producer/engineer in the music industry so i have cans on my head 8 hours a day, the soundstage is amazing on the k702's but as many said, they felt underwhelmed by the lack of low end, I disagree and heard and felt plenty of low end, my problem with the 702's is how sensitive they are, they need to be at a less than "loud" volume to find the sweet spot with no distortion, and even response, but they are very quick to distort no matter what amp i used (O2, magni3, Fiio) I sense the lack of bass felt from many can be due to the open back design which lets air escape and to compensate we turn up the volume to get the low end pumping to match the pristine mids/highs and wide sound stage the 702's have, that being said, they are an amazing pair of headphones and deserve all the praise they have you just can't crank em.Now on these....since they have a almost identical form factor aside from being closed back and not open.they can keep up with everything i threw at them so far, even tried purposely double-amping a couple amps to try and get these to distort to see how much they could take and you would get hearing damage before you would hear clipping from these assuming your source is good (flac, 320mp3).I wish monoprice would hook up AKG with some pointers on how to get them to sound like these, I wanted to like the akg's so badly, but alas they have been bested by something a fraction of the price, and i'm on the fence if the "burning in" myth is a factor but if thats the case then i can't imagine the monoprice retros can even sound better than they already do!It's interesting how small changes in headphones are the difference between hundreds of dollars in cost, there are numerous models of headphones from numerous brands out there that are marketed as the company's flagship product and priced as such yet contain the same driver as the cheaper models and the only difference is tweaks to the housing/build to change the sound signature, so you end up paying hundreds more for a piece of foam added behind the earpad of a model half the price to accentuate the bass/change the mids, etc.However, with these its as if the opposite happened, as if they just "downgraded" their higher end models by swapping out the earpads for really low grade pads which changes the sound from night to day,All this is within hours of receiving them in the mail, so I will update this review if things change:TL;DR1. Get Brainwavs XL Pleather or Sheepskin replacement pads (ESSENTIAL)2. Cable is too long and NOT removable and is attached poorly at that, mods can be done.3. If 1 and 2 are completed you will have possibly the best $30 dollar headphones ever made, period.
Yes, replacement earpads that cost as much as the headphones are worth it.It's the one area they feel cheap.They are totally serviceable as they are, but seriously...
I'll get sound quality out of the way and then talk about why these headphones are a great bargain. They are rather unintimate mid-bass heavy with an overall recessed signature and uneven treble as well as other variables that make these feel hard to feel engaged with in a lot of areas; they are quite average in sound quality from stock, lacking some body, clarity, separation, stage, imaging, etc, but are just okay, and aren't refined at all, and unlike their cousins, they are closed-back instead of semi-open and/or open, which can be good or bad based upon your preference. So, what makes these worth the price?I'll start with build quality. This is very subjective in the matter, in fact, most people have criticized the build on these as being "cheap", but in my opinion, they are made out of good quality materials, especially if you want to go and compare other headphones for the same price. They aren't designed with complexity, but have sturdy yet flexible parts despite being lightweight and "cheap" feeling; they don't have many parts that can break because of their simple design without many joints and lack of a foldable or collapsible structure, hard ABS-like plastic, earcups with minimal up and down swivel, and a thick, solid, nicely stitched pleather headband pad well-balanced and suspended by some spring action on the sides and a "roll cage" aka outer headband on top supporting the overall flexibility of the unit and compensating for the lack of side swivel of the earpads as well; they literally just sit on your ears with some slight adjustments, and being lightweight not only makes them have better comfort potential, but also makes them durable from accidental drops and occasional dangles aside from its ABS/ABS-like materials and flexible outer headband contorting to certain angles from mishandling or slight impact. I believe the durability and quality is underestimated mainly because of their lightweight design and hard-wired cable, which I feel isn't bad either, since the cable is dense with a quality 3.5mm male plug at the end; a detachable cable would have just been a bonus on top. The only real quality complaint I have is the stock earpads, which are firm and shallow, causing slight discomfort. They use the AKG aka SuperLux aka Samson signature design, and this is a good thing, which leads me to my next point.Pad moddable. Yes, if you want to use a variety of large pads, like ones for AKGs and other popular headphones that share similar earpads, this inexpensive pair of headphones allows you to do just that, so you can customize your comfort, and sound to some degree, and yes, sound does change with different pads; I'm sure with such a basic design, other mods can be done as well. This really is like a starter DIY headphone that's just decent out of the box.If you aren't sure if you'd like the design of the more expensive Samson, Superlux or even AKG headphones with this similar design concept, this is a great one in my opinion for testing the waters, since for its price, there's nothing to lose, and you get the bonus of having the same moddable pad options as its more expensive cousins, or, if you just want an inexpensive full-sized decently built headphone with huge 50mm drivers at such a very reasonably low price, you cannot go wrong. Buy multiple pairs and customize them with different pads and mods for each one; it's a cool project.These get my recommendation!
OK I own a lot of headphones compared to most normal people and I LOVE Bass.  These $20 Monoprice Modern Retros just blew my mind for actual BASS QUANTITY.  Bass Extension is average, so don't expect it to reach the lowest frequencies if that's what you want.  If you like EDM and Hip Hop and love BASS THUMP these can actually deliver with enough sound pressure to create the rumble in your ears and brain.  I have it hooked up through a vintage receiver that has enough power to drive my Audeze LCD-2 Classics and my Sennheiser HD6xx @300 ohms so I'm impressed that the Modern Retros do not distort easily.  I would say more Bass Quantity than my Philips Fidelio X2HR, Less Quantity than my Audeze LCD-2, More than Beyerdynamics DT-770 Pro, More than Creative Aurvana Live, as far as I've tested VMODA LP-2 are the loudest/strongest bass headphones I have heard although they sound terrible in the mids/treble.This is definitely a V-Shaped sound so critical listeners will not be pleased, but if you want some fun headphones to listen to modern music then here you go.  The mids are definitely recessed, but the nice thing is the Treble doesn't get too sibilant which is surprising.  I boosted the 20hz frequencies on my EQ +15 db and these headphones will THUMP.  Bass is not the cleanest and anyone looking for critical bass response may be disappointed and yes if you are looking for it you will hear bass bleed into the midbass, but who cares if you are enjoying the song.Soundstage and Imaging are surprising for these headphones.  It is much wider than I would have thought and the headphones do a good job letting you hear where things are at least left to right.  Really fun for movies especially for the explosion sound effects in movies.  It's also very fun for gaming and really helps create an immersive experience with decent ability to pinpoint sounds in a 3d space.  These probably aren't the best for REALLY competitive FPS gamers, but most gamers won't be complaining about these headphones.  If you need every advantage you can get for FPS games, then I'm assuming you're also willing to pay the $$$ for that advantage.Cons are the cheap build, the crazy long fixed cable, and the terrible earpads.  If you know how to solder you can mod these for a detachable cable and the earpads are an easy upgrade.  Other really good headphones in this price range are the Koss KSC75, Koss Porta Pro, Koss KPH30i, Creative Aurvana Live!, and the BLON BL-03 IEMs.
On a budget?  Don't despair...Monoprice Retros are here!  To begin with, I don't think anyone expects budget Monoprice phones to last more than a year.  Their plastic build materials are not meant to be permanent.  That was so for my 8323 model.  After about a year of steady use...doink!  The left speaker cracked and broke off right at the attachment to the headband.  I decided to replace them with the Monoprice 116150 Retro model.  As recommended by others I modified them with some XL Brainwavz memory foam pads.  The phones are very light and feel great with the new pads.  But on to the sound.  Need extra bass?  These have it.  And if not as detailed and pure-sounding as costlier phones they are more than adequate.  The mids are okay and the highs can be a bit rugged on the ear at louder volumes.  I'm in the earlier stages of sampling different kinds of music, but so far, I'm impressed.  I'm not sure you can beat them for $26.99.It would be unfair to compare them to the many excellent headphones I have:  Sennheiser 660S, Audio-Technica Air 1000, Audio-Technica M40, Philips Fidelio X2hr, Philips SHP 9600, Fostex T50 and others.  They are not really meant to compete with those models in head-on combat.  But if you are tight on cash and need a solid set this might be the way to go.Sampled so far:  Tim Timmermans - Seven Bridges (lots of trumpet and deep bass)Richard Strauss - Also Sprach Zarathustra (music used in 2001, a Space Odyssey) - Rudolf Kempe/Staatskapelle Dresden (the phones do very well with many lower string passages)Maurice Ravel -  Ma Mere L'Oye (Charles Dutoit/Montreal Symphony Orchestra)Pat Metheny Group - The Road to YouPaul & Linda McCartney - Uncle Albert/Admiral HalseyQueen - A Night at the Opera: Bohemian RhapsodyDonald Fagen - The Nightfly - I.G.Y.; Walk Between the RaindropsDennis Rollins - 11th Gate - Samba Galactica (cymbals incredibly clear)To sum up:Build quality - ehSound stage -  super at this priceHighs - can be a little shrillMids - so-soBass - pronouncedPrice - can't beat it
This review is for the "Modern Retro Over Ear Headphones"; this listing has apparently been used for other products as well before.I finally broke down and reluctantly bought a pair of headphones to replace the Realistic headphones I bought from Radio Shack in about 1983... not so much because they needed replacement but because I lost faith that they would be able to persevere. After all, they're 37 years old. How long can they possibly be excellent?After much deliberation and a great deal of comparison shopping (I'm bad that way), I settled on these headphones as my substitute. Upon using them... I'm both impressed and unimpressed. Mostly impressed, I think.They're astoundingly lightweight, and the very large earpads surround my ears very well. I have a set of Dumbos, and it takes a lot of headphone to fully surround them. These do that. They're also very soft, so I can wear them comfortably for several hours at a time. Their frequency response curve sounds very, very flat across the spectrum, with good solid bass, crisp highs, and full midrange.BUT... they're not perfect. I DON'T like their rather extreme flexibility; they're a bit like a Slinky. I'd prefer that the headband was more rigid, so that the earpads always remained more or less diametrically opposed to each other. I have no reason to want to tie these things in a knot.I'm also not overly fond of the fact that they close up fully like a disturbed pillbug when they're off your head, so the earpads rub against each other as you handle them. I'm convinced that this will result in undue wear to the bottom edges of the earpads, that resulting in a reduced life of the headphones. I cannot believe that these will last nearly as long as my old Realistic headphones have so far.Third, I'd prefer a coiled headphone cord over a straight headphone cord. I cannot make this cord stay out of the way of my chair's wheels; I'm constantly running over it. That was never much of a problem with my older 'phones with the coiled cord. I'm very strongly tempted to replace this cord with a good coiled cord.Overall... these are good headphones, and well worth the money to me. There's room for improvement, but I'd still buy them a second time and recommend them to any friend.

Panasonic makes the best on-ear wired old-style headphones. Sound quality is the best
para el precio buen producto
My wife loves these over-the-ear headphones but inevitably breaks them by sleeping on them or whatever. The sound is pretty good but they are not the most robust physical construction. Anyway, buying them by the 5-pack saves money and keeps spares on-hand.
these were the best sound of headsets that were comfortable to fall asleep on.
Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS is the Best headphones on the market in 2021. I have been using these for several years now. The five pack is great because you never know when one will get damaged. These headphones are excellent for listening to high quality music and for composing music. The Frequency Response is 16Hz - 22kHz. This is the frequency response you need. You could also buy headphones with a frequency response of 12Hz - 26kHz. But Do Not buy headphones with a frequency response of 20Hz - 20kHz unless all you want to hear is bass. I highly recommend these headphones not only because of the low price but also because of the excellent quality and frequency response.
I have been ordering these for years.  I usually don't buy so many but this was a good deal. they usually last a year.  very lightweight and comfortable.
Audio from tablet and laptop with fan blowing in my face.
Item Description: set of 5 basic headphones.Pros: comfortable. quality sound for affordable price & low enough profile for me to use while falling asleep with my head on a pillow watching a movie.Cons: none unless you are a sound snob. I once spoke with an owner of a vintage vinyl record shop & they said that unless you have hyper-sensitive hearing, most sound quality claims by any speaker manufacturer is mostly nonsense.Suggestions to manufacture: noneWould I buy again or as a gift? yesDid I receive anything for this review? NO! I paid full price for this item.
Great price
My family if very rough on headphones -- they are frequently packed down into backpacks, taken on numerous trips, and in use most of the day.  For me, a pair of these lasts me years and I find them very comfortable, so I keep a set at my desk at both work and at home.We've used cheaper headphones, but many of them don't last a week. And I stay away from earbuds because of concerns around them regarding hearing loss.These last a fair amount of time and aren't expensive. I just order a box and when I run out, order another box.

Great Sound and good for workout
I bought these to replace my Motorola SF200 Sports Headphones. They perform the same functions, and I will use this review as a comparison between the two.Pros:Have an adjustable ear clip to accomodate those with "longer" ears.  This is not necessarily an issue for me.The in-ear speakers are not silicone "buds" that you shove into your ear.  They are plastic and they are meant to sit outside the ear.  I think that because of this they draw more power from the mp3 player and are much louder than the SF200s.  Although they are not as comfortable as the silicone buds, they don't pop out of place like the buds do.The microphone/button function the same as the SF200s, with a single button for call answer/pause (1-click), and next/previous track (2-click, 3-click).The microphone picks up audio very well.Cons:The headphones are made of cheap flimsy plastic.  This must be where the $7 difference is between this product and the SF200s.  I don't know how long they'll last. I've had the SF200s for a year now and have been through many many hours sweat and rain.  I don't know if the JVCs will hold up as long, but we'll see.The 3.5mm jack is straight, as opposed to angled.  Thus, it sticks out of players much farther than an angled chack, such as that of the SF200.  This isn't "bad" in any way, but if I were ever pressed for space near a headphone jack, these most likely won't fit.If you were to ask me if I would prefer the SF200s or the JVCs, I'm not sure which I would choose.  Probably the JVCs since they are $7 cheaper, and I really did not like the fit of the SF200s in my ear - the silicone would always come loose and pop out while I was running.  Furthermore, fresh ear wax would build up inside of the buds, and the JVCs don't have that problem.  However, the SF200s are entirelly cased in flexible silicone/rubber material (even the wire), so there is no worry of something cracking or breaking.  I only replaced them because they got a little too wet one day and the button signal would send to the player at random times, pausing my music or skipping to the next/previous track uncontrollably.  If the SF200s would switch from the silicone earbuds towards the plasic ones that won't pop out, then I would definitely switch back.
I have used the JVC HA75 version for about ten years; they are almost identical to these, except they don‚Äôt have the sound adjustment.  I like the headphone style because they sit on your ear and don‚Äôt clamp your head in a vise. The speakers sit outside your ear without cramming rubber in your ear canal.  And the earpieces don‚Äôt hurt my ears after hours of use. They don‚Äôt need to be charged or connected to bluetooth , and I have dragged them all over the house without any signs of wear or deterioration.So why did I get these?  I wanted a second pair for another tablet so I didn‚Äôt have to move them back and forth when I wanted to use them. They come in different colors so you can differentiate them from each other. And‚Äîbonus‚Äîthe 80‚Äôs have better sound!  They are louder, clearer, and have more bass response. I‚Äôm not talking front-row at the symphony, but enough to tell a significant difference.This is a product where I will buy a second pair as a backup, then the fool device companies will stop making earphone jacks‚Ä¶
I have been using this style of JVC headphones for more than a decade to listen to audio books on an MP3 player (Sansa Clip Plus/Sport), so when I needed to replace my current pair (they do have a finite lifetime) I saw this model with a remote control, I thought it would be great to push a switch to silence the audio so I to talk to a person on my walks.  I did not realize till I got them and read the included manual that the remote is only good for iPod and IPhone or Blackberry devices. So, if you want a cheap good set of phone get the JVC without the switch for a couple of dollars less.  They are great for audio books.
Here's the problem with these headphones:  They simply don't last very long.  You'd be lucky if you could get 8-12 months of use!  However, the reason I've purchased a total 43 pairs (since 2012) and the reason I still rate them 4-stars is because of Sound Quality, Comfort, and Price.  I've searched high and low and I haven't found any over-the-ear clip-style headphones that are this comfortable.  Other headphones start to hurt, or fall off of my ear, or both.  These JVC Sport headphones stay put, and they stay put comfortably.  Then there is the sound quality.  I am by no means an audiophile, but I can clearly hear that these headphones sound better to me than any others within this same class, style, and price range.  The sound is deep, robust, and crystal clear!Unfortunately, the headphones are physically delicate and you shouldn't expect to have them for a full year without them structurally breaking or, more likely, without them losing sound in one ear (which is their most common problem)... but overall, if you can buy them for under $10 USD or maybe attach a third party warranty to them, then they'll be well worth their flaws while you have them.  If you can find better comfort and sound than this at $10 or less, please let me know.  I'm always looking! :-)I may have purchased a lot of these headphones since 2012, 4 of them I just purchased new this month (Sept 2019)... but once these 4 all break, I can tell you now, I'm probably going to stock up and buy more after that.Pro Tip: If you do buy these headphones, keep them in a protective case or something when you aren't using them.  They still won't last "long" but they'll at least last longer.
I bought each of my boys a pair of these for school this year and they have both told me they work really well and that they want a set for at home.Looks like I need to order a couple more pairs!
I have used a lot of different earbuds over the years. But these are the bomb. They sit perfectly on your channel and not stuck in your ear with little rubber things. They sound great and they're perfect for running and running. I like that they are on a cord so when they fall out of your ear you don't lose them. Perfect. Great job.
I use one old android phone (without an account) and an old ipod touch for my music, audiobooks, and podcasts. I have my headphones in from when I wake to when I sleep unless I'm with loved ones or at work. I needed a pair of comfortable headphones that would stay in/on and preferably with in-line controls so I wouldn't have to dig out my devices and fumble with the controls while cooking, cleaning, painting, video gaming, or whatever.Pros:Extremely comfortable: The over the ear loops are generous and extend to fit ears I don't think I've ever seen on a person. They're light and don't irritate the channel just outside the ear, unlike my old ipod headphones. I often forget I'm wearing them and will snag them when taking off clothes because they're still in.The play/pause button: That's all I use it for, stop and go music. It's responsive and as long as the programming is in your device (androids handle this input in strange ways) the selected audio will respond accordingly.Good sound: I'm not a sound-phile, I don't really know what I'm listening to. I have, however, cranked up my music with no ill effect and the odd speaker 'cover' seems to direct more sound directly into your ear canal. I've lowered the volume on my devices since the snug fit provides much better output.Cons:No volume control: So close.... so close. I just can't seem to find a set I like that also have that feature, but it's a minor concern.Play/pause button: It is extremely sensitive. I've had music and other audio kick on and off unexpected when my headphones were plugged in and the strap from my bag hit the thing or I've brushed it too hard. I've set the headphones and device coiled next to me and heard strange, distant talking, not realizing what was going on for a minute or two, only to find I'd leaned and clicked the button again.Overall: If you need comfortable headphones that are affordable, get 'em. The play/pause button is a nice, if slightly overzealous, feature. But as always, if you want more, you have to spend more.
I love JVC products, they have impecable sound, however, for me personally I can't wear these. I've tried several different times but the ear pieces are made of a hard plastic and really hurt. That's the only negative from giving it 5 stars.
Overall, these aren't terrible, but they aren't so good either.The adjustable clip is so loose and moves back and forth with gravity. It SHOULD be clicking into different positions and staying in that position until moved with a bit more intentional pressure. Even so, the fact that it's loose isn't as bad as the fact that the clip is in line with the earbud, meaning that it doesn't secure to the ear very well. As I try to put the clip around my ear and then push the earbud in, the clip slips off my ear. If I try to put the earbud in my ear first, putting the clip around my ear makes the earbud fall out.My last gripe is that the size of the earbud is too big for my ear, but that's more of a me problem. I have small ears.The sound quality is fine though, the button works, and overall it's certainly usable. The quality of the product is just not worth the price in my opinion. This thing is cheap.

I have purchased these before, but this most recent time the sound quality is drastically worse than any other time I have purchased them. I had an older set of this exact brand/type (also purchased via Amazon) that was wearing out and compared it against the new pair I just bought. The old, glitching set sounded much better than the new one, which was very tinny and soft. I'm incredibly disappointed in the decrease in quality.
Compr√© este segundo par para m√≠ hijo, para que los use para viajar y los primeros para clases virtuales. Son muy duraderos.
These ear buds barely stay in place. The foam on one of them was not on the bud but I put it there. A few minutes later it fell off again.  The sound quality is no good. I'm not expecting hi-fidelity but even for just watching sports or shows they're no good. I was looking to replace the ear buds that came with my Samsung Galaxy phone. I will try to find Samsung ear buds.
I use these to go jogging and they get tossed around alot without ever seeming to become damaged. Great price for a great product.
When the product came apart and an attempt was made to try to pop it back together, it broke completely. Is there a way to get a free replacement?Please advise.
Earbuds are really a personal preference item. Some that other people love you might hate those, but for me and my son these are great. I like to wear them and just get to work so I do not want earbuds that come out super easy. These you rotate when you put them in and they move into place and that makes them stay in better.  They are not squishy like some brands and if you want that these are not for you.
Love price n product
They took longer than expected to come and are made of cheap quality one headphone already messed up would not recommend
My old ones were going bad. I'm glad I found same one like my old ones.
Huge ear pieces even for adults.

I bought these headphones to replace the original Wireless crushers I bought a few years back. These headphones are the most base intensive headphones I've ever owned. One review I saw compared the base from these headphones and compared them to being kicked in the head by a mule, he was not wrong. The packaging is understated and well thought out the headphones come with a hard shell case usb-c charging cable headphone jack cable and the headphones themselves. The fit and finish of this unit is impressive. I bought the black headphones and they are understated slick and look very nice. While these headphones are heavy they are not prohibitively so. The clamp Force on my head is nice I do not worry about these headphones falling off as I do yard work or work out. The noise canceling is decent. While they are not as active as the Bose qc2 these headphones block out a lot of the Ambient sound. With sound canceling on I do not feel like I'm in a tunnel or have the pressure effect often associated with active noise canceling. My listing environment is noisy as my house is on a busy road and my Aquarium produces a fair bit of sound. The filter noise from my aquarium is all but locked out however I can still hear dripping sounds from the filters. In addition when the ANC is on there is an audible hiss similar to a cassette tape. This hiss is not noticeable when sound from music or other media is played back through this headset. I do not find the hiss annoying but it is sad that Skullcandy couldn't work around this issue.The first thing I did after opening the package was turn on the headphones and paired them with my tablet. Pairing mode is very simple and quick and I had no problems with playback. I opened up YouTube and played a song by the Black Eyed Peas with the bass turned all the way up. Let me tell you that was an experience. After listening to the song I played around with the base slider and found that songs that already have a lot of bass don't need a lot of help from these headphones and I turn the base slider down near to the bottom. Songs however that don't have a lot of bass I was able to have the slider up much higher and found it to be a very enjoyable experience. I played Pachelbel's Canon in D with piano and cello and found with the base turned up I was able to hear the low notes on the piano and found that it sounded like a live performance what I mean is the haptic base vibrations made the piano feel as if it was in the room with me. I then listened to a few tracks that I really like from Mannheim Steamroller and Kurt bester playing with with the bass slider to find the best sound environment. Listening to music with these headphones is dynamic and Rich and I found myself becoming emotional while listening to favorite tracks. Other reviews complain about the mids and the highs not being reproduced well however I prefer these headphones to my Bose qc2 for music. The reason being I can adjust exactly how much bass I want in my music. While there is an app that helps the user customize their listening preferences I found I did not need to do so. While the Bass on these headphones is haptic meaning there is a mechanical vibration that activates with low frequencies the effect is like having a subwoofer moving air in the listening environment. The haptic Bass as well as the low register from the earphones themselves makes music come alive. Most people are saying that this headset is only for bass heads, but those people are missing the point of this headphone. Sure the user can turn the bass up all the way and make their teeth rattle and it's kind of fun to do that once in awhile, the reality is this headset allows the user to customize their listening preferences in a way that is unavailable from any other headset. I find the reproductions of the high and the mid-range to be decent bright and clear and with the bass slider I can customize and have full control of exactly how much Bass I want while listening to music.I recorded this review using the microphone on the headphones. I found that my voice sounded natural and not muted as one would expect from ANC monitor headphones. Having the microphone built in is a nice touch. I think these would be great for playing games even though there is not a boom mike like most gaming headphones this shows a boom mic is not necessary when playing games. This partly justifies the price of this headset as it can be used for gaming phone calls and for listening to music. Additionally this headset comes with the tile feature built in. If you are worried about losing your headphones or leaving them at the coffee shop or not being able to locate them which was the case for my original crushers and necessitated the replacement, the tile feature will help you locate where your headphones are and works very well.While this headset is not for everyone I find it is quickly becoming my go-to headset. The only downside is this headset went on sale the day after I ordered it. I did contact Amazon only to find that they no longer guarantee lowest price and I was out of luck. This is not acceptable when one considers the price of Amazon Prime and soured the experience when buying these headphones.In conclusion I would recommend these headphones for anyone who wants an immersive sound experience. Not only is the build quality the fit and finish and feel of these headphones impressive, they're also feature rich with app support and support for the tile feature built in this is a good choice for those who use headphones and are looking for an immersive experience.
I thought I'd gotten a defective pair.  The bass boost wasn't working at all.  Turns out - they were just too low on charge and once I'd left them charging overnight - they worked fine.  They sound downright amazing when you get that bass boost dialed in.  It's got so much that about somewhere in the 1/2 range is about right - anything more and it just ruins the music.
Can't charge while using an audio jack. It will charge while using it for blue tooth mode. While using for Bluetooth mode the volume isn't as loud as it is for audio jack mode. Sound quality is good for both models. If you want to use with a PC and be able to charge at the same time have to buy a blue tooth USB device. The headphones are comfy and have plenty of room for the ears to fit inside. I set the bass near the lowest settings. Turning it up further creates unatural pulsing on the ears. Volume increases or decreases are in 10 percent increments. Its not gradual as turning up the dial on a set of computer speakers.
Had them for a while now, use them for lifting. When I got them the earphone part was loose. The bass is crazy and sound is good. I‚Äôve charged them twice sense I‚Äôve got them and I‚Äôve had them for around 2 months.
I loved the headphones great extreme bass but Amazon did a horrible job at delivering this product it was raining and they left it right outside in the rain and I had a mailbox which can fit in but luckily me I was able to get it in time before it got very wet and damaged my headphones
Love EDM?! Body vibrating BASS?! Want to feeeeel the music? These headphones are made for you! The haptic bass is really something else, nothing like it outside of these headphones. Even the Skullcandy Crusher Evo's don't get as bassy - I know, I tried both side by side for days. I also bought and tested the Sony WM-1000XM4. Here are my thoughts of all 3 models:Skullcandy Crusher ANC:Pros- Deeper, most powerful bass of all. Haptic bass knob is awesome, your head will be vibrating HARD.- Excellent music quality across highs, mids, lows.- Most comfortable. Love the plush top band. For smaller heads, fits great!- Call quality is excellent. Tested with my husband and he said it sounded like I was there.- Deep red color is SO COOL.- $199 price-point is way more affordable than Sony WM-1000XM4. Only $50 more than Evo for better bass and more comfort.Cons- ANC causes a hum, even when ANC is off, so listening to podcasts or acoustic music is meh.- ANC is kind of weak. Works better for noises like airplanes vs human voices.- The adjustable headband is not as tight as the Evo, it opens up a bit when you hold from the top. But it doesn't affect anything once you put on the headphones.Skullcandy Crusher Evo:Pros- Tight build, variety of colors. Light grey was really slick, a bit more grey than the images show on Amazon.- Very good sound overall for the $149 price. Bass was solid. No humming when music is off.- Longer battery life than both other models, but no ANC at all.Cons:- Headband padding is plastic and SUPER UNCOMFORTABLE. Gave me a headache after just a few minutes.- Haptic bass is nowhere as broad in range as the ANC. At 100%, it was where ANC is at 25%. To me, I wanted more vibration and bass with many songs. But, I'm a total bass-head.Sony WM-1000XM4:Pros- Best-in-class ANC. Blocks out a lot of external noises.- Good quality, well-rounded sound. 360-degree sound was fancy.- Nice build, cool touch-based controls vs the Skullcandy's physical buttons.Cons- Bass is NOT IMPRESSIVE. This is not for Bassheads. It is more about balanced sound, even at 100% bass in EQ, there was almost no vibration.- NOT for smaller heads. I'm a 5'3 woman, my husband has a smaller head for a guy too. It didn't fit either of us! That alone was a deal-breaker.- Super pricey - $350!! That's $150 more than the Skullcandy ANC, if ANC is your only priority then OK, fine, get the Sonys. But be OK with a very meh bass.To sum it all up:The Evo and ANC Skullcandy Crushers are both awesome for Bass, but for $50 more with the ANCs you get way more comfort and way more haptic bass. The buzzing on the ANCs is the only real negative I found, oh well... The Evo's headband is so hard and plastic-ee I couldn't stand it.The Sony wm-1000xm4 didn't have a stand-out bass. No haptic vibrations. And they were huge, too large for my head. ANC was epic, but that's not my end goal, I want out of this world bass, comfort, and great phone call quality.Skullcandy Crusher ANC checked the most boxes for me, the Bass is INSANE, you'll LOVE IT if you're into Electronic music, Hip Hop, even Hard Rock. Microphone is amazing for calls too. ANC is kind of weak, but its not my priority so oh well, it works so-so. These headphones are fun, comfy, stylish and did I mention DAT BASS?!?! :D
First time I put these headphones on, I felt like I could feel the music and bass in a way I‚Äôve only dreamt of. These headphones are like a whole body/brain hug. Bass and electronic music of all sorts are SO awesome coming through these headphones, for any EDM fans these are a must!
I love the bass and the little slider for adjusting the bass. The noise cancelation on and off being a simple tap on one side is also awesome. I will say that the size adjustment part feels just a little loose and the headphone can get a tad hot. But I love them.
I freaking love these headphones. The sound is amazing, battery life is crazy long, super comfy. I can't say enough good about these headphones. Just buy them. Worth the extra money for superior headphones
One of the more uncomfortable headphones that I own but still the best sounding the customization is what really sells me on these honestly have a hard time wanting to use other onesI own a pair of Bose skullcandy crushers and Cohens I will compare these individually and I will be making sure than I explain myself as well as I can without wasting your timeI wanna start off by saying the noise cancellation is on par with the Bose which I would say is the best sometimes I felt completely deaf The battery life is I think probably less than advertise but still plenty you can‚Äôt really go to days without charging it but you can come close which the other ones I‚Äôve mentioned do about the same I wouldn‚Äôt seen that they falsely advertise them on ours I just say that on average I think these kind of headphones really don‚Äôt last more than a day if you‚Äôre actually using them a lot like I do now about sound quality that one‚Äôs going to take me when I feel like the rest of my life to explain to people the best way I know how to put it is it‚Äôs beneath bows and Skullcandy in different ways But possibly still above Cohen which Cohen is still not bad the Cohens I would say feel like budget ones you can buy them for about 100 bucks I bought these on sale for 140 I bought the post on sale for 180 and I bought the Skullcandy for closer to about 200 the Bose I have are a iteration that was used for gaming and is an all-around amazing headset both in how it fits how light it is it goes all the way around the ear. doesn‚Äôt feel too big not too tight and probably the single most comfortable headphones out there. the sound is as wide and rich as you could imagine it‚Äôs pretty much perfect but it has zero customizability which is sort of frustrating the Skullcandy crushers that I have are actually The Skullcandy crusher ANC which is the highest ranking Skullcandy headphones I‚Äôd say with the base slider all the way down they match the sound of the Bose but the headphones themselves don‚Äôt.they are not completely comfortable might be one of the more uncomfortable headphones that I own right behind it I would say that these razor headphones are actually closer to the skullcandy in terms of uncomfortability just because of how oddly tight that they are... not very light either The Cohen are actually surprisingly the closest to the bose in terms of comfortability but when it comes to gaming use I‚Äôd say they all fit just fine and that the the razors come close to first right behind Skullcandy my reasonings for this is because the 3-D ability of really telling you where things are in a video game  is fascinatingly well done the skullcandy  have a better range of sound like that of the Bose while also giving the user the ability to decide how much base they want which is actually what makes them in my opinion the coolest ones. razor is right behind those with less customizability being there no base slider.

Three times better than the low price would suggest.
Harsh highs, it does seem to have the same sound profile as a microsoft lifechat lx 6000.
The build is solid for the price, it‚Äôs lightweight and very comfortable. Sound quality is at its best with feeding it power though an amp. The low end gets more color and sound stage opens up. Overall good headphone for the price but the extra long permanently attached cable is junk. Probably the worst cable ever. It‚Äôs janky and kills using these headphones. Returned.

I've been happy with this product, I bought it two years ago, and it has worked fine ever since.The only complain I have is the cushions started to wear off and flake off after about 1 year (which is understandable).
If you like extra bass on your music then these headphones are for you. Reasonably priced, light and comfortable to wear.
These are a modern version of an older Sony headphone. The old version had a thicker gauge wire and it was much longer, almost 6 feet. This pair has a short 4 foot cable and the wire gauge is thin.These do add a microphone, but it doesn't sound amazing and makes the plug less compatible with extension cables I have.The ability to fold these is nice and makes them good for travel. They are comfortable to wear. Sound isn't amazing but for the price is good. Really the cord is the only thing I can complain about on these.Honestly... the cord length killed it, but the ear pads fit the old pair I have so I swapped them out and am still using the old ones!
I am using these headphones on a desktop computer.  Couldn't be more satisfied.
Son b√°sicos, pero de buen sonido por su precio, me encanta son muy √∫tiles y c√≥modos.
for the money spent.. very good return
I am totally happy with the product and also its adjustment. fast shipping
Son unos excelentes auriculares, clasicos pero fiuncionan correctamente. La calidad del sonido es muy buena.
I don't know what noise cancelling has to do with these headphones because outside of the earpieces covering your ears, there isn't any. It barely dampens noise at all.The button only works for music is you install the app which is only available for Xperia phones unless you sideload from somewhere. And even if you do that, it doesn't work unless the phone is unlocked and the music player is the active app. So, the point of using the button where you keep your phone in your pocket and can control your music still isn't possible. If you have the app open anyway, it's easier to just use the phone screen. You may be able to answer a call with it but I haven't tested that.The sound quality is just ok. There isn't much special about it.The headphones are pretty comfortable though. My ears are pretty sensitive and I can't use headphones for extended periods usually but these don't put much pressure on them so I can wear these for several hours.
This is a high quality set of headphones for its audio quality, but the two drawbacks it has are the thin cords, and the mic.I love these headphones, and I've been using them for a long time. I had one pair that I used for TWO FULL YEARS before they broke. That was honestly just my fault, the jack exploded from dropping my device on it(genuinely me just being clumsy, the jack is a little bit more durable than that).The PICTURES I have displayed here show it has a nice folding design, but be careful with the cords. A little too much tugging will cause some problems for the mic. As for the Cushion, which you see in the second picture, is absolutely amazing. This LOOKS poor quality, but absolutely not, the more it gets worn like this, the better it feels. This second par is a little more noticeable, but my last pair literally felt like they ceased to exist, and I was absorbed in the atmosphere of the game I was playing(SOMA).Like I said, its cord is pretty delicate, and the microphone isn't that great. If you want a microphone, look elsewhere, but this is the set for audiophiles who hate pressure on their ears!

Does the job
Good sound quality and fit. My only complaint and the reason I only gave it 4 stars was after wearing them for 30-45 minutes my ear flaps began to hurt from the pressure of the ear phones.
The ear piece on one end is supposed to be held on with a little snap-in plastic part. I took these out of the package to put them together for my 91-yr-old father. That plastic piece will not snap in. There are no instructions. Either a small tube of super glue should be included or better yet, this item should be discontinued! The first set had the same issue- my sister ordered those and I thought my father broke them accidentally so I ordered the same ones. Junk!
BROKE AFTER 8 MONTHS
I bought to replace older set of headphones that was not working right
Great for the money
I bought these earphones a little while back I have never been so impressed.I live in a very cold area of Oregon and I like to sleep with my ears covered at night and they keep me warm the cord is long enough to roll around anywhere in bed and the easy to put on an easy to take off.The sound is delicious and doesn't penetrate your brains.  Everything just seems to be proper and the quality is a 1.Thank you folks for something I found finally works well for me and I highly recommend it for others.Mary to
It's broken!!
https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Wireless-Canceling-Headphones/product-reviews/B08WZXP336/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews
I tested these units in a Walmart store near me and was blown away. I could not hear a single thing around me, even with friends speaking directly to me about 4-5 feet away (1.5 meters).I purchased my headphones and expected similar noise canceling, and while really good, it was not as good as the units I had tried before. I tried updating the software but the Sony Headphones Connect app says they are up to date. Not too sure on that, but I have a feeling if you were to purchase these you will have an amazing experience. They honestly have good depth and clarity. It's not Hi-Fi quality even when wired in, but it's definitely nothing to complain about, especially with the portability of these in their decently sized case.Only complaints are my Sony MDR-XB950BT headphones are much more comfortable for prolonged periods of time, and have an insane battery life, but that being said they do not have active noise processing, noise cancelling or noise pass through like the XM4's do so that's understandableAnd the MDR's sound genuinely atrocious. With bass boost off you have the flattest music you have ever heard, and not in a flat EQ curve way, as in it has literally zero life to it, and with bass boost on it's a muddy puddle sounding experience. I have to turn bass on my EQ whether on PC or my phone down almost all the way and even then the Sony MDR tries to overcompensate for that even without active noise processing. Terrible.The XM4 was a massive massive upgrade from that old unit, and if someone were to ask me for a good headphone recommendation, I would tell them to check out the XM3 because I heard they are identical drivers, just with a little less active noise cancelling features and no proximity sensors.
I went from a pair of Beat Studio 3's, which I thought were pretty good when it came to noise-canceling and sound quality......  I have also been a big advocate for not Sony due to previous experiences with their products.These are some of the best headphones I have ever had, and I am using Sennheiser with my main rig, but when I go out, I want to use the XM4s because of the sound quality noise-canceling, and general feel. I generally use AirPods due to the ease of keeping them on me constantly, but I have found myself reaching more for these headphones because I like the sound quality.Pros: - Noise-canceling is amazing - Sound quality 12/10 (note this is after my own personal tuning, I prefer a lot heavier on the lower tones) - Head pressure/feel on my head - Build quality feels premium - Case is super lovely for what it is - Being able to swap between devices is super nice - BATTERY LIFE IS SO NICE!!!Cons: The material (Leather/ish) is somewhat scratchy for my skin; I think this is primarily due to my hair. -  Having to balance it myself. I know I will have to balance everything because of my taste in music and sound, but it can be unpleasant. - Touch controls SUCK I truly hate touch controls and have always hated them; tactile is 100% better - I am not a fan of the app due to it's just not super amazing on an Apple device, but it works so like (insert shrug)To the Seller; I received a different pair of headphones, WI-C310 as opposed to the ones advertised which was a bit annoying but doesn't bother me personally.
While it's a nice deal, I feel like I have to make my ears bleed just to keep the earbuds in. They are useless to me. On the other hand, the headphones sound good. They have good battery life and noise cancellation. However, the touch controls should be considered a crime against humanity. The touch controls get activated if you so much as breathe the wrong way, and have been an unmitigated source of annoyance in my day to day life. I have accidentally triggered the touch controls so many more times than I have purposely used them that it's not even close.
Beautiful piece of technology -- hardware wise. Compared to the Bose ones, t just feels a bit "toy"ish because of the plastic casing. The Bose has a more premium feel and look to it. Noise cancelling and sound wise, its great.Firmware wise: ü§Æ. How hard can it be to write decent software for a pair of headphones. The speech to talk randomly kicks in after every firmware update? It used to turn off on its own after a while of not using it, but now that doesn't work anymore? The worse: switching between devices is SUPPOSED to be seamless but its an awful experience because it doesn't work most of the time.
I bought these headphones because I needed to block out the sound of our new neighbors.  My workspace is adjacent to their front door and sitting area.  The previous neighbors hardly made any sound, but our new neighbors open their windows open and enjoy sitting and talking outside using their outside voice.  More power to them. The headphones work surprisingly well at noise cancellation.  When used on their own without sound playing it cuts down the undesired noise quite a bit.  When the user plays music it works very well.  There is a volume at which the undesired noise cuts off completely behind the music that is being played.  I also played a white noise track in the background to the same effect.Good bass response.  Nice stereo sound.  Bluetooth works well in line of sight.  The headphone cable could be longer. The charging cable length is a joke.  Way too short.I have only had these a short while, but I would buy them again now that I have tried them.
The bundle I purchased was supposed to include Sony WI-SP500 in-Ear Sports Wireless Headphones (Black) but instead arrived with Sony WI-C310 earbuds.This is not so much about the price point difference between the units because the fact that the bundle came with an extra item is a bonus in itself but that I was not given a choice in the decision.Otherwise, I am initially impressed with the WH-1000XM4 headphones
Bass is a little bit weak while watching Netflix, but sound quality  and ANC are real good in Listening Apple Music .  It‚Äôs good time to take WH-1000XM4 home in price under 250 USD, especially one more BT sport in-ear headphones wI-SP500 is in this boundless .
Never had noise cancelling before and it's alright, can still hear the hum of my PC with nothing playing. Near no delay if at all with a BT 4.0 adapter. Also, very comfortable from my previous WH-CH500 pair, they would crush my ear flat, press the arms of my glasses against my skull, and had to ware a hat to mitigate that. The battery does indeed last 30hrs, charged it two days ago and it's around 50%. Price could be better if I actually got the wireless earbuds that were advertised in the order.
This was a gift for our grandson that is working with a large consulting firm and he using them while on his computer and flying a lot.
One of the best headsets I‚Äôve ever used. Sound quality is great!

I bought these in April of 2020 when I found myself suddenly working at home, like most of us U.S. Office Workers.  With 2 young kids and  a husband also working at home, it was noisy and distracting for me.  It was very difficult to work at home and keep the noise and distractions at bay.  These headphones worked perfectly.  I head nothing.  I even went for a walking one on one and a delivery truck rumbled by and the other person I was talking to didn't hear a thing.I wear them now for every call I do including recording webinars, Zoom, Teams and WebEx calls.  I use them to listen to Pandora on my mobile and sometimes I use them when not even in a call - I just block out the house noise.They were easy to install, my personal and work devices all connected easily without any problems.  The white has held up and even after hours of use, the leather ear pieces are still in great shape.  The inner part where it lies against your ear is showing some discoloration and I'm not sure how to clean that.  But other than that - the color is great. I also get a ton of compliments on them - people love the look and say they hear me very well.  I highly recommend them - even at this price as you will get your money's worth.
I am obsessed with these headphones!  I use them daily.  Awesome sound quality, very noise cancelling, easy to control, easy to set up, easy connect-ability.  While I use them frequently, I take VERY good care of them.  They are always in the case.  I baby these things.Recently, the soft part of the headphones just started falling apart.  No hard wear and tear.  Today, I took them out of the case and the inside of the headphone was detached.  I am so so bummed! I bought them in June 2020-- not that long ago.  I've had other headphones for way longer and this has never happened.Does anyone know if there are replacement headphone pads?  What's the deal with the warranty?  I don't want to buy new headphones already and these ones word fine, except they are falling apart.Help! :(
Impressive comfort, soft feel over ear flexible design, soft sound quality and super noise canceling functionality.makes my daughter‚Äôs train commute super quiet, sweet soft sound was a wao factor she txted me.
I love my music to be clean and balanced, without a lot of outside noise interference.  So I purchased these Bose NC700's, which is the 4th set of Bose handsets that I own (all working fine).  But excited about the brand since an old girlfriend gave the first QC15's.  The QC 25's, 35ii, and this NC700, have been excellent headphones for travel, and just for cutting the grass, if need me.I had tried the Sony series, but I had problems with the touch controls.  The NC700's also have touch controls, but came out after the Sony's, so it seems Bose managed to correct the problem, that I experienced with the Sony headphone.Sound quality is clean, crisp and clear.  The way I like it. NOTE-  No Bose headphone I have ever owned (4 devices) has been a bass champ, but that is fine with me.  The blue-tooth devices I can connect it to are capable of kicking up the bass, when I want that.  The sound quality and noise cancellation was no better or worse than the QC 35ii's.Using It- It takes a little getting use to that when you slide the earcups up and down that they don't have any detents to click on as they move.  Also, they do not fold down as compactly as my other Bose headphones, so I am extra careful with them.  I've done a back to back comparison and quite honestly, I like the way the pads of the Bose QC 35ii, fit around my ear better.  The QC 35ii pads appear to be flatter (or maybe I've just worn them down), so they mold to my head better.  I also like the headband feel better.Phone calls- The main advantage of these compared to the QC 35ii, is the quality of the phone call, that can be made when they are turned on.  To test it out, I watched private jets depart at my local airport from the observation stand.  When I received a phone call, the caller had no idea that I was in a noisy environment.  It wasn't until a plane came real close, that they finally said, "what's that sound in the background".Setup is a pain-  These require that you download their Bose Music app, before they will connect to your device.  Ridiculous.  It took several attempts before I got it to work.  Most headphones, you tell your blue tooth device to search for the headphone and you are done.Summary-  When purchased at a good price, these are very good noise cancellation headphones.  Even CR gives them a better rating than their XM4 equivalents.  However, I am cheap.  I will never pay $350 to $400 for anyone's headphones.  But I got these on the Prime Day Sale for about $230 and have added them to my Bose collection.  They will be used mainly for travel, with the QC35ii's relegated to everyday house and yard use.Bose headphones are good.  This is my 5th set and I've no complaints.  WAIT!  Yes, I do!  Battery life is not high on any of the wireless Bose.  About 20hrs, but at least these tell you how many hours you have left.  I have other headphone Wyze and Anker, they will run for 30 to 40 hrs, but they are NOT Bose.
Bose headphones are noise suppression first, sound fidelity second. If it‚Äôs sound fidelity you want, buy a comparably priced studio monitor headphone without noise suppression.I‚Äôve owned and worn out every iteration of the Bose noise-canceling headphones over the last 20 years for jet cabin noise suppression. Commercial airplane cabin noise is a proven travel fatigue-inducing component. A 2-17 hour flight with noise reduction headphones delivers noticeably less flight fatigue.The QC-35‚Äôs are nearly worn out after another ‚Äòmillion miles.‚Äô They got 5 stars for the Bose attention to long-wear comfort. They‚Äôve been beaten about, dinged, I‚Äôve replaced the ear and head cushions twice. I suspect I have a wiring failure that‚Äôs about to reveal itself fully. I use the Bose most frequently without music for just the noise suppression. They work great as a sleep aid in hotels with and without music. Noise suppression is my #1 priority in this category. I have tested 2 of the latest Bose noise suppression headphone competitors. For several reasons, mostly head comfort and suppression extent, they still have a way to go to meet the Bose total experience.The ambient noise suppression that these new 700 headphones provide is a significant improvement over the QC-35‚Äôs. The bass quality of Bose has always been a question mark easily revealed in a sales counter testing for comparison. Honestly, after an hour, the bass issue disappears in the Bose sound ambiance.As to music reproduction, Bose does not represent the product as a monitor grade headphone. I happen to have a pair of Blue Ella monitor grade headphones. It is an error to compare the Bose work-horse noise suppression headphones that the 700 series represent with studio monitor grade fidelity. There is no question that studio monitor grade headphones deliver superior fidelity for the time they are worn.Can I comfortably wear the Blue Ella‚Äôs on a trans-con flight? No (plus they are prone to a five-finger discount). They simply aren‚Äôt designed for hours of head comfort. The Blue Ella‚Äôs are fantastic for a couple of hours but are no way suitably head comfortable for a 17-hour flight to Australia.The Bose 700‚Äôs are a clear step up for the QC-35 users. These are lighter on the head, and though they don‚Äôt have hingey elements of the QC-35, I‚Äôve not experienced a flexibility problem from this lighter weight and flexible design. They are an improvement in the Bose reputation for the best designed, long-wear consideration.
Can't give 3.5, so I rounded up to 4, but I want to give these 3.5.I bought these to be my all-day, everyday headphones for work. I'm on several hours of meetings a day through virtual meeting platforms and otherwise just listen to music. I don't need noise canceling for me, but wanted these for noise canceling for people listening to me when I'm speaking. They are certainly great for my specific need in many ways, though I wish they were better in a few ways.The great: I love these for call clarity. Sound is great for me. People can hear me clearly with very little, if any, background noise. They are rather comfortable to wear all day. I don't feel like they are pinching, despite my large melon. When I have activated noise canceling, it's been eerily good.The ok: Battery life is 17 hours at most when fully charged. It tells me this when I turn them on from a full charge, and it aligns to what I experience. This means I don't get 2 full work days of use. They usually die in the afternoon of a second day of use.  I wish it was 20 hours or more, so I could get through 2 full days. Pairing with my Windows 10 laptop was easy enough, but I wish there was a dedicated Windows app. More about pairing in the bad.The bad: Range is poor. My audio disconnects or degrades at 6-8 feet away with a wall between and maybe up to 20 feet without a wall. This is about half of what I'd expect the minimum to be. (Maybe it's because I have a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard?) Pairing with a phone + a PC is bad. Incoming phone calls will automatically hijack your connection, so you can't hear your PC, which is really bad when you are in a lot of meetings. Bose, please fix this. I've had to make the choice to unpair my phone entirely from my headset, which also means I lose some functionality that you can only get by connecting with a phone through the mobile app. I really don't understand how someone designed this intentionally or failed to design a better user experience. Does no one at Bose responsible for this product use a PC for meetings and has a mobile phone?
I purchased these Bose headphones for use on Teams meetings for work.  I decided on these even though I saw negative feedback that they didn't work well for Teams/Zoom calls  - my reasoning was that I am a former software developer, and having worked in IT for 15 years I would be able to find some way to make them function, right?Well, not so much.  The good news is, once you get these to work, They. Are. FANTASTIC.  I mean that.  They have an EQ app that allows you to set the level at which you hear your own voice, and you can adjust the level of noise cancellation on a scale from 1-10 - important for me, because the super-noise cancellation makes me dizzy and I need to dial it back.Now the bad - there is a Bose dongle which is sold separately.  It's not cheap, but it instantly resolves any and all issues with Teams/Zoom.  (I do Teams meetings daily and Zoom about 1x per week). I did not try any of the off-brand dongles, as I didn't really have time to mess with it.  My main gripe about this is: this is a known issue for Bose, and it seems to me that after they released the dongle to resolve the issue, perhaps for $400 you could include the dongle with the freaking headphones.  Still a little peeved about this, but they honestly work so well and sound so good I'm [almost] over it.  almost.  Slight annoying: long battery life but they cannot be used while charging; just remember to plug them in when the battery is getting low and they're great.The Ugly: Amazon will not sell you the dongle unless you purchase through a "business account".  I understand that Amazon has built it's business around marketing, etc. but this is just gross.  C'mon Amazon - you already get constant business from me, I've been a prime member from the first year it was an option, I buy all my music from you, books, kindles, on and on.  You DO NOT need my work email.  I am a busy professional receiving hundreds of emails a day and I get enough spam and phishing emails to choke a horse.  I am so sick of promotional emails and on my work email they are borderline infuriating.  This was a cheap shot and I refused to go there.  So not that it makes a dent, but I purchased from a competitor who was happy to send the receipt to my personal email no problems.  Honestly, this irritated me more than Bose selling the dongle separately.But I digress, these are very high quality headphones that work seamlessly [with dongle]; one charge gets me through at least 3 days of heavy use and the EQ app is a great way to customize your sound preferences.  Overall very happy with this purchase.
Hello. If you are reading this, you are probably doing it because of the title. I have autism. If you also have autism, these headphones are definitely worth trying out. First of all, the problem with most (all others that I have tried) over-ear headphones‚Äîfor a person on the spectrum, or someone with sensory issues‚Äîis that they tend to fit like a vice grip on my head. It‚Äôs an incredibly uncomfortable feeling and I inevitably end up hating all other over-ear headphones that I have tried before this pair. Why are these different? If you will notice, the over-ear piece of the equipment is not 100% attached to the over-the-head band; they are flexible. This is a key feature of the design that applies specifically to autism. These headphones are honestly THE MOST COMFORTABLE (i use all caps because I cried the first time I put them on, it was that amazing) headphones I have ever had the pleasure of wearing; they fit like a f***ing glove! I use caps and profanity because I‚Äôm emotional about how amazing these headphones are.Okay, that brings me to design feature number two: the noise canceling. Oh. My. Sweet. Jesus. I sobbed the first time I turned on the noise canceling. I was sitting in bed with my weighted blanket (guys, I‚Äôm going through some repressed memories so the stress is at an all-time high right now) and I put these one to drown out the sound of my (also autistic) son and whatever other noises were happening in our small apartment. It was like a freakin dove descended from heaven to relieve my senses of the constant oppression they experience on a daily basis, that I have learned to ignore after 33 years of dealing with it (I am 33 years old). But, as the book says, ‚Äúthe body keeps the score,‚Äù right? Oh my word. My body instantly relaxed like it was at a f***ing spa! In the middle of my tiny apartment. With my child screaming in the other room. Silence. Total silence. Inner peace. Transcendence. All of the above. It was amazing. If you are looking for noise canceling performance, these have it in spades (I make no comparison to other brands because I have not tried many over $300 headphones).Okay, lets move on. The third feature that is amazing: battery life. These puppies last and last and last. I wore them for two days straight with out needing to charge until the end of day two. I have never experienced that level of battery performance from any other headphones so color me impressed.In conclusion, these headphones are the most amazing thing I own. Not even kidding. No exaggeration. I‚Äôm in love. I carry so much less stress knowing that by simply putting these on I can escape the constant onslaught of sensory information I receive on a daily basis. Even if I‚Äôm not wearing them, just knowing that I have this option sometimes makes all the difference. If you have autism, or are sensitive to auditory stimulation, definitely give these babies a try. In my opinion, they are worth every penny.  Thank you for reading. I hope you enjoyed my perspective.
It feels like they tried to jam too many bells and whistles in this one. My headphones also broke entirely within a month of getting them. But still I'm currently pleased with the experience, and here is why:The noise cancellation is the best I've experienced. For over-ear headphones, and Bose especially, there's a certain air pressurization when you turn noise canceling on. Then, if you lay down or push against the cup, there's an audible squeak. These headphones don't have that. No other weird noises... just clear noise canceling, and powerful. I hate listening to the world, and this does the trick.They're a little tricky getting used to, but I love the touch and tap controls, too.As for the negatives, and there are several:1. The microphone is fairly non-operative with my Samsung Note9. At first I thought I received a defective unit, then my friend walked me through tweaking my software.. essentially the drivers my phone used with the headphones. We fixed it for a night, but the phone kept switching itself back to different drivers. We did not determine which app was doing it, but part of me wondered if it was the actual Bose app.2. Yeah, the Bose app. It's.... fine. I really like that I can control the level of noise cancellation and monitor the battery level. But the pairing of the headphones to the app is inconsistent. And whatever the "immersive 3d" whatever features it offered did not work.3. They broke. Essentially stopped charging or turning on. I have no idea what happened, but if I had to guess, it may well have been my fault? I do have inconsistent power output next to my bed. But that outlet generally charges things slowly, which to me, it feels like not enough power should not have ended these headphones. But it did: they basically showed a solid blue and red light when plugged in but did not charge. I tried all the troubleshooting methods (fully draining the battery, factory reset, different chargers, cleaning the charging points) to no avail.4. Um, the $33 insurance for these things turned out to be a bit of a joke, given they declined to help until the warranty expired. So it did say the insurance was 3 years, but in reality, it is only 2, given Bose is guaranteeing the product the first year from purchase.I just got off with customer service today, which is why my review is still a positive one. They didn't ask too many questions before replacing my headphones with a new pair--not refurbished--and a warranty for those that restarted for another year. They even changed the color-- I didn't end up liking the soapstone.Would I recommend these to others? Honestly: no. I would look at some other Bose headphone models that have been tested out and a bit better reviewed. I **really** wanted for the price a mic that worked, but I'm keeping these because they still do what I need them most for: noise canceling, which as I said, is the best I've ever experienced.
This is a tough review to write. On the one hand, these are the most comfortable headphones of any the that I have had/used in years. They fit beautifully, the cups are well padded and it is no issue wearing them for hours. The noise cancellation is very good though from the reviews I read prior to purchase I expected better. On the top level (there are ten levels of noise cancellation) while most of the outside world is shut out, for some reason I can still hear background noise or conversations even while I am listening to my audiobooks. Yes, it is significantly muted and when compared to the other NC levels it is obvious that it is doing a lot of blocking. I guess, at this price point, and with all the hype I expected total silence. Maybe that's unrealistic so I set myself up.Additionally I find that the power lasts well and I like the headset telling me when I turn them on how many hours instead of a percentage of battery life. I like the option for three NC settings which I can find fairly easily on the left ear cup to switch when necessary though I really pretty much keep them on 10. When I wear them it's because I want to shut out the world and hear my book without background noise so I don't often need to change the settings. Pairing them was easy and I like that they can be hooked up to two devices at the same time so it is easy to switch from listening to my book on my iPhone  to listening to something on my MacBook.I have used them several times during zoom meetings and a couple times on phone calls and I could hear the conversations perfectly and the others said they could hear me fine.The big knock for me (aside from price but I guess that's not that big a surprise) is that there seems to be a constant hiss in the background when I am listening to audiobooks. At first I thought it was a quality issue with the book I was listening to at the time but it now happens in every book I'm listening to. I have noticed it from time to time when kittening to music as well but not as consistently as with audiobooks.So overall, they are solid, comfortable, strongly noise cancelling headphones that are easy to use and pair with the minor aggravation of some background hissing.

They are very cool headphones! Love the color and the Noise cancellation works amazing! Def the coolest I‚Äôve ever had.
About 7 hours of use in, and my opinions are the following :> They connect & reconnect (after being upaired to one device) FAST> If you like to wear items that get public attention in general or stand out, the neon green does that. How often to you see people wearing neon green headphones ?> The earpiece foam is the very generic foam that you would have found in headphones prior to the widespread use of memory foam/memory foam hybrids. If you can picture what I'll call "80's foam", thats what is in these headphones. Which means limited comfort and a much more limited foam lifespan.Because of the type of foam used, you'll also develop wear fatigue from the headphones sooner. I find myself moving them around every few hours because there 1) isn't enough foam and 2) the type of foam isn't really supportive of very long (ex: 5 hours) use sessions> The earpiece cups are just touching on being undersized without being undersized. So if you have larger ears and find on-ear headphones (these arent on ear, but for people with larger ears they will be in part) painful, these probably will not work for you.> Sound quality is fine, thus far its roughly comparable to my Skullcandy Crushers. Make sure you install the mobile app and tune the headphones to your sound preferences/needs.> The noise cancellation on these headphones is very reasonable. Not stellar, not terrible -- but reasonable.> Battery life : I'm about 7 hours in on the charge that they came with out of the box, and thus far the battery life like the noise cancellation is reasonable.Present conclusion : These are an "okay" set of headphones, but, if I were on a budget of around $100 usd for one set of over-ear bluetooth headphones, these would not be my choice.Flatly, you can get better over-all for the money.The one feature that I do really enjoy, is the aggressiveness with which these headphones want to pair with a device.
Just bought this item yesterday and can't believe I have to write this review so soon.NB: using exclusively on my PC and have not had a chance to use the mic (but the mic being good or not would not affect my overall opinion)Starting with the pros:-Really good noise cancellation-Looks really good-Fits comfortably in my ears-Battery life is pretty nice, can't say too much (charged for 2-3hrs, been using for almost 12hrs now, hasnt died or showed low battery yet)Now for the cons:- Not sure why, but does not connect automatically. Windows keeps saying that it failed to connect. So every time I turn it off and on, I have to remove it from my list of paired devices and re-add it for it to connect.- Auto turns off after 5mns of no noise. (Can bypass by downloading the app on your phone or tablet and changing the setting to never, but nowhere says that so had to google.)-Really choppy sounds randomly. Audio would play and out of nowhere it's like it stuttered for half a second and happens often enough that it gets annoying.-Does not pick up dialogue very well when there is background music. Watched a few movies and shows and the background music is almost always louder than the voice.-Sound quality feels degraded. You get used to it after a while, but audio does sound worse with these on.-Lastly, this is personal, but there is no real way of checking your battery level apart from when you first turn it on and/or using the app. (using this for my pc so I can't use the app)Overall,  I hope that maybe it's just my headset that is defective but for the price, I don't think I would recommend buying this.
it starts with pokemon go, and the need to listen for that team rocket balloon. two handed dog walks where i can seamlessly go between ios, windows, and mac os should be heaven but‚Ä¶ damn if i didnt reach to chamge the anc and find that thenplastic cracked like low grade lego knickoff and with it came ine ear cup, wire removed clean,y into the headband. now this could be a bad pair affter a mknth - or it could be that ive had this happen 4x and only ince was the damage me and a car wheel in the wrong place. i thinka refund is deserved considering my loyalty but hey, amazon doesnt do nice thjngs
First pair of wireless headphones and LOVIN' it. Until now, I've been using an Amazon headset which, actually, is pretty good for my needs (tuning out the world while exercising). BUT I was wire bound..which sucks when you are on a rowing machine or a climber!Razer pros:>>fits COMFORTABLY over my ears>>my favorite color>>can hear EVERYTHING while watching a movie on my 10" Fire TableCons:volume controls could be better placed.I'm not picky about sound so as far as I'm concerned...this sounds great!!
Was somewhat worried about the latency of Bluetooth headphones, but these came in just as good as wired ones. The microphone doesn't play well with linux, but since I already had a standalone mic that didn't really matter
Se acomodan bien, no presionan las orejas, desde que llegaron no los e cargado, excelente sonido excelente calidad, faltar√≠a un escuche ya que no se pueden guardar tan facil y se podr√≠an da√±ar. De resto 100% Recomendados ...
Setup and tested 3 ways - with Bluetooth transmitter for TV watching, connected thru a MacBook and directly with iPhone.Solid construction. Quickly connects to Bluetooth within 3 seconds. Audio is clear and not overpowering, could be louder. Controls are simple and easy to adjust.Used over 8 hours and still at 50%. Great feature - while connected watching TV, for power level, simply connected to Audio app and confirmed remaining power level and made changes to the EQ on the fly.Another great feature - auto power off. Saves battery life when nothing detected and quickly reconnects.Cons - Audio level could be higher, Ear muffs covers bad quality and already losing color. Awful placement of the microphones. Aimed to top and not near mouth area.
I think the music when being played sounds like someone messed with a couple of wires and made it sound worse than its supposed to. I wouldn't spend money on this if I was you.
To start off I only had a few hours with the headset.Unfortunately after extended use the left side of my headset stopped working and rather than running through hoops for headphones I decided where lack luster, I just returned them.For my fellow lovers of bass, thump, and punch in your music, these are not at all what you want. Abysmal across the board when it comes to those.If you're a fan of neutral sound then these would fit that category.But for some reason, all the music sounds muffled like someone is actively blocking the speakers.Now this could have been my pair considering they broke on me, but I feel like im not the only one who feels like these headphones are definitely lacking.Had these been within the $50-$60 range I could definitely recommend.Its sound I would expect from cheap headphones, not a $100 pair.The ANC did absolutely nothing,  literally I noticed no difference on or off, I still heard everything clearly.Razer didn't necessarily drop the ball, but they certainly priced it wrong.

I really like them. They are light and the sound are great. The only complaint that I have is if I listen my music really loud then people around me can listen to my music.
Comfy, nice build, but needs higher volume output for when you want to crank up the music
These headphones feels like an aviation or NASA headsets for people works on operating flights etc., these looks very huge on head and looks feels weird to use these in office location. I used it for few days in my office and most of them looked at me with weird expressions‚Ä¶ not sure on what reference Logitech designed these headphones for office but does not work for all hopefully.
Lightweight, comfortable‚Ä¶ can be worn for long periods of time. Excellent blue tooth pairing and ideal for those needing to use for phone and video meetings. Music and other sound do sound great. Very good headphones for the price.
Thanks
I purchased this product because they advertised excellent dual microphone noise canceling. I expected there to be a drop in quality from my wired Logitech Zone 750 but this is terrible. I've been told it sounds like I'm in a tin can and they can hear my typing, air purifier, dog barking, cars passing. I've played with all the settings. Testing on a Dell XPS 950 Windows 10, MacBook 2018, Lenovo T540, Dell Latitude and the results are the same. The speakers are crap too. Save your money and do not but this product.
I ordered these to have a ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù secondary headset for music/movies/video calls while I work. My other headset I primarily use for gaming. I can say these are a great replacement for my gaming headset.The bass is good, punchy and no rattle. The highs are also great. Build quality is also great. It‚Äôs mainly plastic, but the plastic feels high quality and durable. I think what impressed me was the lack of weight. They are super light, without feeling cheap. I can wear them for hours on end with no complaints.I think my only cons are I wished they got a bit louder and the mic isn‚Äôt terrible, but I prefer my AirPod Pros. The mic itself is a little too tinny for my liking.
SO I had a chance to review these new logitech zone vibe 100 headset, and I gotta say, I didn't look at the price until I started writing this review. My answer to $99 is no way. I was thinking in my head $40 to $45. While I found the bass to be fine, and the lows fine, the BT leaves this headset with a lot to be desired. First off this is by no means a gamer headset. BT is a horrible medium for gaming sound, and to Logitech's benefit, no where on the box itself does it say gaming anywhere(Just inside). They are being billed as a phone, calls headset. Well I guess that is fine, but in a packed world of fantastic ear buds would you want these over those? I do not see the niche. And the $99 for a headset billed at lasting just 18 hours talk/ 20 hours listen. While I would say on a positive they are very light, The ear muffs just aren't that comfortable over ,more than 30 minutes. They don't breathe well so your ears get hot. They used 40mm drivers which surprisingly didn't do as bad as almost any other 40mm I have tried, it is still noticeable. I would take my $99 and get a nice pair of ear buds.
As expected from Logitech, this headset is well made and looks snazzy. The scope of delivery included a bag and charging cable (USB-C) as well as a quick start guide. Its light weight and fits perfect, at least on my head. Very comfortable even when worn for hours. Connecting via Bluetooth to a PC was very quick and easy. No additional drivers required. All the features you need for conference calling or listening to music are there and can be controlled via small buttons on the headset. A soft female voice gives feedback on the functions. The microphone on the side is foldable and is automatically muted when flipped up or vice versa when flipped down. The sound quality for conference calls is very good, as is the MICROPHONE noise cancellation. The sound quality for listening to music is well balanced, only the bass is a bit too rich, but most younger people like that. It's not a high-end headset for music enthusiasts, but it's a great all-rounder in my opinion. All in all it is a great device and I can only recommend it.
It was working perfectly fine on Zoom and quite comfortable, but when I switched to MS Teams, people could barely hear me.  I hadn't changed a thing in settings.  Going back I think.

We have several of these themed headphones and they are fine for your kids doing school work, zoom, etc. on the computer. They have pretty good sound and my kids listen to music with them as well.The quality control issue is that one of the ear pad assembly fell off shortly after opening the package. This was a spare set that was past the return envelope so I could not return. Itook a look and the ear pad is permanently affixed to a plastic plate that snaps onto another plastic part which screws onto the speaker housing with one tiny screw. The screw had been stripped in assembly. I found a slightly longer and thicker screw scavenged from another defunct toy and was able to reassemble the headset and it has been fine since.
I purchased it to keep my kid entertained, specially on long flights. It serves its purpose, with a good confort and adjustment of volume. Now when it comes to the quality, I won't say is bad but from the pictures I figured the materials would be a little better. In some parts the plastic feels a little cheap.
Got these headphones for my sons class. He normally breaks everything but these have lasted a few months now and i am pleased with them..... he likes he way they look and has not complained about the sound.
My son loves these. Comfortable, good sound, and nice design.  I just wish you could fold them like some other headphones for kids.
So cute!
My 3yo son obsessed with dinosaurs and this is perfect headphone for him! It fits perfectly for his head!
My kiddo loves using these for his tablet and gaming.
Love these headphones for my kids. They have each had several pair. They are pretty durable and kids love the padded ear pieces. Great value for the money. I haven‚Äôt worn them, so cannot speak to sound control.
This is my son's second pair and he loves them. He says the sound is clear and they've lasted quite a long time
Unfortunately they didn't hold up! Bought them August 6th. Already not working anymore.
https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-HD-350BT-Bluetooth-Headphone/product-reviews/B083WS3WPK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews
Let me start by saying I am an amateur audio enthusiast that loves a balanced and detailed sound signature.  I don't care about making phone calls or active noise cancellation (ANC).  For the most part, I wear headphones in quiet places to listen to music and ANC usually messes up the sound signature anyway.  Just give me good audio with passive noise isolation and I am satisfied.  Second, I don't care for the bloated bass you find in most consumer headphones.  Just let me hear what was recorded with clarity, detail, natural tonality, and a great sound stage.  I've spent a modest amount on DACs, amps, earphones, and headphones to deliver the kind of sound that makes you remember why you love music so much.But there are times when I just want to kick back and relax and not be tied down by wires.  My solution to date has been EarStudio's ES100 and a good pair of IEMs.  The AAC codec from an iPhone using high-quality music source (FLAC, Amazon Ultra HD) with high-end in-ear monitors sound reasonably close to my wired Drop HD6XX or Hifiman HE400i cans on my Schiit stack.  I had tried a few over-ear Bluetooth headphones but nothing has ever sounded even close to what I consider high quality audio.  Either too much bass or an ANC system that interfered with the audio signature (on or off).  Nothing met my amateur audiophile aspirations.That is until I got Sennheiser HD 350BT.  After reading a few of the reviews, I almost didn't order them.  But for under $100 I decided to take a chance.  From the first listen I was blown away by the balanced sound signature.  Not that far off from the Sennheiser house sound signature.  After 20+ hours of breaking them in, the bass has opened up just a little and the mids are still wonderfully natural and perfectly placed evenly in the mix.  And while these are not as good as a wired over-ear headphone on a high-quality dac/amp, for a wireless audio headphone solution these come close enough to free me from the wires and not feel like I am missing much.The bass is solid from sub-bass to mid-bass without muddying up the lower mids.  These are not consumer bass-head cans with bloated bass.  You can feel the thump of bass drums and toms on ears.  The bass is present way down into the frequency range, but there isn't an overpowering slam nor is it the star of the show.  But it is clean and surprisingly detailed.  And the sound app EQ settings, which is too simplistic, still let's you bump the bass some if you need a little more.  Listening to Marcus Miller on Laid Black is great for illustrating how well these handle the lower frequencies.  Miller's bass solos are a pure pleasure listen to.Mids are where many headphones fall short - either missing the natural sound of voices and instruments or placing them behind/under the bass and highs.  Yet this is where much of the audio is in most genres of music.  Voices, guitars, strings, woodwinds, brass, and snares/toms bring the bulk of audio that is to be heard.  The HD 350BT shines here.  Sennheiser really shows they know how to shape a balanced sound signature around high-quality mids.  Listening to Boney James on Future Soul I heard a natural and realistic alto sax sound that is so, so good.The highs are also very good and actually somewhat relaxed for Sennheiser.  I prefer just a little more air and sparkle, but even without EQ these are delightful.  However, using the very-basic EQ settings in the Sennheiser Sound Control app I was able to bump the highs to add exactly what I was looking for.  Cymbals and triangles ring clear and the detail and imaging provided is very good for Bluetooth wireless audio.  No distortion, sibilance, or feel of grainy treble.  You can hear small details of instrument decay, reverb, and echoes in the room.  Listening to the Marcin Wasilewski Trio with Joakim Miller on Spark of Life, I was able to hear the detailed clicks of drumsticks and subtle crash of cymbals of Michal Miskiewicz's excellent musicality on the drums in each song.But what I love best about the HD 350BT is the excellent dynamics and sound stage.  I'm not sure how Sennheiser worked their magic building a digital audio decoder and amp into a headphone that delivers such an excellent sound stage.  But I am very happy they did.  They sound equally good at low volume or high.  Overall dynamics from soft to loud is incredible for a wireless audio product.  The stage is wider than average with a good bit of depth and height.  They detail of the highs provided just enough air give that sense of spaciousness and realism I really enjoy.  It really put these over the top for me.Note that these are not the loudest headphones and to get these cranking they need to be in excess of 75% volume, which does not leave much room at the top end.  But given the excellent passive noise isolation, they are more than loud enough for most, even in a moderately loud environment.  The Sound Control App is marginally useful.  The EQ works, but is essentially a three-band equalizer that can be toggled between a hard to use visual representation or a linear hi/mid/low band setting that is easier to use.  I do wish that Sennheiser could have provided a 5 or 7 band EQ.  But as I said it works - just could be better.I also found the HD 350BT headphones to be very comfortable and can wear them for hours at a time with no discomfort.  That said, the ear pads are soft but somewhat small and could be problematic for someone with larger ears.  The build quality is solid despite the plastic material used for the majority of the body.  They also look great in black to me.  But don't expect frills, a case, or even a bag.  The focus at this price is on a great audio, not accessories.If you are more of an audio purist, love the natural sound signature/tonality of Sennheiser products and don't care about ANC, then these are a huge steal at under $100.  Forget the HD 450BT and it's ANC, get these instead.  And no need to spend $300 or more on Sony and Bose.  Spend your money on great audio.  These simply sound great!
The first time I left them on accidentally I was like oh no they're going to die! and then they didn't still for a long time. The second time I woke up and there was still music playing out of them which I'm sure was entirely my fault and even then they didn't die for a while. Now I leave them on without sound going and it's great. I also love how I can pair it to my phone and my laptop and it knows which one to pair to based on the sound output. So neat! Who knew headphones could be so great? What would I change... Maybe have the English woman who tells me it's pairing or whether I'm turning it off or on just talk to me randomly with some sort of AI like she's my friend and really likes this song or she's tired of listening to music can't we go for a silent walk or something like that why do you only want to hear what I have to say when you want to listen to music or watch television why can't we just be silent together and I'd say yes Senny, sorry Senny.
When I get a new album and I want to really hear every detail, these aren't the ones I use... I've got no way to connect these to my record player. I have my favorite  headphones for critical listening and I don't do that via Bluetooth.  These are the headphones I listen to while i'm making my morning coffee and my wife is still sleeping, or in a public place where I don't want to impose my music choices on people around me and I don't want to snag my cable on things when I move around. There is a time and a place for Bluetooth headphones, and that's actually a lot of times and places.These beat the crap out of all my wireless IEMs in terms of sound quality, which makes them the headphones I use most often because I don't usually want to be tethered to my amp. They work great for phone calls, and the sound is pretty good in all frequencies. I wouldn't say any part of the sound spectrum is  particularly outstanding or lacking... just adequate all around. I am happy to have these headphones.
So now having used these while at my work place for a while now (noisey environment), I have a few points on them (have had for less than 2 months):ProsGood battery lifeGood sound but a touch quiet in certain environmentsUsb C chargerConsI underestimated the control complexity(Each function is a separate button essentially)Tight squeeze fit for medium to larger heads until broke in but still tighter fit.Probably other stuff I'm forgetting currently.I wouldn't buy them again due to the controls only.
Decent headset for the price
No headphone jack. If you care about an important feature like a headphone jack, I wouldn't recommend this product. The app kinda sucks too, don't update the headphone firmware and you will be fine. Other than that it gets a 3.5/5 for me cause the battery life is great. I can go a few days to a week without charging and I use it to listen to music everyday to and from school on the bus and studying. the Sound Quality is alright, not top tier but not bad either for bluetooth headphones, above average I would say, hence the 4/5 on the sound quality. As for noise cancelling, I don't know much about it as I don't really notice it, but I can hear more of my music vs the cars passing by walking down the sidewalk. so I gave that department a 3/5
I have very sensitive ears and usually have to take of headphones - even in case when they are over ears but press some part of my ear to head. These headphones are real over-ear and I can train in them for 2 hours non-stop. Noise cancellation is about 80-90% but It's what I need to at least keep track of what happening around me. The noise that gets through is low and doesn't bother or interrupt my training. Love it!
Comfort and build: comfort is lousy because the cups are too small.  I can't wear them for too long because my ears will get sore.  If they were just slightly larger this would not be an issue.  My ears are not that large, so unless you have small ears this might be an issue.  The button layout is terrible, too many similar buttons and the power button is hard to reach.  Build wise, it is all plastic but feels well designed and durable.Noise cancelling: THIS DOESN'T HAVE IT!  There are so many trash reviews right now.  Look the 450 model has ANC, the 350 model does not.  Don't be fooled by those bad reviews.  I intentionally bought this model over the 450 because from experience I know that Sennheiser does not do good ANC.  Sony and Bose are where you look.Sound quality: above average for wireless headphones.  The bass is muddy and never impactful.  The mids are overly recessed and the treble is too much.  It gives the headphones a dull, thin sound.  A bit of an exaggeration but it is like listening to AM radio.  It is NOT at all the Sennheiser house sound (rich warm, dark and highly detailed).  It is also not terribly detailed.  But it is better than most wireless headphones that have that consumer-grade sound of incredibly flabby, muddy mid and upper bass boost.  The best I've heard are from Beyerdynamics, AKG and Audio-Technica but their offerings are much more expensive or lacking in features or are poorly made.Comparison to the 4.40: this headphone is the spiritual successor to the 4.40.  The 4.40 was a terrible headphone.  It had an audible noise floor (I listen to classical music at low to mid-volume so the hiss was always present).  It had poor support for codecs and did not have much in the way of volume or dynamics.  Finally, the 4.40 took micro-usb for charging.  This headphone is much better.  Sennheiser clearly redesigned their wireless headphone.  There is no noise floor on the 350.  It supports nearly every codec you can think of.  It uses bluetooth 5.0 and has usb-c with fast charging.Verdict: at $100 you can't do any better.  It has the best sound quality, build and features at that price point and comes from a name brand.  Notice I didn't praise it to the moon.  Temper your expectations.  It is impossible to find great SQ or great NC on wireless headphones without setting a pretty steep budget.  And there are no wireless headphones that hit both out of the park.  It is unfortunate that Sony and Bose have such great ANC but such lousy SQ, and all audiophile brands put so much effort into SQ but almost no effort into NC.
There are few aptx-LL or low-latency capable headphones on market (the newer Bluetooth 5.3 standard might change this situation?). This one works without connectivity issue, with basic app support for firmware update.My only complaint is the size of buttons and LED, too tiny for my parents who use this to watch TV.
I bought a pre-Bluetooth set of wireless Sennheisers TR120 years ago.  They lasted a long time, were very comfortable.  With new computers, I bought my first set of Bluetooths last month.  They suffer from fingernail-on-the-blackboard cutouts due to interference of the type described all over the web.  I'm  cleared to return them and will replace with a set of wire phones.  These fold up and are less comfortable than the 120s were, to boot.  Anyway if you know Bluetooth will work for you go for it.  And Sennheiser makes quality products.

Now I've had raycon products in the past and I have to say these headphones where a game changer for me. Right away when I took them out the box they looked more expensive then they are! Again that's a good thing when buying products but do they perform just as well?The performance on these headphones do literally what they advertise. No bs most say the bass is too much of loud but I don't see the problem. As someone who makes music the sound quality of these are almost on par with my studio headphones I use to have. I replaced those with these.The nosie cancellation doesn't block out EVERY sound but it does what it's supposed to. Low level traffic and footsteps or anything you do outside you won't hear.It gives you complete immersion and makes you feel like you're actually in front of the song. What's better is the awareness mode that allows you to still listen to music and the things around you. many times I've used it while listening to conversations and never have to take the headphones off or pass my music so that's a plus definitely recommend this product.The battery life on this.....Man let me tell you, these stayed alive after the first full charge for 6 days not joking. Though I didn't use most of the functions on it which does drain battery life but if I used them it'd stay alive for 5 or 4. But honestly if you have the Aux cord you can use this even when it's dead so you don't have to stop.
Bought these for my husband's birthday. He loves them. Uses them at gym and for work. Connects to his laptop and has good sound quality with virtual meetings.Great values for the price.
These are a great value at $100. I been using these for two full weeks and still have 30% battery life on a single charge. The noise cancelling is pretty good and they stay on my head no matter what work out I'm doing.
The sound is very clear comfortable to wear
The bass is really punchy.  Headphones are super comfortable and easy to setup.  I use these for workouts, but you could really use for any activities.
These are well built!  My daughter is very hard on her headphones and has had these for several months with no problems!  I would buy these again!
Good sound and various profiles so you can tailor it. They are not as comfortable as some more expensive ones but for the price, very good
I've only had them for a little while, but they're comfortable and the sound is good. The only minor issue I can find is i can't hear much difference between noise cancellation mode being on or off. Overall, pretty nice.
Good headphones, nice sound, reasonably comfortable, and great battery life, however it comes with a huge annoying flaw. The "Low Battery" warning is a disaster. It's unbelievably loud. Like jarring. I'll be enjoying music or a podcast, and out of nowhere "LOW BATTERY!!!!" is shouted into my ears. Once my heart rate returns to a healthy range, the headphones do it again! And again. And again still. Seriously, I've gotten 4 warnings in 9 minutes. I might have 15 mins of battery life left, enough to finish my podcast, but I can't handle that god awful audio prompt every two minutes. Otherwise, they're okay. A little hot after a while. Expected. For the price they're a good deal. But they really need to fix that one annoying as hell flaw.
I know these aren't the most expensive headphones out there, but for the price and its competition with Beats, I was still expecting something more than what I got.Firstly, these are made so cheaply. The majority of it is plastic and the plastic is very thin, especially on the muffs. It sounds like the cheap plastic they use to make kid's meals toys is the best description I can give, and those toys usually break after one or two uses.Secondly, the pleather used on the muffs and headband is way too loose. I'm not sure if it's the pleather itself or the cheap foam they shoved underneath to give it a faux plush look, but it looks like they used too much pleather material or didn't add enough material to the inside to fill the space. I'm honestly not even convinced the headband is made with anything stronger than cardboard.Speaking of the faux plush look of the muffs and the headband, it is just that. Whatever foam material they use completely deflates the second you put it on, even with the band adjusted to fit loosely. I don't understand what the goal was with that. Again, I know these are not top of the line headphones, but for $100 I expected just a little bit of quality. I've had $49 Logitech's that were made better than this.The sound quality is decent. That's really the only thing going for it in my opinion, but I can get the same on a cheaper headset.

Bought these along with the Sony XM5 to compare to my existing Bose 700.Comfort:The Bose 700 I don't find very comfortable, namely the headband, being rather thin, it puts pressure on the top of my head after a couple hours. The Sony had this problem initially, but then I started loosening the headband as much as possible, and being a very light pair, I stopped having that particular issue. All in all I found the Sony much more comfortable than the 700. I could see some folks saying it's more comfortable than the Momentum 4s. However I disagree about that. For me the Momentum 4 are the most comfortable. It has very soft ear pads, much like the Sony. Granted the M4s are heavier, but the weight is distributed very well across the headband, better than the Sony's imo. All in all, it's a close call and the Sony's are really well done comfort wise. Super light and super cushy pads. Could see a reasonable person going in either direction for the win here.Sound quality:I think the XM5 are pretty close to the Bose 700 and could see folks going either way depending on your signature preferences. Personally think I like the Sony a bit better, just more lively than the more neutral Bose. Both are in the same league though. The M4s are way better sound quality wise plain and simple. They're not in the same league. Heck, they're not even playing in the same sport. Find myself listening to music way more often during the day simply because I enjoy it that much more. This is the reason I'm ultimately sticking with the M4s. And it's not a hard decision.Noise cancelation:Sony XM5 are simply the best. If you're buying headphones to block out the sound of your partner playing annoying tiktok vids, this is the one to get. M4s have pretty good noise canceling too, but the Sony's are way better here imo. Bose sits between the XM5 and the M4s, maybe just a little better than the M4sMic sound quality:I'm work remotely with multiple meetings throughout the day so I've done extensive testing on all three models. In a nutshell if you don't have any special requirements, all of them do a great job. In quiet conditions I prefer the the M4 a little better than the others, my voice just has more body to it, but again, it's plenty clear using any of these models. In noisy conditions, the Sony XM5 are way better than the rest in isolating your voice and minimizing background noise. Simply incredible! The 700 and M4 handled the background noise a bit differently. My voice is clearer on the M4s in noisy conditions whereas the Bose cancel out more background noise at the cost of sacrificing clarity. When there's lots of noise, the Bose can reduce your voice to the point where it's super difficult to hear what you're saying. The M4s will allow more background noise through, but my voice remains super clear and louder than other sounds coming through.One feature I really like about the M4s, the one and only button they have (making it super easy to find) becomes a mute button during calls, zoom or google meetings. Really enjoy that feature as I could walk around the house and unmute myself if I need to talk. A voice tells you if it's muted or unmuted so you know where you're at. No more flushing the toilet while running out of the room hoping no-one on the meeting heard it.The background noise canceling of the XM5 during calls was so good, it made me really want to keep them. But ultimately good music sound quality is something I'd enjoy more often since I'm not often taking meetings in super noisy conditions. Also the M4s have the mute button I could use if I do find myself in that situation.Summery:If you want incredible noise cancelation while listening to music, taking calls or meetings, the Sony XM5 are the one to get. They are head and shoulders above the competition in this respect. If you wanna be wowed by how amazing your music sounds, renewing your love for music you didn't even know you had, the M4s are for you. These are the main areas where there is substantial difference. Sony and Seinheiser truly impressed me in their respective areas of expertise. Aside from those standout areas, these are all great headsets. Even the Bose 700 is a really solid headset. Unfortunately it wasn't able to differentiate itself when compared to these two titans of industry. Noise canceling is great, just can't touch the Sony's. Sound quality also great, just can't touch the M4s. Arguable the Bose are the slickest looking headset of the bunch though.
Note:I am a trained listener - first as a former musician, second as an engineer, and lastly as a military operator.Devices used for testing/review:Samsung S22 Ultra (*disclaimer: Samsung owns Harman/AKG/etc., so their audio software is well above average)iPhone 12 Pro MaxApple Airpods MaxDragonfly Cobalt + USB C connector (for the wired headphones)Grado RS2eBeyerdynamic T1 v2Random air purifier on maxMusic tested:Houkiboshi by Younha (vocal, piano, guitar J-Pop song/anime soundtrack)Flash by Rocket Punch (standard K-Pop song)The The by Rocket Punch (dance K-Pop song)Wow by DIA ('new-retro' K-Pop song)Design overview:1. I purposely bought the white model - very clean/modern look, but perhaps a little too minimalistic. Also looks like many other competing wireless headphones ><.2. A little on the small side. I have fairly average-sized ears, and the earcups barely cover the lobes, which is great for passive noise cancellation, but I did have to adjust the headband quite a bit. In comparison, the Airpods have a self-adjusting system similar to my wired AKG K712 i.e., the headband will adjust to your head size.3. Plasticky compared to the Apple's metal frame. It's kind of like my AKG vs. my Beyerdynamic. In terms of build quality feel, 'you get what you pay for'.Comfort:1. Earpads: this is what most travelers will care about. Like with any headphone, I adamantly recommend everyone review manufacturer site, legitimate review sites, etc. The Sennheiser M4 has pleather pads as you can tell. No need to say that they'll get hot after a while - common knowledge. Grado loses here for obvious reasons, then the Sennheiser, then the Beyerdynamic, and finally the winner the Airpods. Apple was smart in using mesh - breathable and lightweight.2. Headband: this is not as big a deal as earpads. None of the test headphones were terrible, but some were still better than others. The Sennheiser uses a medium with pleather band covered by fabric, which looks nice. In a huge switcheroo, Grado wins with their thin industrial band, followed by Apple's thin metal, then the Sennheiser, and finally the Beyerdynamic with their high-end but a little too thick leather curve.Sound and Noise cancellation:1. Obviously, a wired headphone connected to a top end USB DAC will beat any wireless one, but both the Apple and Sennheiser did well here. And they still cost less than the Beyerdynamic to boot.2. Neither wired headphones are noise cancelling nor do they claim to be, but being semi-closed/open, you would think the Beyerdynamic might do ok, but no joy.3. Both the Apple and Sennheiser are very good at noise cancellation, but not perfect, but the Apple was clearly better, even with all Sennheiser settings at max.Accessories:1. This is a fun one. Apple being Apple, gives you jack (no pun intended). An USB C to Lightning cable, infamous bra case.2. Sennheiser, meanwhile, gives you an outdated (haven't seen these in years) airplane double connector, 2.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable, USB C to A cable, and finally a nice cloth case (my color combo was gray).3. Additional note: wired headphones, being wired, both the Grado and Beyerdynamic gave 3.5mm to 6.3mm audio adapters. Being a high-end model, the T1 also came with a case.Final thoughts:1. I normally don't use wireless headphones, at most, a Bluetooth amp, the aforementioned USB DAC and one of my usual wired cans. But my brother convinced my to try a pair for an upcoming trip. They really are convenient.2. The unfortunate thing I found in my search, as of this writing (9/30/2022), there are no modern (i.e., BT 5) really high-end e.g., T1 level wireless headphones out there. They all seem to top out around the $400 mark, which sounds a lot, but not for a ultra high end wired headphone.3. Of the 10 or so better choices out there, what I would recommend depends on your music style, phone, use/need. Loyal Apple users - Airpods Max, Android users - this Sennheiser M4, hardcore must have the best music quality users - wait - niche uber manufacturers are getting there.
Credentials: have used/owned the sennheiser hd558 (open back/wired), momentum 1 (closed back/wired), pcx550 (closed back/wireless) and now this very sensible/practical looking closed back/wireless momentum 4 (also have the fidelio and some other random philips in the past while had gotten the in-ear wired momentums for wife but never used them myself..also have used Sony, Bose, AKG, BnO but not ones which can be reasonably compared with these...I hear Sonys comparative model has better ANC but I can't comment)...so far so good..preliminary-have been using them since 11Oct2022 so a 2 day review, for what its worth:Pros: build is robust, very durable/flexible (so far) but in Fiji's temperate tropics things/textiles tear down quicker at times but with good care, I believe these cans will last well enough (the materials feel of quality in usual sennheiser fashion). Looks are welcome as mine is black and I like the no nonsense practical appearance (don't really miss the previous urban momentum look since it's irrelevant because merit, or performance is key). These cans have an awesome sound stage and music is crisp and bassy (on Windows PC, and android devices..not into apple yet), handles all sorts of music (pop, rock, alt, classical, instrumental, country, reggae, edm, techno/trance) very well. Calls are clear, has a decent mic and touch controls are snappy/responsive (much better than my older pcx). Bluetooth is the latest so not detailing that (overall, no connectivity issues on Windows or android). Can be used as wireless or wired and for me the battery has so far performed well (arrived at 40% charge, has usbC so fast charging and hasn't run out of juice since charging it 100%...is now at 60% with an uptime of about 21 hours playing music, PC gaming and youtubing. No issues with long wearing as pads on both ears are comfy as is the head padding and no uncomfortable ear heating for me so far (had slept for 06hrs after wearing them for 09hrs l, then on again when awake). ANC is decent and noticeable but am not experienced on this but can't complain.Cons: expensive for Fiji dollars given current exchange rates vis-a-vis USD pricing and shipping plus import duty but not a deal breaker as a worthwhile buy if using regularly where sound quality is more important than saving money.Bottom line: would recommend if for quality music and gaming sounds and also excellent mobile/handsfree experience but not if you're looking for a studio level audiophile experience obviously (Snape voice). Buy it if you want quality wireless, all rounder headphones and can part with a modest amount as there are cheaper as well as dearer cans, but for what they are and do, the momentum 4 wireless cans are simply the best (Le Tina Turner vibes).
Comfortable. Intuitive touch controls. Battery life. Design.Prior to purchase I did lots of research (thank you early adopters that do video reviews and websites that do qualitative reviews). I purchased these over other similarly priced brands based on the available features, price and design style. I have no remorse for the price I have paid.A little more depth:First, sound was a big priority for me -- I wanted a pair of headphones that reproduced sound/music as closely as an original artist may have desired. I found a website, soundguys.com, that provided a frequency-response (an audio-sweep starting from the 10's of Hz to the 10's of kHz is played through the headphones then the output noise difference is measured) graph for the headphones showing a very good sound reproduction (compared to a similarly priced set of Sony headphones these were more true to the input audio sweep).Second was design. I am a big fan of having the cups of the headphones attached to the headband via the swiveling 'pitch fork' design. Mounted/affixed to the middle of the/a headphone-cups. From an engineering/physics perspective, this means the pushing/pressing force exerted by the headband through the cups is centered from the middle of the cups, as opposed to the tops of the cup's--which invariably results in the pushing pressure being more towards the top of the cups (assumptions based on the XM5's design).Third. Comfort. The somewhat flat headband with its padding is forgettable and the pressure it supplies to the cups to the sides of one's (average size) head is sufficient -- maybe a little on the lite side. Also, the inside (head side) of the headband is a rubbery-like material, so no fears of hair/scalp oils dirtying a fabric there.Lastly, a subjective review of the sound, ANC, and call quality. I think the sound is amazing! The ANC is super cool. I've worn these on public transit (daily on the bus, and weekly on the train) and finally feel like I won't have any hearing damage from having to listen to the drone of the engine or cabin noise. You will still have some awareness of sounds around you, especially those of higher pitch/tone, but if you have music going (half volume for me) you will not hear any thing. Pass-through mode is also quite nice, though sometimes other's voices may sound quite (again, due to using half volume).Call quality is great. I held a phone call wherein I had a fan blowing on my head (wind noise). Neither I or my caller could hear any of the noise from the fan.Since owning the headphones, Sennheiser has released a firmware update for the ANC. Before and after the update I cannot empirically say I've notice any difference. Knowing Sennheiser will push updates to further improve the product is also reassuring (though for this price point, I believe most companies are doing this).Several sites/videos say that a similarly priced set of Sony's has better ANC than these, but I'll argue that you don't need a pair of Sony's to enjoy/receive a similar experience!Very subjective final thought: These (in white) look better than the competition.
I loved these headphones (Momentum 4). It quickly became my favorite, even better than the Sony MX5. The sound was awesome with a full spectrum down to the deepest base without muddy low frequencies as with nearly all other headphones including the MX5. I used these every day for just over a month to put me just out of Amazon return window. Suddenly the right speaker started crackling and popping. I was in such disbelief that this was happening. It was so sad for me that I couldn't listen to them anymore. I was very disappointed, and I really wanted them to work! So I ordered the another pair from Best Buy, and I ordered another from Amazon. Yeah, I really wanted these to work! The same day the Best Buy pair arrived and I started listening to them, it took about 4 hours before this one like the other one started crackling and popping, except it was not as bad, and it was in the left speaker. I was so much more disappointed! Fortunately I was able to return this one to Best Buy right away. I also cancelled the second order from Amazon. I really want to know what's up! I tried everything to make the crackling and popping go away. I restarted my phone, updated the headphone firmware, nothing worked. Now I have a broken pair and I guess I should use the 2-year warranty to have Sennheiser fix it or replace it. Can't return them to Amazon. If I could trust that the next one I receive will last, I would go ahead and get another one right now. Just so you know, I collect Bluetooth headphones, and I have over 30 pairs including the best of Sony, Bose, and other premium brands. I've never had an issue with any of these other pairs. This sucks! My rating of one star is solely due to this issue with two separate pairs. If the pair worked, I would rate them a solid five stars! They are AWESOME! There hope this issue can be fixed. I want my Sennheiser Momentum 4 back! One star should elevate this concern so that others are cautious when they buy one, and know that it may fail within so many hours of use. Sennheiser please make this right for me.
Sound quality on these is GREAT - No complaints whatsoever. Music sounds good, TV dialogue is easily understandable, full range of sound is audible. Mic quality is good, but not as top of the line as the sound.Battery life is pretty in line with what's advertised. Expect to charge at least twice weekly if you use your headphones heavily.I'm not crazy about the touch controls. They seem finicky to me, and don't give you good feedback. Instead of being able to adjust transparency on a percentage scale, I'd much rather have a quick switch for going between fully transparent and fully noise cancelling.I had some problems initially with pairing and set up. When connected to my Windows 10 PC, they appear as two different sound devices - Headphones & headset. Quality when connected as a headset is terrible, so make sure it's connected as headphones. Headset connection can be disabled in output devices if it's connecting the wrong one as default, but make sure it's left enabled in the input devices list or you won't be able to use the microphone.The app is...Not great. No desktop version as far as I can tell, so you have to control it from a phone or emulator. I ended up turning off almost all of the app features. Auto adjusting noise cancellation didn't seem to work properly, and I have no idea what "Comfort calling" is because most of the app features don't have descriptions (This one isn't listed in the manual either). On head detection has annoyed me with every device I've ever had it on, but I'll concede that before I turned it off this was the least terrible implementation that I've experienced.Initial pairing experience was troublesome, but now that all my devices (Desktop, laptop, phone) are paired I'm able to transition between them all pretty smoothly. Occasionally I'll have to turn bluetooth off on one device or another because I'll get continuous "Connected/Disconnected" messages while listening on a different device.Bottom line, if audio quality is your most important factor in looking for headphones, you'll probably be happy with these - I definitely am. That being said, they aren't the most user friendly headphones currently. I'm hoping that software/firmware updates might improve the experience, and I'll update this review if that happens.
I'm borderline obsessed with Sennheiser, and gave these headphones an honest try; I really wanted to like them, but until they fix the firmware, I couldn't recommend these to anyone. Tested on multiple devices, all of which are up to date.To future-proof my review (because I won't remember to edit my review once the firmware problems have been addressed), I rated these 4 stars based on the assumption that there will be a future fix to the firmware problems. If taking the firmware into account, I think I'd rate these 2 stars (as of 8/31/2022).Pros:These headphones have quality sound, probably on par with the price point. Not significantly better than my PXC 550-II's, but they do have a bit more depth and bass.Their noise cancellation is good, but not as good as my Bose QC35‚Äôs, which is to be expected.The battery life is incredible. I don't think I'm getting 60 hours (volume kept at around 20-40%), but they're still awesome.Cons:These are nowhere near as comfortable as my Sennheiser PXC 550-II headphones. They put more pressure on my ears/temples, and the headband is way firmer. My head is aching after about 30 minutes of use.There are significant firmware issues (my firmware is up to date, as of 8/31/22):When using the auto power off mode, they turn on (and sync to your phone) any time they‚Äôre moved. This will of course silence your phone‚Äôs alerts, as they‚Äôre playing over the headphones that you didn‚Äôt mean to turn on.When using the on-head detection, they keep turning on and off while they're sitting around my neck.Whenever I answer my phone (iPhone 12 Pro Max) and change the output to these headphones it just hangs up the phone. Haven't tried answering using the headphone's touch controls, it's possible that would work.While the transparency mode is a nice feature, it's almost laughable compared to my AirPod Pro's and Sony WF-1000XM4's. It sounds just barely better than wearing non-noise cancelling headphones.These can connect to 2 devices at a time, but when switching between paired (and connected) devices (for example: listening to audio on my tablet, when I get a text alert on my phone, which interrupts tablet audio for a second, before switching back to tablet again), and whenever I answer my phone, as mentioned above, audio quits playing over my headphones. My phone says it's still connected, but it doesn't show up as an output in any apps. I have to reconnect it to my phone to get it working again.Whenever I pair them with a new device, it disconnects from existing connected devices. I have to reconnect afterward.As much as I want to like these headphones, until Sennheiser fixes these software issues, it's just not worth the hassle.
I'm coming from the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless headphones that I've been using for basically everything over the past few years. I bought these new headphones primarily because of AptX-Adaptive, their glowing battery life, and the fact that my M3W were starting to wear down a bit.Let me reiterate; I use these for EVERYTHING. Everything from my phone, iPad, multiple PCs, planes, etc. etc. If you want to use these on PC, I strongly suggest in either an AptX or preferably an AptX-Adaptive transmitter (see the Creative BT-W4) to avoid unnecessary latency. It's an absolute must if you're gaming though you will lose the ability to make calls.Regardless, these sound fantastic. I had no complaints about the M3W and while these aren't a significant upgrade, they do sound clearer and more crisp. The build quality is tricky. On one hand, they lack the metal frame that the M3W had that made them unique and confidence-inspiring. These are almost entirely plastic and their uniqueness has been subdued that it can easily be mistaken for countless other pairs. That being said, they feel solid and the plastic does not feel ready to snap at any point. The earcups in particular are an upgrade in both fitment and leather quality. They lose the ability to fold like the M3W but instead you get a slim HARDSHELL carrying case. I get why some people are against them no longer folding but as someone who constantly takes them out of my backpack, I LOVE the slimmer case.The capacitive touch functions I'm not sure how I feel about yet. The only physical button doubles as a manual on/off and a pairing button. The rest is controlled by the cover of the right ear cuff. Most of the functions are fine and intuitive, but to switch between ANC, off, and transparent hearing, you need to do a weird pinch like you would to zoom on a touch screen. It's particularly weird because there's multiple levels so you need to do it multiple times. I'm sure I'll get used to it but I would've preferred a physical button or switch like the M3W.ANC is good. It's NOT as good as Sony's but it's not far off. I can't say much about the battery life as I've only had them for a day but all reviews are backing up Sennheiser's claims of 60h which is literally class-leading. The Android app for fine tuning settings and EQ is fine. Nothing to write home about. Multipoint connection (pairing to two devices at once) is back though it's not a feature I intend to use very often.All in all, I'm very happy. They're expensive but the price is competitive with their rivals. The main draw for me towards Sennheiser has been AptX support. It's something that most of the competition is missing and as a large amount of my usage is gaming, it's absolutely necessary. But the sound quality is great. The features are great. I'd highly recommend these if you're in the market.
Although it didn't look good at my first glance during unboxing (because of the instruction stickers on it), the headset is solid and has a good feeling on skin. The design of the appearance is modest; however, it provides a modern and clean outlooking when fit on the head.The ANC is good. It may not completely block the environmental sounds, but the most annoying parts have been blocked. This makes it a good experience to wear it even without playing music.This headphone possesses a balanced, neutral, and smooth sound. Just like other Sennheiser headphones, this set requires a certain run-in time. I can still feel changes in sound after two weeks of use and feel the potential of the set. However, like other Bluetooth headsets, the sound quality drops significantly when used with Android phone, compared to the case with Surface pro 7. (I don't have a mac or iPhone, maybe someone can share their experiences. The mark on the box says "Made for iPhone|iPad" but "Works with android" lol)I would say this is the one you need when going out or going to office.
If you‚Äôre looking for a set of headphones that looks good, sounds good, has premium feel and effectively cancels noise immersing you in a world of sound? Stop your search and get this pair!I was on the marketing for headphones that would do all the above and not feel cheap. Glad to say I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Some highlights:1. Premium look and feel. You get your money‚Äôs worth here. Hands down. Nothing feels cheap. I‚Äôm especially a huge fan of the textured headband. The clamp force is comfortable. Hardly feel it pinch the ears and can easily get through a gym session or air travel without discomfort.2. AMAZING SOUND QUALITY! Lots can be said but I‚Äôll summarize by saying these headphones do sound great Justice! Mids, highs and lows are equally balanced making music sound INCREDIBLY GOOD! Bass is perfect, not muddy or overbearing. Mids and highs, crisp! You also have the option to customize preferences in the downloadable app.3. Carrying case is perfect size. Not too big or small. Just right. It contains charging cable and 1/4 Jack for plugging into external devices.Overall, there are zero complaints so far. I‚Äôd recommend this pair to anyone looking for great headphones. Even go as far as saying they‚Äôre better than Sony!

These headphones are mainly for beginners who want balance audio for closed backs. It's relevtly cheap for this kind of amazing sound quality and sound stage. And they're also design for listening to music mainly too. If you do calls, like for gaming, then you might need to look at one of Sennheiser's head sets instead.My only wish for these headphones is replaceable cups when the time comes when my greasy head decays the cups away.
Sennheiser is known for quality and these portable-ish headphones are a great option all around. I got them for when I travel as they're light and fold, but they sound so good that you can use them as your primary headphones.
I like them a lot overall. They are not perfect but Im a perfectionist. For a couple of years I used a lower priced Sennheiser set and though it had very good sound I had to hold the cans tight to my ears to hear it. If they were just on my ears the sound was very poor.These are far away better than the ones I described above. There is almost no improvement holding to cans tight and the sound is very good. They are a little tight on me and thats probably why they sound so good without pressure. If I just had to sit with them on it would bother me right away but as Im distracted by classic rock I dont notice it. In a couple of years I want to pay more and see what I get but for right now Im content.
I recommend
If you like your music with a little more bass these are not your headphones.  The oneaudio A70 kicks these HD300 headphones all over the place.  The HD300's are better if your not one to rock out and just use these for your zoom or teams.  It does have better sound quality, but who cares if your rockin out man!
Got these to use for podcasts. The name is highly regarded and they do not disappoint. Great sound and comfort for an amazing price.Highly recommend
Okay, first of all for fifty dollars they should at least have a mic and Bluetooth. The wire does not get tangle and it is long enough tobe connect to divise in your back pocket or back pack.
I bought this both as an upgrade to the 201s I have had at my work desk for years and with the hope that the single cord on one side would be less of a bother than the Y-cord of the 201s.I have to say, this was NOT the upgrade I hoped for.  The sound quality is good - I'm not an audiophile by any means, so YMMV - but the ear cups are noticeably narrower. Between the snugger fit to the ear and the smaller earcup... ouch. Sure, it blocks out noise, but I can't wear them for more than 30-40 minutes. The 201s I could leave on for 3 hours or more.Also, the cord is short, which I did not expect. (Well, short as in 'not the long one on the cheap version' but only the standard 3' length.) I keep getting yanked  when I forget I have a very limited range of motion from my computer while wearing these.All in all, I am out $50 and annoyed. [And with the current global pandemic situation, returning anything is a gamble for safety when I leave the house, so I really am stuck with these.]
They sound good and are comfortable. They look kind of dopey though. For $25 more the sennheiser HD1 has a better sound profile, feel more comfortable and has a mic. These are nice but they don‚Äôt feel like a premium product.
I've worn 2 Skullcandy Lowriders Blue within 2 years, both unable to hear audio/video files online/offline.I've also worn 2 Sennheiser HD 202 Black within 2 years, both also unable to hear audio/video files online/offline.It's an upgrade from Bose - SoundLink¬Æ Wireless Around-Ear Headphones II - Black 2+ years, the ear cushions fell off the headphones after the 1st year and Bluetooth connection errors to an iPad and a laptop.I ordered Sennheiser HD 300 Closed Back, Around Ear Headphone on 2/28/2020 & received it on 3/2/2020.The order was to be delivered between 3/4/2020-2/5/2020, higher reviews because of early delivery and the rubber audio jack from the Bose - SoundLink¬Æ Wireless Around-Ear Headphones II - Black broke apart.There is noise cancelling, but 3 year warranty coverage was bought because my bad experiences with headphones.

In this technical review I will explain and gives a few examples why the HD650 are the excellent headphones that they are.  I'll also dispel a few misconceptions about its performance.  Initially, I was unsure whether it was really worth buying these expensive (unfortunately now even more expensive) headphones, since the HD650 has earned a special reputation on certain large forum sites on the Internet.  Apparently the HD650 is great, but at the same time is "veiled", with a "dark sound signature"; it's also "hard to drive", "picky about amps, scaling with more expensive amps into the >$1000 territory".  It created confusion in me and I thought to myself if all that really makes any sense.  So I first researched electro-acoustic principles on an informative blog and learned some truth that made logical sense.  Then I finally purchased it.Cosmetically, the HD650 has a nice clear-coat finish over the titanium-silver (actually pearl grey) color scheme, where the small multi-colored sparkly flecks of paint can be seen around sunlight.  Even the outer side of the grille gets the sparkly treatment, while the inner side is bare stainless steel.  The stock cable (which is just fine BTW!) is thick and very supple.  It only has subtle low frequency microphonics when tapping it with fingers, and none when it's rubbed against clothing.  The fit of the headphones is secure, and stays put during left/right and angled up/down head movements.  The somewhat strong initial clamping force lessens over time.  The modular construction of the headphones makes disassembly easy.  For instance, tilting the ear cups downward a bit past the resistance as if trying to lay them flat unsnaps the upper half of the ring from the central hubs.  Once the upper half of the ring is then pulled out, place the ear cup in your lap with the cable entrance side facing you, and using your fingers in that area, firmly push away the lower trim piece which simultaneously causes the grille to come off as well!  Replacing the headband pad is simple.  (Remove the capsules beforehand.)  I managed to get the edge of my thumb just behind the Made in Ireland plastic stopper and pushed it out quickly and forcefully.  Then extend the metal band until it comes out.  Repeat for the other side.  Now slide the pad out.  It is not glued on.  To reassemble, first carefully feed the edge of the pad all the way through the narrow groove of the plastic arc.  Then put the left and right bands through the second groove behind the pad and snap back in the stoppers.Now, with all that out of the way, the best and easiest way to evaluate headphone performance is with 20Hz to 20kHz sine wave sweeps (download the logarithmic one at audiocheck.net) and pink noise.  If it sounds even and clean, then that would carry over into normal use, since sine waves are the basic building blocks of sound reproduction.  Similarly, a TV display's performance is seen with gray-scale linearity, RGB coordinates for gamut accuracy close to BT. 709, white balance targeted to 6500K, etc.  If it performs well there, such a display would be accurate for normal program material.  For audio, the sine wave sweep should not contain frequency sections that get your attention in terms of peaks, valleys, ringing or other anomalies.  I'm happy to report that the HD650 has a remarkably even and linear response during the sweep!  The so-called "mid-bass hump" isn't even perceived as being louder than the 500Hz area.  A critical area (especially for female voice and higher notes from strings and wind instruments) is from around 700Hz to 3kHz.  It is totally even there!  The HD650 does a fantastic job in that portion of the spectrum as it's incredibly natural and transparent sounding.  It's also very easy to hear the treble frequencies become finer sounding during the upward progression.  Pink noise is smooth and balanced.  It's virtually impossible to discern any imbalance between the higher frequency portion of the noise with the lower frequency portion.  I would like to point out that the compensated frequency response graph at Inner Fidelity shows a 15dB notch around 5 to 6kHz compared to 1kHz.  But actually there is no audible recession of 15 decibels in that area when listening to the sweep!  It is flat when listening by ear.  That notch is responsible for these headphones not imparting harshness and sibilance.  There is a slight audible dip at about 7kHz and another at 10kHz.  But after that the high treble is actually nicely extended and present, especially in the 12 to 16kHz region.  At the other end of the spectrum, the deep bass lacks a few dB of rumble in the lowest octave.  Overall, the HD650 has a substantially flat response and a lifelike timbre.  And the HD650's wonderful transient response can be attributed to its high frequency extension, high damping factor from the amplifier for the lower frequencies, and the low mass aluminum coil.  Everything is critically damped.I also conducted a comparison with the HD598 and HD428.  The HD598 lacks the bass response, bass weight, fuller body of the low mids to the start of the upper mids (200Hz to 750Hz) of 650.  But the 598 gets into big trouble with the lower treble and beyond.  I can detect a bit of a dip after 1kHz and then there are a couple of sharp audible peaks and a bit of shrillness from around 2kHz to 5kHz with an indistinctness over all the high frequencies afterwards.  Its pink noise has some emphasis in that area (the 'tssshhh' sound), with the lower frequencies being slightly quieter.  Hence, its sonic character is lean and bright in the upper mids and transition to the low treble.  It's easy to notice that female vocals don't have a natural timbre and cymbals lack detail compared to the HD650.  Onto the HD428.  A little bit of distortion and looseness is heard in the lower bass area but progresses quite evenly until around 3 to 4kHz where it has quite a big noticeable drop, and comes back up to about 10kHz and then gently rolls off the rest of the highs.  Its pink noise is tilted towards warmth with the lower frequencies a bit louder than the higher ones.  Though Headroom's graph shows a weak bass response for the HD428, it does not take into account how the human ear interprets low frequency resonance inside the closed ear cups.  (A quick sweep or 3 second chirp also reveals an echo-knock inside the right cup).  Bass is quite tight, but lacks real impact or weight (except for the fabric material tickling the ears), even though it gives the impression of a little more bass than the 650 due to resonance (but that resonance affects the perception of low frequency transients).  But at least the 428 does not have that harsh low and mid treble of the 598!  It seems more like a 650 with a subdued, mellow or recessed response from the low treble and beyond that, but it's a surprisingly clean sounding can for the price!  Its treble is more articulate than the 598s.  I think it represents a superb value along with the HD448 or HD449 and is pleasant for long listening sessions too as it doesn't offend my ears like the more strident HD598.So now that we know the HD650 is actually very balanced in frequency response (which also relates to good dynamics), it's on to distortion.  It can be summed up briefly:  This headphone's distortion is inaudible!  That means pure, clean, smooth, full-bodied sound with natural harmonics beings heard leading to accurate timbre, high resolving ability and detail retrieval since there's no discernible garbage being introduced by the transducer.  There is a clear and precise differentiation of all frequencies and octaves.  Headroom's graph for the 500Hz sine wave distortion (tested at 90dB) shows the HD650 has vanishingly low levels, lower than some other high-end headphones more expensive than it.  It has a really small second harmonic and that's about it!  Higher order distortion is virtually non-existent.  The HD650 is so linear that even when turning the volume up, it still doesn't seem like it's loud enough!  The sound never gets thick or harsh.  And there is no grain at all in the sound.  The HD598 has some graininess in the mids and highs that is ever-present indicating odd order harmonic distortion.  The HD428 isn't grainy, but has a bit of a smoothed over thickness or lushness in the mids and lacks articulation, indicating even-order harmonic distortion.  But generally, the even-order harmonics are not as offensive as the odd ones.  Headroom's graphs back up what I heard from all three.  The HD650 is a real winner here.Since harmonic distortion will necessarily produce intermodulation distortion when multiples tones are present, IMD is never nice to hear.  I can back this up with an example.  Corona's Rhythm of the Night R.B.X. Euro Mix is a well-mastered Eurodance song that has a strong grinding bass.  Once the main bassline starts at 0:36, and particularly at 0:42, the HD598 outputs a significant amount of IMD at very high volume.  The bass and treble become garbled and the song becomes an unenjoyable mess.  The HD428 chokes too.  Occasional pops can be heard since the smaller driver doesn't have enough excursion capability.  The HD650 is totally unfazed by the high demands, rendering the controlled bass with clarity, impact, and weight with appreciable bone conduction as slight vibrations are also felt through the front teeth when both rows are touching.  I do not recommend listening at such high volumes for any extended length of time for obvious reasons.  In fact, I hear more nuances in the music at more moderate to low volumes.  It may not be as stimulating that way, but it's better quality listening.I also found three easy examples of frequency response differences among all three cans!  In the CD Maxi Single of DJ BoBo's Somebody Dance With Me, at the female vocal section "I've got this feeling, somebody dance with me!", the words "feeling" and "me" are emphasized.  With the HD428, they are recessed in amplitude and thus a bit dull and lacking in dynamics.  With the HD598, that pitch is where a narrow peak occurs, so it's shrill and bright sounding there.  And with the HD650, the response is perfectly balanced with controlled dynamics.  Likewise, with 2 Unlimited's No Limits, the female vocal part "There's no limit!"  the "limit" is a similar pitch to the above example and will exhibit the same thing.  Again, the HD650 has such a wonderful and natural timbre in the critical high mids.  And an easy example of the HD598's emphasis in the upper mid to low treble transition is Sonic the Hedgehog 3's spin-dash sound effect.  It is very loud and strident.  On the HD650, it's so clean, balanced, and it's easy to hear the real clarity and "fineness" of that sound.  Now which headphone is more veiled? ;)  There's no hype in the highs with the HD650.  Hyped-up highs seem to be the new audiophile Flavor of the Times.In terms of source material requirements, lossless files or 320kbps MP3s would provide optimal sound quality.  128kbps MP3s sound thinner, particularly in the bass and midrange, due to the missing data.  Also, songs whose average volume range from about -12dB to -18dB FS will showcase the excellent micro and macro dynamics and effortless sound projection of these headphones.  The majority of pop, rock, and dance music up to the mid-1990s hover in that range, whereas nowadays most music is unfortunately compressed to a loud overall level with hardly any dynamic range.Next up is the physical inspection of the transducers.  The HD650's 40mm Duofol diaphragm (part number 600129 minisys) has a large dome with a noticeably spherical or rounded surface area.  Although the dome's diameter is slightly larger than the HD598's, the latter's dome is flatter and deflated looking in comparison to the 650's.  The HD428 has a very tiny dome and voice coil (the latter seems to be only about 10mm), which will naturally limit its bass performance.The last section is the awesome spatial sound.  With the HD650 the stereo image is psycho-acoustically perceived as occurring in a free and open space.  It is instantly recognized by the auditory system like so.  I get no sense of the ear cups creating any sort of boundary to the sound.  Whether it's real-life acoustic or synthesized music, I can sense the soundstage size of all the different songs I have in a realistic way that's absolutely natural and also true to the source.Don't get too caught up in Sennheiser's marketing when they say 45 degree angled baffles by themselves automatically create a speaker-like sound as that may create a sighted or expectation bias.  There's a near negligible difference in the radiating point of a mono signal when I listened to angled (HD598) and straight (HD650) baffle design headphones.  Yet the HD650 easily beats the HD598 in width, depth, height, and separation even though it doesn't have angled drivers.  I'll explain why the spatial sound is superb.  The 650 has close-tolerance drivers (max. 1 dB difference) meaning both left and right channels have nearly identical phase (time) and frequency (amplitude) response, which are required for good imaging.  So in that regard, the HD650's transducers are reproducing the electrical signal (i.e. the source) with much greater accuracy.  Pink noise is perfectly centered without the slight shift towards the left like on the other two headphones.  The sine sweep is also centered all the way from 20Hz to 20kHz and does not pan to the left and right with the upper mids and treble like the lower-end models.  And compared to the other models, during stereo playback the HD650 has a solid phantom center that is present (thanks to the constantly centered sine sweep), while the left and right channels are simultaneously heard separately just outside the pinna (instead of in the ear).  Remember that "stereo" is derived from the Greek word for "solid."  And what's solid is what's in the middle.Elaborating a bit further on the previous statements, the center portion of the mix is *distinct* and is experienced as *separate* from other sounds that are placed towards the left and right while they are *simultaneously* occurring.  The asterisks denote the differences between the HD650, which has precision-manufactured drivers, and the HD598, which does not.  For example, in Madonna's "Dress You Up", the beginning part where she says "you've got style" there are reverb tails of "style" at the left and right that are separate from the main center with the HD650, but not with the HD598.  Any slight pan or shift during the sweep will result in lack of stability in stereo imaging performance.  For instance, in Phil Collins' Another Day in Paradise, during the chorus, "Cause it's another day for you, you and me in paradise" the HD428 shifts the "me" to the left of center compared to "you", since the former is an upper mid sound while the latter is a lower mid sound.  The HD650 has no flaws here.  And phase information in the music (e.g. reverberations from the instruments in the hall in classical music) seem wide open.  And the totally open chassis design further allows the sound to radiate out without contributing its own reflections.The HD650's earcups utilize a polyamide 6 and glass-fiber construction (PA6 GF) that is quiet and solid when the gloss black portion adjacent to the earpads is lightly tapped with a fingernail.  Likewise, only that nice distinctive stainless steel clang can be heard when tapping on the grille when the headphones are worn or held.  Doing the same thing to the HD598 (which utilizes conventional ABS plastic) reveals a hollow plastic sound.  Indeed, this attribute (lack of resonances in the housing) along with the aforementioned driver matching contributes to the sense of transparency in the HD650's stereo imaging, in that a pure audio image that consists only of time and level differences is formed in the mind.It's also finally worth mentioning that the HD650, since its distortion is so low, will reveal the relatively high distortion from tube amps.  So this "scaling with expensive amps" mentioned in the opening paragraph essentially means listening to the various amounts of second harmonic distortions of tube amps.  I personally would recommend pairing the HD650 with a nice solid-state amp.  It doesn't matter how much that amp costs, but about getting one that measures well (flat response, no distortion or noise), has near zero output impedance, and provides enough voltage (anything in the 2 to 3 volts RMS range is absolutely sufficient) for a powerful and exciting dynamic range.  In the audio industry, higher priced gear does not always translate into better performance.  This industry has some strange things going on now, like ridiculous price differences between the high-end models. Considering I bought the HD428, HD598, and HD650 new from Amazon last year for $50, $180, and $350 respectively, it seems a bit odd for the next two models to cost $1000 and $1500.The HD650 has a full and well-balanced frequency response, extremely low distortion with its clean, pure, and smoothly detailed sound even at very high listening levels.  It has no discernible diaphragm or earcup resonance which would otherwise produce a peak in the mid-range or treble response and has a wonderful, naturally open spatial sound.  Sennheiser may never voice a reference headphone this nicely ever again or at least for a long time to come.  What more is there to ask?  The HD650 easily satisfies the criteria for true high-fidelity reproduction.
(If you're wondering how these compare to the Sennheiser HD 600 Open Back Professional Headphone, please see the bonus section that follows this review.)These are, bar none, the most wonderful headphones I've ever heard. For perspective, I have or have had: Audio-Technica ATH-M50 (of course) and M40x, Fostex T50RP MK3, Oppo PM-3, Philips Fidelio M1MKII and L2, and both the Sennheiser HD598SE and HD600. None of these but the HD600 come close. If you're considering the HD598 as a lower-priced alternative, it's a great headphone in its own right (especially if you don't want to go down the rabbit hole of choosing a suitable amp), but there isn't as much family resemblance in the sound as you might think.Still, it was through buying the 598 that I decided to take the plunge on the 650‚ÄîSennheiser's 5xx series is clearly a gateway drug to the 6xx series, which fortunately is so good there's little reason to step up to the 700 and 800 besides bragging rights. There's a lot of warped machismo in the world of audiophilia, and to the greatest extent possible I'd like to avoid that in this review.Simply put, the 650 is about the best all-around headphone you can buy for its current Amazon price of $315.99. If you already have an amp and/or a dedicated listening setup and you've never heard these, you owe it to yourself to try them. Worst-case scenario, you don't like them and you're out $6-7 for a return label. Best-case scenario, you find out just how good (and yes, also how bad) recorded music can sound. These are very much the BMW 5-series of the headphone world: there are bigger, faster, and more expensive options, but these remain the perennial gold standard. Maybe they're not your style, but there's no denying their refinement and artistry.I think they sound absolutely perfect. Some complain they're too "laid back," even "veiled." I suspect those people just don't hear very well, because if you have sensitive hearing, "exciting" headphones are a euphemism for "death by treble." I have dog-like hearing, and most of the time it's more curse than blessing. Even with the 650, the treble can be brain-piercing with the wrong amp.As for amp recommendations, this is a contentious and fiercely debated topic. As a general rule, you should spend the most on the final device in your playback chain (speakers/headphones), and progressively less on the "upstream" components: amp, DAC, media player. Given a budget of no more than $300 for an amp, you could buy the excellent Aune B1 Class A Portable Phone/Headphone Amplifier and still have enough left over to pay for a year of streaming music. Of course, if you want to pair the 650 with "endgame" gear, by all means do! The 650 has a reputation for "scalability," meaning its sound will (allegedly) continue to improve with better amps, DACs, recordings, etc. My own gear is fairly modest, so I can't speak to how this sounds plugged into a $5,000 amp or rewired with $700 cables. I will say that it REALLY comes to life with a tube amp (I have a Darkvoice 336SE), but I completely understand if that's a can of worms you'd rather not open.All I know is that the 650 sounds good enough to be the end of the headphone rainbow for me. The audio hobby is usually a desperate, futile struggle against diminishing returns, and as far as I'm concerned, the 650 IS that threshold in the headphone world. In other words, you can spend ten times more, but it won't sound ten times better.Given that, you might be wondering whether you even need an amp with these. "Need" is a strong word, and in the context of expensive headphones it's pretty hard to maintain a sense of perspective. I've done the unthinkable and plugged these directly into my iPhone's headphone jack, and you know what? They STILL sound phenomenal, but only for easy music. What's easy music? Pop, rock, basically anything recorded to be uniformly loud. Without an amp, the 650 can fall apart on classical and jazz recordings with a wide range between loud and quiet sections‚Äîthere simply isn't enough power on tap to move the diaphragm as nimbly as this sort of music demands. If you never listen to instrumental music, you might be able to get away with not using an amp, but I can't recommend it. Buying such marvelous headphones and not amping them properly would be like buying a beautiful painting and not framing it. You can do it, but for a little more money you might as well get the full effect.Let me end with some totally subjective words that describe the sound of the 650: rich, natural, musical, effortless, clean. Now some words that could just as well be applied to a fine wine (the combination of status anxiety, groupthink, and reckless cognitive bias unites both hobbies): broad-shouldered, velvety, well-mannered, savory, harmonious. In either case, a smooth finish. :)Bonus section: HD650 vs HD600Obviously if you've read this far, you're deep enough into the audio hobby to have realized an important psychological truth about yourself: you can't leave well enough alone. Neither can I. That's why, even after falling head over heels in love with the sound of the HD650, I ordered the HD600. I just had to know.The verdict? It's almost too close to call, but for my preferences the 650 is the better headphone. The two have been compared to death online, but if you have the capacity to think for yourself, audio review sites and forums are usually an unsavory if fascinating combination of shilling, self-justification, and "follow the leader" parroting of received opinions. Many self-proclaimed "audiophiles" have strong opinions about equipment they've never actually heard, which I can't accept.Given that, I decided the only way to compare the two headphones honestly was to listen to both myself for hours, going back and forth on a wide variety of recordings. The difference between a good recording and a bad recording dwarfs the difference between lossy and lossless, and the HD600 (more so than the HD650) may end up changing your taste in music because it makes good recordings sound SO GOOD and bad recordings sound SO BAD. In other words, it reveals the "truth" of the recording, and sometimes the truth hurts‚Äîit's really hard to enjoy The Killers now.The fact is that the 600 and 650 are ultimately more alike than different, and the popular insistence that they sound completely different has more to do with what Freud called "the narcissism of small differences" than the headphones themselves. If you Google some variation on "HD650 vs HD600," you'll hear over and over that the 650 is "bassier" or "darker." Not really. There's actually very little difference across this parameter. Piano music presents an exception, but this is rarely what people think of as a bassy genre.There are two significant differences. The first is soundstage. The HD650's soundstage is wider, but that doesn't mean it can make a cramped recording sound airy. The HD600's soundstage is more intimate; there's less space between left and right channels, but it's not a huge difference, and I could see people preferring (or at least not minding) the HD600's tighter spacing.The most striking difference between the two headphones is in what I'd call "smoothness." The best analogy I can think of comes from digital photography. As an image sensor increases its sensitivity, it also increases its noise because you can't amplify a signal without also amplifying noise. There are two rival philosophies for dealing with noise: leave it as "grain" or smooth it out. Grain has its devotees, and the advantage of grain is that it preserves fine detail. The disadvantage is that past a certain point it becomes a distraction. The advantage of smoothness, meanwhile, is that it looks superficially nicer. The disadvantage is that when you look closely you won't see all the fine details. Like all things, it's a continuum of compromise. The 600 is the headphone to get if you value detail at the cost of an occasionally unpleasant grainy and even metallic quality to the sound. The 650 is the one to get if you care more about music than sound and don't care if your headphones sand down the sharp edges of your music a bit.Going back and forth between the two, it quickly becomes clear that the 650 is the stronger all-around performer: it sounds nicer on more recordings and across more genres. The 600, meanwhile, is the champion of a particular niche: good recordings with lots of micro detail. Want to be able to count how many times the skin of a drum reverberates after it's struck? Want to hear such fine vocal gradations you'll know how a singer felt during recording? The 600 is for you.Make no mistake: at its best, the 600 produces the most astonishingly detailed sound I've ever heard. Unfortunately, at its worst it sounds grainy, jumbled, and not particularly musical. I'm sorry to report that piano music sounds particularly off on the 600: low frequencies disappear and take the fullness of the keys with them. Vocals can sound oddly recessed, even far away. In general, the 600 seems to fare better with female vocals than male ones, and with strings over pianos. It's absolutely glorious for acoustic guitar, but then, so is the 650.The 650's great advantage lies in its ability to bring out vocals like a spotlight. They stand out so clearly and powerfully from the instrumentation that you'll feel like you're hearing your favorite songs for the first time. The effect is really quite incredible: it's like there's a special sonic column reserved for vocals and unpolluted by other sounds. Based on Sennheiser's own specs, the 650 has lower distortion than the 600 and it's clearly a more refined driver unit. Whatever the technical reason, the 650's background is pitch black: sounds rise from and fall back into a sea of silence. Be forewarned: a well-recorded vocal track through the 650 may bring tears to your eyes, and that's why I kept the 650 and returned the 600.
Oh, one of the most beloved and well known headphones in the audiophile community. These were my 'dream' headphone since the beginning of my audiophile journey. One I never thought I'd ever buy back then. It's also one of the few headphones that after I learned what sonic quality I wanted in a headphone, didn't think I would personally like. If I had bought them months or years ago, I'm not sure I would've liked them. I tend to prefer a bright, aggressive, bass and treble-centric headphone. The HD650 is known to be the opposite. Dark/warm, relaxed, and smooth, with dulled treble response. You can see why I was very adamant about not ever giving these a chance.It wasn't until recently that I wanted to venture out and look for something a little different from my normal preferences. An alternative that I'd use whenever I wanted to sit back, and enjoy a soothing sound, with forward mids/vocals that I could watch my TV shows, movies, anime with. Ironically, my secondary can is considerably more expensive than my main can (DT990s) at the time. Lol, Head-fi logic. Well, I went and took the plunge, hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. I thought I would hate them. Really. It was an experiment that would cost me, but one I needed to do at some point, as the HD650 was always that ONE headphone I was always curious about (more than any other).So what happened? Did I like them? Hate them? To my surprise... I loved them for music, movies, TV, and anime, and liked but wasn't thrilled by them for gaming. Let's get into the sound.Bass: The lows. Well, this is surprising. They are actually pretty bassy. Not DT990 bassy, but they have a nice, full, bassy sound. I'd say it's between the DT880 and 990 in presence. It's a warm bass, with medium speed. Pretty much ideal for all-rounder headphones with good bass that would please those that like balance and a fun signature. The bass quantity is enjoyable for all crowds, unless you're a pure neutral-head or pure bass-head. I didn't find myself wanting more bass, though they do roll off in the sub-bass, which is typical of most dynamic headphones, something the HE-400 has no problems with.If I could score the bass, it'd be; Quantity: 7.5, Quality: 8. Just really pleasing bass all around.Mids: This is the star of the show. And when I say star... I mean, it is absolutely one of the best interpretation of mids/vocals I have EVER heard on any headphone...EVER. I'm usually fine with mid recession as I tend to prefer bass and treble emphasis, but MAN... once I heard the HD650... it made me see mids in a whole new light. The vocals are so sweet, so upfront, so rich, so haunting! Based on mids alone, I recommend this headphone to ANYONE looking for a headphone that does vocals some amazing justice. The only other headphone that provides really sweet mids that I've heard is the Audio Technica ESW9, but the ESW9 is a closed on ear, with a considerably smaller soundstage, and overly smooth treble, and stuffy sound signature in comparison. The ESW9 is good, but not HD650 good.The HD598 also has very forward mids, but I felt the lean bass, and thinner sound, made the mids sound unnaturally forward and shouty. The warmth and fullness of the HD650 basically destroyed any chance the HD598 had in a direct comparison. There was no competition. The HD650's mids demolish the HD598's in tone, realism, and richness. The HE400 is often compared to the HD650, and despite my preference for the HE400, the HD650 is clearly the king of mids here. The HE400 has great, INTEGRATED mids, that don't sound pushed back or forward with a realistic tone. That being said, the HD650's forward mids are special. The HD650 clearly wins here. As far as Q701 and HD650's mids, the HD650 wins again. The Q701 has forward mids, but they aren't nearly as full sounding, or as rich.Long story shot, the mids are godly. If I had to score them: Quantity: 10, Quality: 10. That is perfection, because that's how I feel about the HD650's mids.Treble: Oh the treble. This is single-handedly the ONLY reason I have put off getting the HD650 for so long. If you read about the HD650, the treble will always be discussed and debated on. Are they too smooth, rolled off, undetailed... veiled? This is a debate that will never end on Head-fi. As a fan of treble sparkle and some emphasis, I was absolutely mortified about hearing what people said of the HD650's smooth, laid back, dull, treble.So how did they sound to me? Surprisingly, I REALLY liked the treble! I didn't LOVE it. I still do prefer some more sparkle, but as the relaxing alternative to my typical treble emphasized headphones, I didn't find the treble overly smooth or dull on the HD650. Trust me, when your main can is the DT990 which is known for it's SUPER treble emphasis, and compare it directly to the much more reserved and rolled off treble of the HD650, you would tend to notice a huge difference. In all honestly, I really thought the treble on the HD650s was right where it should be for the type of headphone that the HD650 is. Without that treble, I think the HD650 wouldn't sound as rich and 'creamy' as they do. Would I use the HD650s as my ONLY headphone? To be frank, no. They performed well in absolutely everything except genres that desired an aggressive signature. Stuff like metal, and EDM just didn't have the energy on the HD650s. So no, they aren't the perfect all rounders. However, through some vocal dependent tracks, and stuff like movies, TV, and most non-music needs (even gaming), the HD650s are indeed in a very good place. Unfortunately, I tend to listen to EDM and metal more than anything, so the HD650 lost a few points.To score the treble; Quality: 7, Quantity: 7. If the treble is boosted by a bit, these could be what I'd consider very natural to neutral with a slight emphasis towards bass. I think they'd be less rich overall though, so I personally wouldn't want to touch what makes the HD650 what they are.Amping: I have the HD650 paired up with the Audio-GD SA-31 which is much more powerful than pretty much any amp most of you use, or would use, so I'm not exactly sure how they'd sound with less power, but I personally felt that they aren't as hard to drive as people make them out to be. They need considerably less power than the DT990/600, and possibly even the DT990/250. I'd say they'd need about as much as the DT990/32 for at LEAST volume level. We know power =/= volume, but it helps. To be clear: they do not need a lot to be driven LOUDLY. I tested them with the Mixamp only, and they can be driven off it loud enough. I didn't test it enough to see how well they're actually driven, but they sounded good. They may be a little thinner sounding, which could actually be a good thing for gaming, as it makes pinpointing sounds a bit easier than the very rich, thick signature the HD650s have with the SA-31.Okay, so how did they perform for gaming?---START GAMER SECTION---Soundstage: I haven't gotten to the specifics of gaming with the HD650s yet, but I'll mention the soundstage first. With and without extra amping the Mixamp, I felt the HD650's soundstage to be medium sized. Not big, and not little. However, I didn't find them to be stellar in terms of depth, so the sense of space for gaming, wasn't as good as I would have hoped. I was always expecting the HD650 to not be the greatest pairing for Dolby Headphone, and my fears were slightly warranted. The front/back depth isn't great. Let's get that out of the way. The width is good, but not close to being the best. The DT990 destroys the HD650 in both depth and width. So how's the air within the soundstage? Well, the problem with the HD650, is that it's a very full sounding headphone. Thick, warm tone tends to make the soundstage seems less airy and smaller. This is one of those times where a thinner/leaner sounding headphone has the advantage, like the AD700/HD598/K701. The HD650 isn't STUFFY like say the ESW9, but that rich tonality doesn't help gamers.Positioning: Positioning and soundstage tend to go hand in hand, so if the soundstage isn't great, the positional cues will suffer. How did the HD650 fare positional-wise? Well, they were good. Not great, and could obviously be better, but they do their job. I could play something like Black Ops without any problems, though having used headphones much better for soundstage/positioning, I could tell they lacked a bit. I'd put the HD650 just ever so slightly above the DT880 positional wise, but they aren't that much better.Clarity: You need clarity for soundwhoring in competitive gaming. Despite the laid back treble, I found the natural tone of the HD650 to be very detailed. The forward mids came off very clean and clear, and I felt I didn't miss any sounds. I've heard better overall (even the 990's are better for soundwhoring). The problem is that the HD650 is a very thick sounding headphone. Basically, the issues I explained in the soundstage section is what hurts clarity for gaming purposes.---END GAMER SECTION---Comfort: I mentioned that Sennheiser likes their clamp. The HD201, HD280 Pro (!), PC360, and HD598 all have some form of clamp. The HD650 is no different. They do clamp a bit more than I'd personally like, but it's a minor gripe overall. I find the HD650 to be very comfortable overall, and over extending the arms a little, to wear the HD650 slightly loose alleviates the clamp a bit. I've felt better, but not much better. The velours are great. Not too firm, and not too soft. The cups are huge and will fit ears very comfortably. I like the oval shape, which makes them easier to use while laying down compared to circular cups.Value: The Sennheiser HD650 is a considerably expensive headphone. If your main purpose for getting a headphone is gaming, there are considerably better options for less. If pure audio fidelity, and non-gaming purposes is your main purpose, the HD650 is incredibly hard to beat. Their sound signature is just stellar for most things, save for a few genres, and they're competent for gaming, just not stellar. I personally can't justify owning both the HD650 and HE-400, so I stuck with the HE-400 which is a more energetic, and better equipped for gaming use.Final Impressions: The HD650 has a very special place in my heart. It took years to finally take the plunge, but I'm VERY glad I did. They have quickly become one of my very favorite headphones. Though their gaming performance isn't as stellar as I would have hoped, it's better than I expected. I absolutely love the HD650 overall, and they have made me see the importance of mids, if even for just non-gaming, non-music use. Movies and TV shows are made for the HD650. Their incredible tonality, rich/full sound, perfect mids are an absolute blessing. Treble is definitely it's weakest aspect of sound, but they aren't veiled, just...reserved.For gamers looking for all-rounders, these do put up a fight. They're better than the vast majority of headphones I mentioned on this guide in terms of audio fidelity, but in raw performance for gaming, they're outclassed by others costing considerably less.
I own around 8-10 different headphones and earphones that range in brands, price, styles, etc...  I‚Äôve tried Klipsch, Bose, Sennheiser, V-Moda, Audio Technica, Beats, Apple, AKG, Samsung, Sony, Skullcandy, etc...  I do enjoy listening to a large variety of music and I do like premium headphones but I am in no way an audiophile. The brand I always seem to go back to for more has always been Sennheiser.  It all started with the HD558 open back headphones. It was my first experience with open back headphones and I really liked it. I found myself hearing so much more than I had ever heard in my favorite music.  Now after using the HD650 for a while I feel I can offer a decent impression for someone considering purchasing these headphones.While many people will surely disagree(audiophiles I‚Äôm looking at you), you can technically drive these headphones with your phone or mobile music device.  It does have 300ohm impedance, but the sensitivity of the drivers is such that you can get enough volume to ‚Äúhear‚Äù music. It is almost loud enough and I imagine for many people it will be enough. However, the HD650 may as well be a cheaper pair of headphones if all you‚Äôre going to do is plug these into your phones because the listening experience takes off when these cans are driven properly.  Whereas you can hear music through them on your phone you can actually listen to music when you have these driven.My setup is fairly simple and somewhat low end still. In fact I imagine that I haven‚Äôt had a chance to fully appreciate my headphones yet. I am using the Schiit Fulla 2 DAC/Amp and plugging in my iPhone 7 Plus with the camera adapter through usb into the Fulla 2 and have listened to lower quality music files, Apple Music 256kbps, and Tidal lossless 1.4Mbps files.  While there are a lot of entry level DAC/Amp or Amp solutions I think the Fulla 2 is excellent in its quality, power, ease of use, and options.The build quality is good and while it does use a lot of plastic it feels durable. What I really appreciate about Sennheiser and specifically these headphones is that while everything feels durable it is also all replaceable. You can replace the headband, the head cushion, the ear pads, the cable, and you can order it all from Sennheiser directly.  I like owning a product that I know I can maintain and I appreciate not having to send it to Sennheiser to fix every little thing.  I have owned a lot of headphones that use cheap plastic that cracks, pleather that flakes and peels, and rubber coatings that wear and get sticky. Then you call the companies and they either don‚Äôt make the parts at all or used to but don‚Äôt anymore because they don‚Äôt make the product any longer.  The design of the HD650 has been used from at least the HD600 and longer than most millennials have been alive. In fact they kept the tried an true design for their new HD660s so they‚Äôll have parts for years to come.Speaking of tried and true, they are that way because for one the design has worked acoustically for them but also the design has led to one of the most comfortable headphones ever made. They can take an adjustment period and for people with big heads like myself, I recommend fully extending the earpieces and flexing the metal band the relax the clamp force on your head. There are instructions online for how to do this safely or you could always stretch them out over a box to loosen them up a bit.  If the clamp is too strong or not either way you‚Äôll end up with a very nice and comfortable fit.  The ear pads are a nice velour material and the foam is appropriately soft and spongy. The head cushion is a very silky material and the foam is very soft.  I really like that it has a small gap right at the top of your head to prevent that from being a hot spot of discomfort right on all of the blood flow in that area.  After working my set in I find them easily wearable for hours and hours without discomfort although the ear pads can get a little warm if you‚Äôre in a hot area.  After putting them on your head I recommend just tweaking the rotation of the ear cups until they feel right.In my experience with these headphones I have been very impressed.  In fact it may be the most enjoyable music listening experience I‚Äôve ever had. The HD650 is described as the most colorful in the HD6 line but compared to most of the headphones I have used before, it comes off as pretty neutral and well balanced. The mids are a bit forward compared to the lows and highs but it feels natural to my ears. It is a warmer, darker, slower, and thicker experience but it‚Äôs smooth and rich. I know it sounds like I‚Äôm describing eating dark chocolate but it is a bit like Dark chocolate for your ears.  The level of detail is great and it is just very easy on the ears. I enjoy listening to music on my HD650‚Äôs and I actually do so more than anything else so far.  If you‚Äôre looking for bass, I‚Äôd keep looking. These are open back headphones and while the bass is very nice and well defined they are not gonna punch you in the face like a bass head would like.Comparing them to my HD700‚Äôs I would recommend getting these because while the HD700 is maybe technically a better headphone it is sometimes too analytical and the spikes in the high end can make listening to them a little tiring. If you just wanted to listen to classical music then the HD700‚Äôs are amazing and better than the HD650 in my opinion but overall the HD650‚Äôs feel more versatile and more enjoyable for all types of music.If I had to make any complaints about the HD650 it would have to be the wire connections and the stiffness of the adjustment on the ear cups. The headphones were nice enough to put the Braille letter L on the left side but the cable has no such thing.  The connection point is a two prong termination that has to go a specific way on a specific side. They do have a small raised L and R respectively on each side and the raised letters are meant to face outward. The problem is seeing and feeling the raised letters to tell which is which. If you‚Äôre in good light and have decent vision then it is easy enough to see. However if lighting isn‚Äôt great and/or your vision isn‚Äôt perfect you‚Äôll have a hard time telling which is which. To make matters worse you can potentially damage the cable termination or the headphones if you plug them in incorrectly.  The three bump Braille ‚ÄúL‚Äù on the left side would have been an easy solution to this, especially considering they‚Äôve already used it on the ear cups.Another issue is the stiffness of the adjustment band. Sizing these headphones perfectly is required for maximum comfort. You ideally want both sides to be more or less equal lengths and to the right position so the headband isn‚Äôt putting too much pressure on your head and the ear cups sit well over your ears.  Trying to adjust the headband is a bit of an inconvenience because to start with it is stiff and hard to pull out one click at a time. The best way to do this is to grab the metal portion towards the ear cup and pull away from the headband. Also there are no markers indicating the adjustment so you can‚Äôt be quite sure if both sides are equal or in the right spot until you put them on and then resize them.  Another minor gripe but something that seems easy to address.I feel the HD650 is around or just past entry level audiophile headphones.  If you‚Äôre looking to upgrade to these from something like a HD558 or 598 I would say go to an audio store that can provide you with a burned in set of headphones with good quality DAC/Amp and the listen to the kind of music you like. Considering these really only come alive with the right equipment driving them I think testing these out beforehand is the only way to go.  Also, if you really do like these headphones the HD6XX from Massdrop have come around 3 times or so for $200. They are basically the HD650 rebranded and selling for $200 and I think that‚Äôs a steal.The HD650‚Äôs might change the way you feel about music. They might allow you to explore songs you‚Äôve heard hundreds of times but in ways you never knew.  They also may not do any of that for you, but if you appreciate music I think you just might appreciate these too.
HD 650Heavenly sonic bliss. My favorite headphone. Full rich, lush sounding voices and instruments. Widest sound stage of my headsets with excellent clarity. Very easy to separate and follow various voices and instruments in the music I listen to. Very balanced across the entire range of frequencies without one range over powering another. Everything is very clear. No muddiness of sound. Cybals and chimes crisp and clear. Snare drums nice crisp sound. Bass pleasant with excellent sound decay and appropriate reverberation lasting longer than my other headsets. I can really feel the music around my ears with this headset. The sound envelopes my head instead of feeling like its between my ears. Now I can experience the music rather than just listen to it. Makes music much more enjoyable and realistic sounding. This can be driven by my iPod, iPad, MacBook Pro, Laptops and Desktop PCs without an amplifier. I have no doubt an amplifier will improve the sound, but the sound is already rich and clear without amplification and still better than my other headphones. I'm hearing/experiencing things that I never heard before with my other headsets ... the faint pops that occur from an old LP that has been digitally recorded ... just amazing (from an iPod without amplifier).This is my experience. Your mileage may vary depending upon what you want out of your headsets.Finding the ‚Äúbest headphone" is a very expensive and very subjective journey. Reading reviews can only take one so far. Opinions range far and wide depending upon the reviewers individual tastes, experience with music and what one primarily listens to. Descriptions of the sound in reviews don't always help due to differences in meaning. For example what is described as the veiled Sennheiser sound may be what I call a mellow laid back sound (not sure). My advise is listen to your music with a lot of different headphones and do your own comparisons to determine what you like. What you hear coming from each headphone is going to vary with the design of the headphone, but also modulated bya. the type of music you listen tob. how the recording was originally made (microphones converting analog to electrical then stored on magnetic tape or digitized)b. the quality of the recording you are listening to (especially if digitized, what was truncated if anything)c. the format in which it is recorded and sampling rated. the equipment you play it on and how it translates the recording back to an electrical impulse to be sent to the headphonee. the headphones themselves (open, closed, type of diaphragm material, how many speakers (i.e. the Shure 500 series has 2 woofers and a tweeter in each ear piece to achieve its balanced sound presentation across its spectrum, I have a gaming headset with multiple speakers)Having said that, the music I listen to is classical to 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, pop, country, jazz, big bands, vocals, instrumentals.I don‚Äôt have a dedicated amplifier and play all my headphones on iPods, iPads, iPhones, Mac Book Pros, PCs, Pioneer Tuners. All my headphones sound just fine without an amplifier, but I have no doubt that an amplifier will improve the sound.My music is recorded in MP3 at 320 kbps, but I prefer M4A apple lossless or WAV at 1400 kbps for the best possible digital sound quality. I can hear the difference between 1400 kbps,  320 kbps, and the more compressed music at 192 and 128 which can be found on MP3 sites like the apple store. I convert my CD collection to both 1400 kbps and 320 kbps 44.1 MHz so it can be played at the best quality on whatever system I am using.All my headphones have been broken in with at least a 72 hour continuous play run.My headphones from most favorite to least favorite areSennheiser HD 650Shure 500PTHSennheiser HD 598AKG K550Sennheiser HD 555 modified to 595Sony DLP777  ‚Äî brightJaybird Spirit ‚Äî midtones muffled due covering that prevents sweat getting into ear piecesSennheiser HD 280Noise cancellers:Bose QC2  ‚Äî bass heavy, muddy midtonesBose QC3  ‚Äî even more bass have, muddy midtonesDr. Dre Beats  ‚Äî too bass heavy, stick to rap and non-critical listening (rap)For me, the HD 650 is a 5 star headphone and by far my favorite of all my headphones. Allows me to truly feel and experience the music I like listening to using the devices I have. My iPods, iPhone, iPads and MacBook Pro can drive this 300 ohm just fine (of course the volume level has to be turned up compared to the lower ohm headphones), but the lush rich realistic sound still comes through better than the other headphones.By feel, I mean that the HD650 diaphragms move so much air around my ears I can feel and experience the music as opposed to just hearing it. The Shure PTH500 can do this in my ear canal. My HD598 does this much better than the HD 555 and has a more pleasant sound to me than the HD555. But none of these come close to the experience I get with my new HD650. It‚Äôs like standing in front of a speaker at a concert or DJ‚Äôd party except its around me ears instead of having my body feel the sound wave.The timbre, tone, character of the instruments from the HD650 is slightly better than my original reference PTH500. PTH500 and HD650 are better than my other headsets. With these two, I discovered things that I couldn‚Äôt hear with the other headsets. Sound stage of the HD650 is wider than the PTH500 which is wider than the other headphones. Both have much better separation of the  instruments and vocals and much better clarity which gives the music a more 3 dimensional enjoyable sound. Much easier to pick out individual instruments and so I can more easily play along on piano, guitar etc. With other headsets I have to struggle to hear the individual parts. The Shure 500 has been my favorite reference headphone since 2008. With its sound isolation qualities, I use it when traveling and when I don't want to disturb others around me. The problem with it is that it can eventually be painful on the ear canals and sound quality (bass) is lost when the ear canal seal is lost when moving around or exercising. Additionally, hearing the crunch of food while eating and listening with the 500s is a consequence of in ear monitors.Both the HD650 and PTH500 have the best balance across all sound frequencies with the widest sound stage. The Bose QC2, QC3, and Beats have more emphasis on bass followed by treble at the expense of midtones, so if I want really loud bass, I‚Äôll go with the Beats followed by QC3, then QC2 for lesser degrees of bass punch.The HD 598 was my favorite after the PTH500 because its open design moves a lot of air allowing me to kind of feel the music, but not the extent of the HD650. It has what I consider a more laid back and mellow sound than the HD 555 and PTH500. Kinda relaxing and pleasant.HD555 DLP777 place more emphasis on treble. If I want high energy treble, the HD555 and AKG K550 are my go to headsets.I prefer the open design over the closed headsets because they just move air better with a generally richer sound then my closed headphoneShure 500PTH ‚Äî best overall balance and 3D clarity while physically blocking outside noiseHD 598 -- open, good overall balance, mellow soundAKG 550 ‚Äî closed, good overall balance. doesn't move air as well as HD598, but good second choice to the 598HD 280 ‚Äî closed thin; waste of my money. was never happy with it.Sony MDP 777 ‚Äî closed, emphasis on trebleBose QC2 ‚Äî closed moderate bass. muddy midtonesBose QC3 ‚Äî closed heaviest on bass. muddy midtoneSo my choices for headsets boil down toBest overall sonic experience: HD650Best outside noise reduction/isolation and overall sonic experience: Shure 500 seriesBest to minimize noise spill into the surrounding environment when I can‚Äôt use the Shure 500: AKG 550Best for heavy bass emphasis: In order from least bass to intense bass: Bose QC2, QC3, Dr. Dre BeatsUltimately the ‚Äúbest‚Äù headset is a subjective opinion depending upon what you want to hear and/or experience out of your music. There is a huge sliding scale of perceived quality. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend spending much on an expensive headset if your music is 128 kbps compressed. But then again, it is cheaper to just buy 1 headset and grow into it rather than spend lots of money working ones way up to the holy grail of headsets. If I knew then what I know now, I would have just bought the HD650 and stopped there.
I‚Äôve been using Audio Technica AT50‚Äôs since 2004 and MSR7‚Äôs for about 3 years. The 50‚Äôs are great for bass heavy music and the MSR7‚Äôs are (I thought) great for detailed acoustic, vocal, percussion and other 1khz and higher audio.I don‚Äôt know what my expectations were with the Sennheiser HD650‚Äôs. All I knew for sure is that I have read countless reviews and articles where they are used as reference headphones. Whether as the focus of the written material, or in passing as the gear reviewers use when auditing or reviewing other equipment and music/media. The HD650‚Äôs are universally accepted as a reference headphone.So over the last several years they have sparked my curiosity.I ordered them and received them within 2 days. I am a classic rock aficionado, and have my own set of reference tracks that I use when trying out new equipment in my home studio. I‚Äôve played guitar and drums for 35 years (not expertly, but passable?). I have a nice Roland Kit, a couple of nice Fender and Mesa Boogie Tube Amps, Fractal Axe FX III guitar processor and run it all through various digital I/O and microphones into an RME UFX+ Audio Interface.The RME interface has an excellent ADC/DAC configuration, with a very clean sound at the headphone jack that matches the outputs on the other analog outputs on the interface, but is also amplified. They didn‚Äôt cut corners.All of this is to say that I have great reference hardware, knowledge of good source media, and the headphone amplifier and DAC section from my audio interface surpasses most high end audio AVR‚Äôs.Now generally, like most folks these days, I listen to rather low end compressed MP3 audio. It‚Äôs readily available and doesn‚Äôt take up storage space.As storage space has become less expensive, I‚Äôve started to record and save my audio in the highest quality format my interface will allow. Generally that is a minimum of 16bit 320kbps compressed, or as high as 24bit 96khz, with maximum playback capability of 24 bit/192kHz. All the detail. The things that you didn't even know were buried in the mix. The 3 second harmonies, the double tracks that are barely distinguishable, the finite exquisite breath of the vocalist as they prepare for the next line of the verse. All laid out in stunning depth and form. Strange things that you didn‚Äôt even know were in the mix, that add depth and character to the music, that are underneath the main harmony and melody of the music. Things that only an explorative and creative genius of a producer would include in the mix and final mastering. Dark Side of the Moon takes on a new landscape. Steely Dan Aja highlights perfection of studio recording at it's finest. You can get lost for hours in old recordings and hear the things that you didn't even know made the music that you enjoy so enjoyable.Edit: As an aside, I need to include something extra ordinary. Something that I would presume that maybe 1/10th of 1% of folks who actually purchased these headphones would pursue. An opportunity to audit the HD650‚Äôs via an RME ADI-2 PRO FS BE AD/DA.The RME unit is in the Top 3, or arguably is the best, mastering quality DAC and by far the best headphone amp that money can buy. Period. No exceptions. Numbers don‚Äôt lie and RME‚Äôs audio engineering team is among the finest on the planet and can back them up. The UFX+, as I mentioned, is no slouch at all. They perform tremendously in the studio, and the quality of the gear DOES shine through during headphone testing. Blissful.But‚Ä¶.When you listen to anything through the ADI-2, it‚Äôs clich√©d to say, but it really is not just ‚Äúnext level‚Äù. It‚Äôs the very ‚Äútop level‚Äù.That said. You have now reached a level of clarity that some people might actually find slightly uncomfortable believe it or not. The lack of distortion is unfamiliar and with poorly recorded or or media compressed with a bad encoder, the flaws shine. Too much so occasionally.On the other hand. With good to exceptional media, and phones like the HD650 that can convey expertly produced media, you will be sitting at the control desk, where the mastering engineer was sitting. Hearing everything (and maybe more) than they were hearing as they put the final touches on the song or album. I have yet to audition what are considered to be be ‚Äúbetter‚Äù headphones. Maybe someday I‚Äôll get a chance to A/B the HD650‚Äôs against another premium set. Until then I remain blown away by the Sennheisers.  If you‚Äôre here trying to decide if you should pull the trigger on these. It is simply a resounding YES!Keep in mind that these are 300 Ohm headphones. They will require more power than your iPhone, or Android phone to fully appreciate their capabilities. You do not need a $1000 headphone amp to enjoy them. Their are several headphone amps/Pro level DAC‚Äôs from $200 to several thousand dollars that will all do the job. I highly recommend that you are able to drive them with an output of greater than 100mW minimum. Just my opinion. Do what you will. But you will not be able drive any kind of realistic bass below that threshold. Yes, people around you will hear them. But you are buying open back headphones for a reason. Your listening enjoyment. Find a place to disappear and enjoy them and turn it up.I highly recommend these headphones. They are simply incredible.
All my life I hate headphones, because I couldn't listen to them longer period of times in ear canal ones were piercing my brain over on ear ones were uncomfortable with side effects my ears were sweating itching. Experience made me refuse buy any headphones over the decade because I've always felt they not worth it. Other hands I have quite old vintage Pioneer Hi-Fi Speakers which is my uncle bought in 80's. They still sounds great but only goes to  frequency response 28 KHZ max. I have approximately 105 SACD ripped them to DSD ( Sony DSF) format with my old PS3, sacd ripper, Also Around 203 Hi-Res albums ( 24 BIT) which my friends & I bought shared through different online stores like ( Hdtracks, Qobuz, Hiresaudio.com etc). Rest of my collection just Redbook 16 bit 44.1 khz lossless format ), I haven't decent DSD native decoding DAC I'm using Macbook Pro 15.  ( 2016) this device Audio capabilities garbage it has Cirrus Logic DAC muddy which only goes 96 khz, line out from this device only limited 48 khz max feeding this device through line out to amp to speakers were awful experience everything sounds muddy instruments sound separation, soundstage nothing is presents Hi-Res Audio sounded worth than CD etc. I have before Sony SACD player it laser head malfunctioned after 8 years of Use & went bad 8 years ago. After this thing broken from different laptops even expensive Apple Macbook Pro audio experience was worst I've experienced so far. I knew I need some sort of USB Audio Advanced DAC something to convert my DSD files Natively & Hi-Res Audio max out of resolution doesn't make sense have 24 bit 192 khz lossless file when your device DAC only can reproduce 96 khz can only output 48 khz max so you got my point. I have proper DAC now which Capable Play DSD ( 64,128) natively  PCM up to 384 khz & line out headphone out not limited to 48 khz anymore it is alo headphone amp which have specs 285 mv ( 32 Ohm) 2.9 volt.1. Sennheiser HD 650 Comfort  ----------- I would give 10/10 never used anything like this before, you can listen for longer periods without getting any fatigue  or discomfort they also very well breathable, I'm using this about 5-6 hours without break I've never got tired this is so big advantage this headphones have over others & what make them so special best in their class ( Note they have little clamping force in beginning when they are new but this thing easily resolved after 4 days of Use I left them on position Clamping Box 10 cm distance from each drives 4 days all day & this clamping pressure has gone)2. Sennheiser HD 650 Sound Quality & Resolution ----------- Second batch of this product which is currently Amazon.com selling have frequency response up to 10 - 41.000 hz ( Hi - Res Audio Certified By Japan Audio Society) it has sticker on box, Sound quality resolution everything crystal clear bass in there ( Mids Vocals I've never heard anything like this they are magical & very straight forward & intimidate this headphones only woth buying just for listening female vocals they sounds so precious nothing come close this kind of quality this cans providing in this regard), Highs many others would say veiled actually I'm not agree with that they very well represented they just not piercing this is one of the magic formula which makes listen to this headphones long listen sessions  without getting tired.3. Sennheiser HD 650 -Power Requirement DAC, Amplification, Source ------------- This headphones rated 300 ohm, Power requirement for this I'm not 100 % sure but checked online headfi.org other online 3 volt 500 mv - 32 ohm, everyone says they incredible scales with powerful amp. I'm currently using them with my 2.9 volt 285 mv on 30 ohm source they driving this in required level so they sounds incredible, I've not t feeding them all 500 mv by now I don't own so powerful headphone amp yet. I bet with powerful amp they even getting better. Of Course Source material DAC also matters it will help get better results in the end. Currently my source 1200 ( 16 bit 44.1 khz albums lossless format), 105 DSD SACDS, 203 Hi-Res 24 Bit ( 44.1 khz up to 192 khz files) 150 albums I have in ITunes format 256 kb/s ACC, In my listening best sounding is DSD, 2nd place 192 khz PCM, 3 rd place Redbook CD 16/44.1, worst sounding AAC 256 kb/s . During listening sessions I'm more often trying avoid this ACC albums. So source matters as well to get full more detailed refined experience.4. Sennheiser HD 650 - value build quality --------------- This headphones lightweight for it own class so you couldn't expect this thing being build from any metal it have metal where durability matter Driver Grills made from metal headband clamping sides made from metal, rest of the Unit it is high quality plastic. If you take a good care about your equipment I didn't think it will be broken anytime soon some people using HD 600 now over 15 years & nothing got broken during this time except pads & cable this is normal. This thing Made In Europe Ireland how many items do you own last 2 decades made in Europe ? Trust me build quality it is top notch. For 374.99 $ this headphones is steal. This is 500 $ valued headphones for the resolution comfort this thing provide I don't think they overpriced, nowadays any sub par Sony or Other HI-RES headphones costing 250 $ forget about bluetooth other futures every other headphone have sound quality  through wireless option worst indeed,  still best option connection for optimal sound quality is wire.Audio Software Used for testing Audio Nirvana Plus full version only available by this moment only ON MAC OS costing 74.99 $, It is bitperfect software have Lots of Audio futures & excellent sound quality 10 times better what average ITUNES sounds like, Native DSD playback, advanced metadata editing etc.I'm usually not to keen write reviews about products but I then saw some people giving this item sub par scoring one star rating so I decide wrote one. Please don't listen to this people they don't using this headphone as intended. They generally bought it plugged into smartphone jack or laptop, in my experience this headphone I'm not tried my smartphone but from Macbook Pro 15 ( 2016) headphone jack they sound like some cheap 15 $ no name headphone. So Please note ( Source, DAC, proper amp, all this matters to get full out of this headphones)
These headphones are slightly colored.  Most people prefer that, but if you're using them for studio monitors, you won't find better than the HD800's.  Trust me.  But for everyday use, these can't be beat for dynamic open headphones.  Combine them with a full tube amp and I highly doubt you'll find a better "stuck on an island the rest of your life" headphones.UPDATE:  After having owned these for over a year now, let me elaborate on my thoughts on these INCREDIBLE headphones.Value:  This is tough.  If you like open headphones, and love lower model Sennheisers, like the HD595, HD598, HD600, etc, then you'll surely LOVE these.  I owned a pair of HD595's for several years before I accidentally broken them due to the stupid long cable.  These sound very similar to those, only with a slightly darker top end, and much much much better bass.  And, they're just better overall, in soundstage, speed, bass depth, bass extension, resolution, etc.  Some people just don't like the open headphone sound.  That's perfectly fine, and if that's the case, you probably won't like these.  But if you've owned open headphones and like the open airy spacious natural sound... then you'll ADORE these.Comfort:  4.5 stars.  They're Sennheisers.  Pretty much all Sennheisers are extremely comfortable.  They're light.  The pads are usually comfortable soft velour.  They usually have medium light to light clamping force.  They have really large oval cups that fit the largest of ears.  If comfort is high on your list, these might fit your bill.Value: 5 stars.  These headphones bat outside their league.  Outside their price range.  I've seem MANY people go from these headphones to new headphones in the 4 digit range, then go back to these.  LOTS OF TIMES.  It's for a good reason.  These headphones are going to be a future classic.  You can quote me on that.  If you've never owned "audiophile" quality headphones before, this price might seem high, but trust me, to upgrade from these, you usually have to buy Planar Magnetic headphones like the Audeze LCD-2, LCD-3, LCD-X headphones or similar.  Those are all $1500+.  If you've never had good quality headphones, these might not be your best first choice.  Not because they don't sound good.  These sound incredible.  It's because these headphones are 300 ohms and require a pretty decent amp.  They scale well with good hardware upstream, so a good DAC helps a lot too.  (and source audio, you'll want 320 KB/s mp3's and FLAC if possible)Soundstage: 5 stars.  Do these have the best soundstage ever?  No.  HD800's have that title.  Why do I give it 5 stars then?  Because these headphones have a better soundstage than 98% of the headphones out there.Resolution:  4.5 stars.  Great, but not to the level of Planar/Ortho headphones.  If you've never heard $1500+ ortho headphones, you won't even know what I'm talking about anyways.Treble: 4.5 stars.  I'd give it 5 stars, but the treble on these headphones are rolled a tiny bit.  You may hear them described as "dark" or "veiled".  That's relative.  To me, I prefer darker headphones anyways.  Bright headphones are fatiguing and give me a headache after a few minutes.  These roll the highs just enough to make them easy to listen to for hours, yet leave enough treble there to leave the top end nice and sharp.  No sparkle.  Sparkle bad.  (depends on who you ask lol)Mids:  5 stars.  Sennheisers' bread and butter.  These have incredible mids.  Through tube amps, or hybrid tube amps, the mids are lush.  Liquidy.  Warm.  Female vocals will give you the chills.  The warmth of the mids on these cans will make you smile in aural ecstacy.Bass:  4.5 stars.  These headphones are probably the only headphones from Sennheiser with really good bass.  The bass isn't as tight or deep as on Ortho headphones, but for open cans, it's incredibly impressive.  I give the bottom end a tiny tiny bit of EQ to boost the bass, but other than that, it's the best bass I've heard from open headphones yet.  The punch is pretty solid.  I'd rate punch 3.5 stars.  Bass extension is really good.  I'd rate it 4 stars.  Overall though, I give it 4.5 stars considering these are open headphones.Scalability:  5 stars.  These cans scale like crazy.  Upgrade your DAC: you'll heard the difference.  Upgrade your amp: you'll hear a difference.  Upgrade your tubes: you'll hear a difference.  These headphones just keep giving.I used to own HD595's.  They blew my mind.  The bass on those sucked.  Worse than Bose Tri-Ports, which were aweful themselves in bass.  But you know what?  I loved the lush mids so much, as well as the airy soundstage, I didn't care about the lack of bass.  Those headphones broke later (my fault, not theirs), and I was forced to upgrade.  These headphones are an improvement in every way.  (other than weight and clamping force, the HD595 was lighter in weight and clamped lighter, but not by a whole lot)What's the best amp to drive these?  EASY.  Bottlehead Crack with Speedball upgrade.  They're hands down the best amp for these headphones.  Ask around.  You'll get the same answer.  Any full tube amp will do.  Even the hybrids sound good, but for some reason, these headphones come alive with a full tube amp like the Crack.DAC?  Any external DAC will suffice.  The $99 one from Schiit is fine.  Bifrost Uber even better if you can afford it.  O2.  Lots of choices.  Just don't drive these from the on-board audio on your motherboard.  That's just wrong.The best part about these headphones?  The headphones two to three times its price are only a marginal 10-20% better, if that.  And those usually require another 4 digits worth of gear to be worth getting.  These headphones are at that bang for buck price point where you really start to get diminishing returns when you try to upgrade from these.Pros:  Lots.  Value.  Soundstage.  Lush mids.  Soft highs for long listening session with no fatigue.  Awesome bass, in headphones that have open airy sound.  Removable cable.  Scalability.Cons:  ONLY con: You will have one HELL of a time finding headphones to upgrade to from these headphones.  Be warned!  These are so awesome for their price that you'll have a really hard time finding headphones you'll like better.  That's not really a con though, but since I can't think of any cons, I'll list it as one anyways!If you've heard other open headphones and like the huge soundstage and open sound, and want to upgrade: GET THESE.  Don't even hesitate.  You'll be blown away.  Just make sure you have good source files (320 mp3's or FLAC) and a full tube amp like the Bottlehead Crack amp.  Thank me later!  Enjoy!
If you are even a little bit interested in the world of headphones, you would have heard of Sennheiser HD600 and its evolved sister HD650. They are legendary headphones that even the most hardcore audiophiles won't knock. Situated at a price range of $300-400, they are expensive at first glance, but are actually middle of the road in terms of price. Sennheiser HD800, for example, retails for over $1600. However, as with anything to do with technology, there are diminishing returns in terms of how much more improvements in audio you would get out of the price you pay. For me and for a lot of others, at least right now, HD650 is that sweetspot.I graduated from a combo of FiiO E10K plus ATH-M50. Trust me when I say that my first time listening to the M50s, which are what I would call "actually decent" compared to what I've been listening before, my mind was blown away. Music was no longer a blur of sound, and I could hear individual instruments and nuances in vocals that I've never heard before. For $200, that combo was potent, and I feel like a lot of people who are reading this right now are coming from something similar: a beginner audiophile's kit. Why upgrade, you would ask? The thing is, if money is an issue, something like the M50s are plenty good enough. Nevertheless, would I say the $350+ upgrade is worth it? Absolutely.Keep in mind that these headphones are around $350, but they are also actually not. If you want to get the most out of them, you would need something like a $200 set of DAC/AMP at least. If you plug it in directly into your computer or iPhone, I doubt you would hear much. The 300 Ohms impedance on the HD650s means that you need a LOT of voltage to run them well. At first, I used the HD650s with the FiiO E10K, and even using that I was immediately struck by how much clearer and smoother everything was. You could heard the twang of the baselines, the smacking of lips before the vocals start, and the stick on membrane impact of the bass drums. I loved it, but was also a bit disappointed. People say that the HD600 had weak bass, while the HD650 improved on that. I didn't hear much bass at all; all the nuances were there, but there was no punch, no kick to it. The frequency range also felt off; some sounds would be ear piercingly loud while others dull. I then wondered if the E10K wasn't good enough, and decided to upgrade to a set of Schiit Magni/Modi. That upgrade made a world of difference. The bass punch was back, and the clarity was still there, but what's amazing was that the soundstage opened up. Almost every old track I listened to sounded entirely different. "Was that guitar always on the right side? Did that fade sound so far away? Was that bass so close to my ear before?" I was listening to music being performed, not being recorded.So, to break it down. The HD650s require a decent set of DAC/AMPs to sound good. That is good and bad. Bad that you have to spend more money, but good in that there's so much more room to improve. They are open back, which means that noise gets in and gets out. They are not good for listening in the public. However, the clarity is amazing, the soundstage is mind-bending, and unless you have $2000 to spend, it's hard to improve upon this further. At this price point and beyond, people are generally looking for "sound signatures" that they like instead of objective improvements.Talking about sound signatures, Sennheiser is famous for having flat frequency response curves and sound that are "analytical." What this means is that the HD650s do not generally emphasize any frequency on the sound spectrum. The bass won't rattle your head, and the trebles won't pierce your eardrums (although I think the HD600 and HD650s do cut off a bit on the treble side). What this also means is that they are great at presenting exactly what was recorded to you, which results in some not-so-well recorded/mastered songs sounding disappointing after you've had these. I personally don't find this problematic. However, one thing is for sure, and that is after listening to the improvements made possible by the HD650s, you would be hooked. Perhaps you find the sound signature too "cold," and want to add some variety with expensive tube amps. Perhaps you want to sample other manufacturers' cans within the same price range for differences. Or perhaps you would go crazy and eye those $1600 HD800s. That is the real tragedy of getting the HD650s.
LOVE these headphones! Super comfortable. Easy to wear for hours on end. Sound quality is remarkable. Balanced sound curve, not too heavy likes Beats (yuck) but don't have noise cancelling like Bose. These are are for enjoying music of all types. These are wired - not wireless, which I prefer since there is no static or hiss. The cable is a good length and very robust. 1/4" phone plug. Worth every penny. They are wonderful. Highly recommended.
https://www.amazon.com/Koss-R-80-Over-Headphones-Black/product-reviews/B00005N9D2/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews
This Koss Model R80 almost slipped by me for a number of reasons, but I won't go into that now.  Suffice it to say that over the past 6 months or so I began the process of testing and blogging about various very inexpensive headphones - and folks, there are tons of them out there - many of which can give the big expensive boys a run for their money.  So why not check them out?  Well, I did.During that same time-frame, I ran the gamut of testing headphones ranging from the absolutely cheaply priced KSC-75's and KPH-30 models along with a variety of other headphones priced from the $100 to $200 range such as the 1MORE Triple Driver Over-Ear Headphones (and many more).Alright, when I saw this Koss R80 headphone, I wondered why I hadn't seen it before (or heard about it).  There weren't any reviews on You Tube that I could find, and nothing much could be found about it.  Sure, if you look under the reviews for the R80 on Amazon, you see what appears to be thousands of them - but that's a huge mistake because Amazon just bunched all the reviews for a variety of Koss headphone models with the R80.  So if you begin reading, you will most likely be reading reviews about other models - and not the R80.After ordering the R80's, they arrived very quickly - within two days.  They do not come packaged in a box - rather, a cellophane plastic see-through bag - that's all.  The 3.5 MM cable is permanently attached to the R80's - no surprise there because Koss does this with all of their less expensive headphone models (and some more expensive models also).Let's first discuss the fit and comfort of the R80.  This may become very disappointing to some.  First of all, everything is plastic and there will be no bending of headbands or anything else on the R80's.  In fact, if you try, you may snap them in half.  The fit is fairly tight and the way the ear cups are angled, they do not necessarily lie flat against the head.  The top part of the ear pads touch the head, whereas the bottom part does not touch - strange indeed (or my friekin' head is strange - whatever).When I opened the bag, as is usually the case with Koss inexpensive headphones, the R80's were exceptionally light and very cheap feeling.  In fact, although they are what I would consider to be full sized headphones (over the ear), they just felt...well, "cheaper than usual," with a very, very light plastic.  The headband portion seemed better constructed than the rest of the headphones.But what about the sound, you ask?  Here's the kicker - they do "not" sound even halfway as good as the KS30's or 75's and you have to ask yourself why?  I mean to say that the R80 costs $40 (on Amazon), and with it being closed back, one would assume these would sound as good (or better) than the far less expensive Koss models mentioned above.  But it's not the case here at all.  Yes, the sound is open - especially for a closed back design - but that sound is muffled a bit by a slight veil, and at times hollow sounding (this one is difficult to explain).  In general, does it sound "good overall?"  Yes it does, but when using the term "good" when describing audio qualities, it is not the same as describing "accurate" or "realistic" when delineating the same.  The R80 just does not have the dynamic punch, overall sound-staging, and depth that the less expensive KSC-30's or KSC-75's have (not by a long shot).  But again, if "good" is all you're looking for, then these won't hurt the budget.  But then again, if that's the case, invest in the far less expensive Koss models mentioned above.It should also be noted that I even gave the R80's a burn-in time of 72 hours, running various test tones and music through them - all to no avail.  The sound did not improve.So if you are considering these, they do sound "good" overall.  They are fairly reasonable and do a fairly good job.  But they just won't excite like some of Koss's lesser (meaning, less expensive) options - now go figure?  The problem for many folks may be that there are so many outstanding cheaply priced headphones out there by a wealth of different brands, that you can become hesitant in making a decision.  Well, Koss has been around for quite awhile, that's for sure and they have a full life-time warranty (how many other brands provide you with that?).  But I'm telling you right now (and I review these things for living), you can do better (far better) within the price range the R80's list for.I gave them 3 stars only because of what might have been.  Costing twice as much as some of the most heralded Koss entry level headphones (that punch far above their weight sound-wise), the R80's just didn't cut the mustard.  So 3 stars is where it stands.
I kind of am on a KOSS kick right now and bought these looking for something lighter than my gaming headset, with better sound quality. These deliver on both fronts, they are very light due to the mostly plastic construction, but yet not having that worrying cheap feeling.The sound is very balanced, my PC and phone doesn't have any trouble driving these, however to get a proper amount of bass I have to either EQ it in or crank the volume so hard that that I nearly hurt my ears, though i have to say I've never enjoyed nearly damaging my hearing this much without being at a live performance.Going to try out something a bit newer and higher up the Koss lineup for something with more bass, but really if you don't "need" big bass, and just want high fidelity and a neutral profile, these are THE deal, can wear them for hours at reasonable volumes.
I bought this to replace a Plantronics Gamertron headset. That Plantronics headset has been the longest lasting and most comfortable to date of any I have owned. The speakers still work beautifully but the headband broke with no warning which makes them need to be balanced on your head to use them. I would have gone with the same headset except I have no need for the mic since I use my computer's built in mic.Sound QualityIn comparison, The Koss headset is also very comfortable and has wonderful sound. Though I am no audio expert I would even hazard that it is a bit better than the Plantronics Gametron which also has very good sound quality for both music and voice. The Ear enclosure seems a little small, my ears fit fine but if I had larger ears I might find the fit a bit tight. On first putting them on it feels echoey inside them which may be related to the small size, but when the sound comes through it is very clear. Music is beautiful and voice for chatting is also very clear and seems like people are in the room with you.Noise CancellationNoise cancellation is not 100% but it is almost more than I should have, as I do not hear when people are talking to me while listening to anything. When no sound is coming through the speakers you can hear muffled outside sounds.ComfortThe ear pads seem a little firmer than the Plantronics but still gives a nice cushioning. The only drawback is that it pushes a bit more on the earpiece of eyeglasses, if you wear them, and after an extended period this is noticeable. I find myself adjusting my glasses to a slightly different position now and then to keep them comfortable on my temples. Some may find the small size of the ear cups uncomfortable for extended periods compared to more roomy closed ear cups. This is not an issue for me.As my head is on the small side, I have to adjust the headset to its smallest size and the ear cups are still almost propped on the tops of my ears. I was concerned about this at first but have not found it to be a comfort issue.The leatherette cushion cover seems like it will stay cleaner (at least from cat hair fuzz, etc.) than the fuzzy cloth of my previous set which was difficult to clean but very soft and comfortable.ConvenienceI was skeptical about the coiled cord thinking it might drag across my desk a lot but have decided it is superior to the straight cords. It stays out of the way, does not tangle in my various peripherals and is safer from inadvertent cat mishaps. The description of this product says that the cord is detachable, which it is not. I would very much have liked for it to have a detachable, and thus replaceable, cord as was described.SummationAll in all this is a very nice quality headset for the price. It falls just short of the comfort level of my previous Plantronics GameCon headset but not by much. It is also lighter weight which is always good for extended use, though the newer GameCon models may now be lighter weight as well.
I bought these headphones in December of 2013, and they died yesterday, the last day or 2016. For the price, three years of heavy use is pretty reasonable.Sound quality: I'm very much not an audiophile, but I found the sound quality to be perfectly satisfactory. I tend to not like much bass, as it triggers migraines fo me, and I never had a problem with these. If you like bass boost, these are not the headphones for you.Comfort: As you can see from the title, I found these to be incredibly comfortable. The headband is padded and does not press uncomfortably on the head. The ear cups are incredibly plush amd large, making a great deal around the entire ear. The cup cushion is deep enough I never had my ear press against the speaker, even when laying on my side on a pillow. I later purchased a pair of 'sleep headphones' and found I still preferred these. After maybe an hour of use the speaker wafer in the sleep headphones would hurt my ear pressed against the pillow, whereas these were so cushy and completely surrounded my ear and were able to be worn for hours at a time in any position.Functionality: Being corded headphones, for as long as they lasted they just worked. There was no crackling or sound distortion, just crisp sound. I got these to watch video on my tablet or smartphone, and wanted a shorter cord than nearly all of the similar models offered. Yes, it is 8 feet, but really is only around 3.5 feet coiled. It can comfortably stretch to around 5 feet before tension on the coil would begin to pull on the headphones or put pressure on the jack.The fact that the cable is not detachable is a drawback. Being able to swap out cables for intended use would be handy, but wasn't something I needed. Looking back a few years later, I'll be purchasing bluetooth headphones from now on, as the cable was annoying at times. I bought a pair of Bluedio Turbine T2s a few months ago, and found the ear cup cavity to be just a little too small for comfort during extended use, and the padding too shallow so that my ears sometimes pressed uncomfortably against the speaker. The bluetooth feature is nice, plus the great battery life, but I still reverted to these because they were so darn comfy. Now I'm in the market for a new pair, and am using measurements of the ear cups as a basis of my new purchase (Avantree Audition aptX).Bottom line, if you are in the market for a durable, affordable, decent pair of short-corded headphones, these are the best you can buy.
I've had my R/80's for 21 months. They worked fine (and produced adequate sound) with moderate use--not used on a daily basis, almost never stretched (I wore the coil around my neck attached to a 2oz mp3 player), removed from the house only on very rare occasions, etc.--for about 18 months. At that point I started to get a crackle as the cord weakened internally. It wasn't too bad, just something that happened when I moved and stretched the coiled cord every once in a while. I just used them through it.Now, a few months later, I can barely get sound to come out of them. "No problem," I figure. "The cord is replaceable after all. The headphones themselves are perfectly fine, and I can just have Koss send me a new cord. Their warranty is touted as good all the time, right?"WRONG.Koss got back to me with their solution today. Send them the headphones (shipped at *my* cost, which is about $10.50 for USPS "if-it-fits-it-ships") AND a check for $9 and they'll consider sending me a replacement about a month later.They want me to spend about $20 (look up top for how much a brand new pair would cost)and be without the headphones in the interim. And they of course don't guarantee they'll handle the request. (Though I suspect they would, to be fair, it's OBVIOUS that the cable has failed.)All to replace a single cord that costs pennies and should not have failed were it properly constructed. A cord which only a Koss customer with a viable set of headphones has any use for.I have a much better solution. Let everyone know what a terrible warranty Koss has, and that their gear DOES wear out even if you're not a HEAVY user.Oh, and buy a new pair of AT's from Amazon. If past shipping speed is any indicator they'll be here by the end of the week, and I'm not even a prime member anymore.So, in the end, if you want a pair of headphones that you know you're going to throw away, buy these. (And be aware that the more stress you put on the cord by stretching it or taking it into rough environments, the sooner it will break.)If you want a pair of headphones that you're actually going to keep, go with a different company.Or, spend hundreds of dollars on a pair from Koss so that when they ask you to pay them for the privilege of fixing their broken junk it's not such a huge percentage of the brand new price.
Great sound, deep, but light bass - although not without girth - and wonderful overall detail. Really, really, great separation, detail, etc., even by audiophile standards.- however, despite the enormous design these are about as transparent to sound as open-back, but weirder than that, the sound your do hear from outside is very resonant, as if the cups are not damped, although the sound from the cans does not suffer from this.. So, for general listening, I'd say these are easily superior to my Shure SRH840, with a similar low-end but SUPERIOR mid/high clarity - just SMOOTH, and waaaay better than MDR 7506. I'm not just talking frequency curve, I mean actual detail. I'd suspect you could really compete with $500 cans with these - in a blind test, lol!I returned them, however, because I needed them for studio, and on-set work as secondaries, and the lack of isolation (and possible weak headband) made me have to send them back, although, such a nice sound. If you buy these, you may never ever buy another pair, and will find it hard to get speakers under $1000 as smooth and detailed... wow, I sound like a Koss rep! I'm not, I just wish I could have found anything with proper isolation which sound as nice.
I bought the Koss R-80 Home Headphones, ACLgiants Premium Gold plated 3.5mm Stereo male to female 50 foot cable, and the Koss VC20 Volume Control all at the same time.  I had the other connecting wires and plugs.  The purpose was to connect my HDTV-U-Verse Cable Box Sound Out (Red & White) to a volume controlled head phones, allowing me to adjust the volume on the TV for my wife to listen to, and then the volume for me using the headphones.  I wired the 50 foot stereo cable under the floor, as I have access under the floor from the basement, in order to have the  connection be as invisible as possible.  I may not of needed the 50 foot cable, but felt it was important if the furniture ever gets moved around.  What I can tell you is that it all worked!  The sound quality of the Koss R-80, with the 16Hz-22kHz range, which to me is an important factor, allows excellent sound reproduction and no issues.  I have another pair of headphones that are much more sensitive 5Hz-24kHz range, but they cost $200.  Oh, and I first tried to use a blue tooth 4.0 connection , but that to me, proved more trouble (paring each time I wanted to use and single dropping), that I returned it and opted for the wired setup.  Like I wrote earlier, everything worked perfectly right out of the box.  Excellent value.
I'm not a audio-hound. I bought these headphones to watch movies as I don't listen to much music. These phones have a great sound. Like others who have noted the enhanced bass, I love the bass. I view them as no-nonsense headphones. They delvier great sound but do not have the extra bells and whistles of more expensive models (as these are very reasonably priced). For example, they do not have the sound adjustment switch on the cord and the cord is coiled so you're not always dragging around cord that's continuously getting hung up on something. The only down side I have noticed is fairly peculiar to people with, how shall we say, over-sized heads. They are comfortable. The foam totally encloses the ear so that there's no sound loss or outside sound distractions. But I do have to occasionally readjust their position when listening to long movies to avoid feeling cramped. The head band does adjust but does not offer a wide range of expansion. To put this in perspective, I have a pair of PhillipsSBC HP250s that I can't wear for more than 30 minutes without getting a headache. I also have a pair of Panasonic RP-HT355S that are far more comfortable but aren't as comfortable as these. Other than that small inconvenience, I would highly recommend these phones, particularly to people who don't place high demands on audio tolerances but just want to watch a movie with great sound. As a matter of fact, I am considering getting a second set to take to work to listen to talk radio.

I had already gotten a pair of Koss headphones that were amazing. Unfortunately, college dormmates are not always careful with your things, so I had to replace them. When I saw that these were considered better, I gave them a try. And they have not disappointed!The bass is deep and rich. The sound quality is excellent. And while the noise-cancelling isn't anything amazing, it is still good. I do a lot of gaming, so these headphones are perfect for me. Would highly recommend them, especially considering the more than generous price.

Extremely fun headphone. EQ is a must since they sound pretty dark out of the box. They're quite comfortable despite being pretty chonky. Soundstage and layering isn't amazing on these like something from Hifiman, but it is extremely detailed and articulate, plus they won't fall apart in a year. You'll be able to pick up the subtlest sounds with ease.  Amazing sub bass (exceptional dynamic range, descent amount of slam), crisp mids and treble. They're slightly rolled off on treble which is nice for me since It makes longer listening sessions more enjoyable. I like to listen to a lot of busy tracks (mainly EDM/electronic). They sound pretty forward without being too much. Vocals and instruments sound natural (vocals to me sounded artifical on Sundaras and Anandas). These respond to EQ very well so you can tune them to your personal preference. One thing to note is that you will need an amp with some juice. I run these off of a Onkyo home theater receiver, which has plenty headroom. Tried them out with a JDS atom and Shiit magni heresy and they left a lot on the table compared to what I was able to get out with the Onkyo. Love these headphones very much. I'd compare them to the 2-C, but I've never listened to them. I also haven't had any issues with the screws on the can to strap couple like some have had (blue Loctite if any issues) and the factory cable is very good as well. This headphone is not going to be everyone's favorite, but it definitely checked the boxes for me. If instrument separation and soundstage are extremely important to you, I'd probably look for something else. I only have limited experience with different headphones, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. However I've personally never listened to anything that made me so impressed every time I put them on. Oh big plus I forgot to mention. Audeze is located and manufactures their headphones here in the states. They offer a 3 year warranty on the drivers as well. I truly gave Hifiman a chance but when you get a defective unit out of the box it kind of leaves a bitter taste on the tongue.TLDR: amazing headphone, natural, articulate, and crisp. Slightly rolled off treble. Fantastic sub bass dynamics. Need a beefy amp. Cost a pretty penny, but worth it imo.
These headphones are great for watching Avengers: Endgame but that's about it. Just kidding, you know what the term means. In case you don't, "endgame" means it's of such a quality that you don't need to ever upgrade. And it's a term which I think more than appropriately describes these headphones.They are heavy, but it's one of my favorite qualities of the headphones. They are made of metal and they feel like EQUIPMENT, not like headphones. They come with a travel box which is also a great place to store the headphones. It carries the idea that these are cans worth treating like royalty, which is true not for the spectacular build quality, but for the sound quality as well.After all, what the hell would be the point of buying headphones in this price range if they didn't sound great? The truth is, they are sublime. The sound is full because it has great, deep bass and crispy highs as well as some of the most beautiful mids you can imagine. I am not a fan of the higher end of the frequency range, but the LCD-X give just the right amount. BE CAREFUL! There is a massive difference between the 2021 version and the one that came before. I bought the older model and I thought its frequency response was an abomination so I returned them immediately for a full refund.I won't be taking these back and I'll probably be using these for the rest of my days. If anything THEY will outlive me.
Note: heavy but not uncomfortable.Long winded breakdown oh yeah! I use these headphones for mixing (at home) and also use them for listening to music or to watch movies. They are enjoyable even when single-ended! I would say for what they are advertised to do, they fill the role of mixing and tread a bit outside as a listening pair (mixing headphones and listening headphones are NOT the same). They don't have a large Soundstage, but the stage given happens to be natural, not fake. Don't confuse this with placement of actual staging, where the middle is a touch vague (for mixing I can still tell I'd the vocalist is centered or to a side) when used for games. The bass is the only 'problem', with the response being linear enough that if you add some with eq or use something like ifi's true bass or xbass, you will be more than amused! The tonality is well balanced, with a noticeable dip at 3.7khz and a large cavity-like recess at about 9.56khz to 10khz. Those dips however, are not a problem for me, as adding too much at 3.7khz back can add some coloration (2db to 3db on Equalizer APO would be a safe range, with the latter as your maximum (q width of about 1 to 1.5)).Summary; this headphone is very enjoyable, and it's weight is not a problem in the slightest since the weight is evenly distributed. The seal is good for glasses wearers, and the tonality is inoffensive. With some eq, you can find a sweetspot for 3.7khz to emphasize the already present texture to vocals, cymbals, or snare drums. The stage and overall 'sound' is natural, while adding detail galore, and being fun at the same time. And they are neutral enough to mix in for either the amateur or the pro. To me, this is my temporary endgame. I recommend these headphones whole heartedly, alongside a good clean dac and amp.
I used to think typical good value audiophile headphones all sounded decent (beyerdynamic dt990 250ohm) but they all sounded the same to me. The day I put these on after they came in was the day I felt my hair crease due to my inability to take these off. I have never heard something so close to a live concert experience wearing headphones or listening to speakers. With these, you wont need to research 192kb lossless, because mp3's on these sound better than lossless on any other headphone. Adding lossless to these and you feel something magical. The sound quality of the mids is surreal and the bass is extremely fast with no bleed due to the amazing planar magnetics, not to mention the highs are bright enough but never overwhelming. Soundstage isn't insane, but with the clarity and paring of balanced cables, good dac and amp, it will show through. Build quality is extremely good, all metal build feels very sturdy but can be much heavier than expected. Some people say they can't have these on for more than an hour but I can easily wear these for over 5 without a need to take them off. Sometimes it needs adjustments due to my larger ears touching the fazors on the inside but nevertheless a great lounging or chilling headphone. Watching movies with these feels better than an actual movie theater where sound intimacy is at the highest. Make sure you EQ these if you get them, there's quite a few EQ settings for these and they all make it better than new. The cables it comes with are expensive and seemingly fragile so keep them from kinking or pulling, otherwise opt in for some balanced XLR cables off amazon or somewhere else. Don't believe what other reviewers say when these aren't "endgame" headphones, I don't ever see myself spending 5x the price of these for 5% more quality especially with the advantage these have over typical 500$ headphones. If you AREN'T a hypercritical audiophile, buy these and don't look anywhere else, you will find yourself in a rabbit hole spending money like a kid in a candy store.10/10
These made me cry when listening to Scream by Asaka on my GSX1000 and JDS Atom Amp. Headphones are made of hiqh quality material and are very clean, deep sounding headphones. Highs know where to stop in intensity so they are not shrill and the bass hits really low. The bass is quite deep which i love for r&b/rock but it isn't super boomy if that makes sense. Clean, powerful bass. The size of the drivers makes the sound feel big. The mids are clean and I'm able to hear suttle noises I didn't notice before such as the artist muttering before singing or other background instruments that use to fuse with the louder sounds. The clariy is outstanding. I love all genres of music on these so far. They have yet to disappoint. For some orchestra music I do like the extra clean sound of my HD700s as well as their superior comfort. I believe my HD700s are good for when my ears get tired from the weight or if I want to listen to more calm content. These headphones are heavy and they do weigh down on the ears quite a bit if you have them on for a couple hours which is another reason why I will switch to my HD700s. Besides that, I am very satisfied. Make sure you EQ these to get the most out of them. A must.
The Audeze LCD X 2021 are the BEST HEADPHONES FOR VALUE OF MONEY, Period! The Sounds coming from this headphone r the most truest to the music! It produces a common copy of the actual recording w/o any coloring to the music. If there‚Äôs a lot of bass in the recording, then these cans will produce you a lot of bass. If there‚Äôs little to less bass, then it‚Äôll feed you little to less bass.It‚Äôs simply the best ALL-ROUNDER headphone, period! Every genre of music sounds like the recording: And because of this, it‚Äôs Excellent for Mixing/Mastering. If there‚Äôs an end-game headphone - The Audeze LCD X will be it.I didn‚Äôt think the Audeze LCD X could be any better but the 2021 version simply out-classed the older LCD X and def rivals the LCD 5.I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE 2021 AUDEZE LCD X!!!
These headphones are absolutely incredible. If you are reading this im sure you‚Äôve read other reviews.  These have incredible tonality, imaging, and sound stage.  These are ‚Äúreference‚Äù headphones geared toward music production and will need some boost in the low frequencies for most people. But they respond perfectly to EQ and sound incredible.
These replaced both my Focal Elears and HD800's. Combo with Roon, use their Audeze EQ curves and this headphone just sounds perfect. It's heavy, very open, and in a warm room it's a sweaty beast like any other large set of cans, but I can't stress enough how fantastic these feel and sound. If you can afford these, don't hesitate.
Definitely an improvement, with a bit of weight loss and some actually decent tuning, making the LCD-X competitive with higher tier and more expensive cans. Their still the heaviest in my collection but are sonically weightier then most along with its better dynamics, instrument separation and sound stage. The combined upgrades including - upgraded earpads, lighter weight and better tuning + Fazor Phase tweaking,  allow for more listening enjoyment without the need to EQ.  I fully appreciate the upgrades and most highly recommended them as they have slightly edged-out my recently purchased Focal MG Pro as my personnel Top Tier.
is a little heavy.  With my big noggin I've literally maxed out the rods to fit on my head.  Very comfortable as the weight is well-distributed.  However you'll feel it after a few hours.  Overall they're sound fantastic, a little dark which I'd preferred.  They're good for any genre of music.  Good little investment if you're enjoy music during quiet nights OR days.  Comes highly recommended!

Sounds good
Headphones came packaged really good. They are great, sound is great and connects easily to smart tv and phone but after a while it is no longer comfortable on ear. Pressure on ear starts to hurt. This is the only complaint so far on headset. At first they felt comfy but found a long period of an hr is all it took to start feeling it tight on ears and a bit painful but battery lasted good.
My expectations weren‚Äôt exactly met; however the T450BT are a decent set of earphones. I had, prior to these, T510. Which I liked very much not they broke (brittle plastic) but the sound quality of the T450 as the stereo sound is as good. My only complaint is the battery life it is half of the T510
Excellent quality
my only complaint is wind noise, pretty comfortable, and a god send when someone is playing music or talking nonstop on the phone next to you, great for commuting, better than ear buds which never fit me right and sound like S$%^.  fits in my travel bag. the jury's still out on the durability
Sounds great with good bass. Set up was easy and quick. The only thing I might miss is no jack input if I wanted to bypass the blue tooth. Solid value.
I use these with Bluetooth to my iphone when I mow my lawn. It takes about 4 hours to mow and these stay charged the whole time. Would recommend.
Listen music
Good product
I didn't like how they fit. They're too hard. The plug doesn't stay in my phone. I have to keep connecting it to the Bluetooth. Just wasn't a good product. I am returning it.

Just received and pleased with how easy it was to set up. No pairing required. Plug and hear. Still using it. So far, after 20 minutes it goes off. Not sure what I‚Äôm doing wrong but will figure it out I‚Äôm sure. No phone number or troubleshooting tips in the manual. I‚Äôm sure this will be a good product for a long time.Not sure why I‚Äôm asked to review products day after receiving the products. They should wait at least a week or two.
I did not want blue tooth headphones due to living in a very rural area where signals are weak.  The first set of these headphones I returned as the receiver just stopped working.  After trying a couple of other brands, I went back to these and so far, they are working fine.  They were easy to set up for this 72-year-old woman who often struggles with such things. The headphones are a little tight on the ears, especially if one uses hearing aids as well.  The sound is exactly what I needed as I can now hear what is being said on the TV with clarity.  I also don't have to bother anyone else in the house with a blaring TV on.  I like that I can move around the house, and I don't miss anything.  I do not like the volume switches as they are not easily found with touch.  After a while one gets a general idea where they are at but a nodule or bump to help identify them would be beneficial for deft fingers like mine.I bought another pair for my bedroom as well so when I have company, I am not blasting anyone out of the house at night!
I was pretty satisfied with these headphones until they stopped working just 60 days after purchase.  Unfortunately, I returned them for a refund.
This is great for people who can‚Äôt hear as good anymore. My grandma couldn‚Äôt watch tv without the volume being very loud but now with this we can all watch tv together. She can listen at her own volume while the rest of the family can enjoy the tv at a normal volume. The battery lAsts a few hours making it great. This is my second pair I have bought because my first pair lasted about a year but they were used almost everyday.
Ear coverage and noise cancellation is good. My only criticism is that the sound can‚Äôt go low enough.
I desired for a headphones that were RF, accepted optical input, and at a reasonable price. This one did fit the bill as hoped. Bass and mid-range are perfect, but treble is lacking. If you want perfect sound reproduction, spend some real money on a higher quality product. Oddly, the lowest volume level isn't as low as you might expect. I discovered that the battery life increased greatly after I fully discharged and then recharged the unit even after the charge light went out. Very impressive kit with all the included items. Worth every penny.
The sound on these are remarkable.  I feel like I am in a movie theater, the bass is so good!  They were a little big for my head but a little extra foam rubber fixed that.  I use them outside on my porch to watch TV.  I am right in the flight path of a major airport and now the planes no longer block out the sound.  Once I have the sound adjusted I‚Äôm set for the night.  They are very comfortable and not sweaty at all.
I connected the transmitter to my TV via the Infra-red Optical cable and I get excellent sound!Only 1 problem with this unit is that I only use them at night, and I turn off the headset and place on charger, but the next time I go to use them there is a loud bunch of static coming out. I found the fix. I remove the USB Power from the transmitter and plug it in and the problem is resolved, but I must do this every night!
I got these when a noisy neighbor moved in above me. The noise cancellation was good, but would be better if I could adjust the fit smaller.  You can also only turn the volume down to a certain level before it simply mutes.  It crackles and squeals occasionally when I turn them on, but fixes by disconnecting and reconnecting the transmitter to the tv.Overall a very good product considering most of the others are double the price or more.
very easy to set up. ok sound quality not bad for the money. volume controls in awkward location. keep hitting sync button when i want to adjust volume.

I originally bought a pair of Sony Xm4‚Äôs but could not stand the build quality. They felt like if I breathed on them wrong then the plastic hinges would break. These are great in comparison, though I bought a used pair for well under half MSRP.Pros:Sound quality is the best of any headphone I‚Äôve had before, even to the Sony Xm4‚Äôs which are overhyped in my opinion.Build quality is the best for a headphone. They feel well built yet light enough to not feel uncomfortable after hours of use. They feel like they‚Äôll last me the next 10 years.Touch controls:Most people complain about the controls but wow I realized how many people just don‚Äôt bother trying out new way with the controls. These controls are great, but here‚Äôs the thing, LEARN THEM. At first I was accidentally turning on transparency mode and it was frustrating, but I whipped out the manual and practiced a little bit and it helped a ton. A lot of people complain about the volume controls, though I found by applying a bit more pressure to the pad it was always consistent. I think a lot of people are a bit too soft-touched with these when a firm touch reads very well.Cons:I bought these used. Buy them used. I got mine for $250 and wow were they well worth. The near $500 original tag is a crazy price to ask for headphones. My Sony‚Äôs were $350 new and I returned them because I felt like they were very cheaply made for that price. If I paid $350 for these I would still be happy, but that‚Äôs the limit.ANC is okay but not as good as the Xm4‚Äôs. Personally this isn‚Äôt an issue to me since I found the Xm4‚Äôs ANC a bit overkill for me. I used to think ANC was this amazing technology that would change the way I heard music forever, but it‚Äôs not the end-all-be-all as some people make it out to be.Battery life is great at around 24hrs with ANC on, but I do miss the 35hr duration of my Xm4‚Äôs.NO HARD CASE: if I bought these new I would be livid that there‚Äôs no hard case, used at $250 is still a bit of why not include one. The pouch is stupid (though it‚Äôs a nice pouch so I‚Äôll use it for other things, but now I‚Äôve got to find a nice hard case)The headband. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. These are very comfortable in my opinion, though it depends on if you want on ear or over ear. Im very happy with the headband but I‚Äôm sure many will find it frustrating that the material has very little friction with hair and tends to slide. This is a nitpick, because I love these headphones and the material but want others to know.Overall these are solid headphones. I bought used and do not regret 1 bit. The sound quality is best in class. Build quality is unmatched. ANC works but isn‚Äôt the best. Touch controls get too much criticism from people who don‚Äôt bother learning to use them. Learn to use them and apply a bit more pressure and they will be consistent.If you have more money and don‚Äôt care about spending then go for them new. For average people like me pick smart with a used pair and enjoy the best headphones you can get at this price range.
I first listened to a Bang and Olufsen sound system in a BMW M6 and was very impressed. Once I saw they made headphones I knew I had to get them. I was blown away by the sound quality and craftsmanship. Such a simple design and app but so good.I was deciding on keep these or the JBL CLUB ONE's. Here is my comparison of the two.JBL CLUB ONE's vs BANG AND OLUFSEN H9ANC - H9's win here. Although very close the H9's have very good anc without having to have the volume blasting all the way up.Style - JBL wins this. What I like about the JBL can be read above. The style of the H9 is modern, nice, and simple. There is nothing wrong with it. I have DJ'd in the past so thats maybe why I lean towards the JBL's design.Sound - H9 wins. I spent over a month listening to both. At first I loved the JBL's, bass was good, vocals were great, but again slightly muffled. I sent back the Sony's 1000XM$ 2 days after I got them FYI. The H9's are crisp, clean and bassy. Everything about the H9's are simple, the design and the app interface with equalization. As for sound, the distinctive instruments and crisp notes were what sold me. The bass is also very good on the H9's.One grip I have with these headphones though is the presentation. The box is nice but the way the headphones and cables are laid out in the box looks kinda cheap. The aux cable is so much thinner than my Beats cable from my last pair of headphones and looks like something from the 99 cents store. And no hard case Bang and Olufsen? I admit the bag is really nice but protection wise, I would've liked to see a hard case.In all, these Bang and Olufsen H9's are top quality headphones. You get what you pay for. I love the sound and bass on these and actually want to chill and listen to them.
I have not used any headphones with capable ANC in the past so I don't have much to compare this to except the other headphones I tested.This is a very impressive headphone. It is comfortable one the ears, that is not always easy to find. Sound quality is great. I has good mid and high sounds. Bass is great, however, it may need a tiny bit of a boost for the bass, however, I cannot complain about the sound quality, it is exceptional, great surround and loudness.My only gripe it is not quite loud enough, don't get me wrong, the highest volume is pretty loud but I could use more. That being said, there is a quality about it I like, it is loud, but not uncomfortable. Somehow the sound does not hurt your ears at high volume, maybe because it is not extremely loud. Great engineering on the loud-comfort scale.The Noise cancelling is probably the most amazing thing I've noticed, it adjust depending on the environment. On the train the loud hum of the train is gone dramatically and the sound is not too loud and you can enjoy the music on a loud train.Controls can take some getting used to but they work well. Battery life is also incredible. I've gotten almost about over 18hrs constant play without charging. By this I mean all the cumulative hours before charging. It's not even dead yet. I'll let you guys know. I'm happy with it. Price is a bit steep but it is worth the technology IMO.
These headphones are amazing. The super comfortable big ear cups are nice for extended listening and the leather is very soft. The Bluetooth actually works without being super fussy. Being able to use an audio cable is an added bonus for those of us that don‚Äôt like Bluetooth. The round ear cups on these H9s are are actually more comfortable than the oval ear cups on the H95s and for 1/2 the price! That being said, the H95s are tighter fitting, allowing a bit more movement before the headphones start moving around. I love that you can turn off the noise canceling feature easily, but I wish it would stay on your selected setting, rather than defaulting to noise canceling every time it powers on.  The H95s don‚Äôt have this issue, probably because the noise canceling it controlled by a physical dial, whereas the H9s have the controls on the touch surface on the right earpiece. It is nice to have all the controls in one place. Overall, I like these H9s so much I bought two. Almost as nice as the H95s, but a lot less expensive.
These are the most comfortable headphones I have ever owned, and I have owned quite a few in the same price range. However, the cable is as cheap as it can be (I do not like the BT compressed sound). I had connectivity issues, and I had to replace it with my own. The sound is solid. Not quite Bowers quality, but satisfying. Suites my taste. I need to say I am a rock and roll guy and like to relax with jazz and soul.The highs are "glass break" crystal clear. The mids are little subdued but still there. The lows are butter soft. There is definitely lack of mid-lows but it suites the needs of a rock and roll guy.They are not perfect by any means, but I will not return them.Hope this helps.
Well 2 for 2 on Amazon. Return the Jabra, and then had to return these. But not because I didn't like them. I found them 100 cheaper on another site. These headphone feel so good and comfortable. Around your neck, they feel like a true accessory, light, and supple. Yes, the sheepskin ear piece make a difference. It's not just a luxury, but pillow on your ears.ANC doesn't interfere or change the sound at all! I mean ZERO. It does what it's supposed to, remove background noise. Most natural ANC transition I've tried period. Bluetooth volume is equally impressive.Sound quality is incredible, just wish they sounded more open..however they perform as good as Bose/ Sony in that regard.If you plan on doing more than a casual walk, they will feel too loose. For a stroll, or sitting, perfect headband.Wish Amazon did price matching. It's a waste to have to return them a day later for a significant price change.
Made in China shows.  Overall quality is  70%.  For that amount of money a Case is a must.  The leather band is poor quality.  Seems like an after thought.  The head piece adjustment is good but few other pluses to justify the price.  I am returning the set because it does not live up to the known quality from B & O
I would agree with some previous reviewers.It is 500$. You‚Äôd expect sound 5-10 times better than JBL or Bose. No. Nothing like this. Just a brand and design. It‚Äôs even not loud enough.Design is good, customer service is great, but sound is sucks.
I really like my new headphone. Quiet pricey, but it is well-made and the quality of the sound is much better than any earphones I have owned and/or returned because of dissatisfaction.
Better than the previous model

Perfect for my phone using an equalizer app but I wish I got the product in a box. Having it in a bag is asking for it to be potentially damaged in transit. Thankfully mine was all A-OK and working.
There isn't anything to dislike about this product.  It wears and functions well.
I love the sound quality and these headphones are comfortable...BUT...as I experienced discomfort only with long hours ( I like to occasionally binge programs) in the bony outer part of my right ear that became sore and was painful. Good thing at the same time, I also purchased EARPHONES just in case of any unforeseen issues. Glad I had them to give my ear a rest. Haven't went back to the Headphones yet since the earphones worked equally as well, Still very much like these Headphones though. I recommend to Buy...for short term use.
just what I wanted.
Audio is clear, equal both ears and comfortable
I use these for the gym 3-4 times a week and needed some that wouldn't slide off my head. These are perfect fit. Pricing is good and shipping was quick. Sound quality is a little muffled but not bad for my workouts. A little padding in the band would be nice. I would buy these again.
These headphones are fine for ordinary use on a laptop, and a good value for the money.Pros: the cord is long enough so that I can pick up the laptop with the headphone still on and move from a table to a desk. The sound is fine for an economical headphone but probably would not work well for video gaming or listening to music.Cons: I can still hear conversations, the TV, and household noises with the headphones on, but that is to be expected since they are not advertised as "sound cancelling." The headpiece, although it can be adjusted for length, does not swivel at the earpiece. It felt a little tight at first but is comfortable now. I think these are probably made for use in school labs.Overall I would recommend it as a good value.
I found this inexpensive head set to work well with my laptop. The soft ear cups are comfortable and the unit seems durable. A good value for everyday use.

Unit well made just the right fit

My only complaint is they could be more fitting to the ears.
Bought them to sleep with at night while listening to sleep music. While I loved the shaggy lion on the outside beneath this soft exterior the plastic ear phones were way to hard on my ears! Very uncomfortable.
It‚Äôs got super soft fur but,not that adjustable and the sound doesn‚Äôt get that loud.  The ear parts aren‚Äôt super comfortable  My daughter loves them but I just don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre worth $25  Like it‚Äôs not great of quality sound wise either I feel like it could be louder.
These headphones are great for small children.  Not only do my kids love fun designs, The headphones actually STAY on their little-tiny heads while they watch or play on a device.  Another thing this mama loves about this product is that they don't have those tiny little circle foam covers that are next to IMPOSSIBLE to put back on after a child most surely pulls them off ... every time.So, why do I give the ReTrak Animalz shark only a 3 star rating after all of the raving I just did?  2 things: 1. the retractable cord is REALLY thin, like... paper thin.  I am always reminding the kids not to play with the super fun retractable cord b/c it could very easily break.  And #2.  After only 2 days of use, one side/speaker stopped working.  I have no idea how to fix it due to its fluffy encasement, and now my son doesn't want to wear them b/c it's annoying when only one side works.  I would have tried to return/swap out, but it's past the 30 day return policy at this point.
I thought they were cute upon receiving them and liked them up until recently when the cord frayed after just 7 months of occasional light use at home. My daughter is 9 y/0 and is very gentle with her things. I would definitely NOT buy them again.
My daughter really wanted these for school. I was nervous due to the reviews but went for it.Just got a message from the teacher that they are not working. For the $ these cost not to last is ridiculous.  Pretty upset about this.
The sound has already stopped working in one side. :(
This seller sent a set of KID'S headphones to my son. An item that was previously returned to the seller. IT SAYS SO ON THE PACKAGING! So, obviously they knew it was defective, yet they sent it on to ANOTHER KID! So, my kid has Down Syndrome. He saved his money for a long time to buy these headphones for himself. He was so brokenhearted that they wouldn't work. If any of you know anything about children with Down Syndrome, you will understand when I say that he perseverates about it constantly. Poor little guy. Besides that, it took WEEKS to get here. So I helped him pick out 2 other headphones from a different seller. In the future, I hope this seller doesn't knowingly send broken products to children. (They were Specifically marketed for children.) $30 bucks down the drain. This is the era if Covid. People are already hard up. Why cause more pain?
I bought these headphones as a gift for my daughter she‚Äôs been using them for a month and they no longer work...
Christmas gift

So, you could say I'm a bit of an Audio Technica loyalist. I've been comparing their products to other sound companies since 2009 -- music really helped get me through my first trip to Afghanistan. None of my purchases with them have gone over $300, so as far as a company like Sennheiser is concerned, there's some limitations... But whether it be AKG, Sony, Bose -- I've had a history of buying two products from different companies around the same time to do a comparison. Why? If I'm going to be deaf by 40, I want to make sure I enjoy the sounds up to that point.Either way, I recently decided to hit the refresh with what goes over my ears. I'm guilty of actually returning to a using the Audio Technica ATH-AD900 (not with the X) the most over the last decade, since my original purchase forever ago -- YOU KNOW! The flashy headphones with that beautiful pink open-air siding! They're great headphones, still. Either way, to this product... Strap in folks, I'm not gruntled by what I've seen from other reviews.When looking over the critical reviews that seem to get helpful votes, they seem to float around the 3-Star mark, but for weird reasons. I read one that said too many of the headphone components were plastic. 1. What do you expect? 2. Did you take the headphones apart to examine the components that are actually producing the sound? 3. Not all plastic is junk, and while -- sure -- I can expect increased durability from a headphone frame made with nickel or whatever other metal alloy... If you can get at least three years out of your plastic framed headphones (almost every headphone has plastic on the market) without a break, that's a victory.I read another review that was critical of the bass for these headphones, saying there was none. That review floored me. While this is not a 1-to-1 comparison, I'm at the point with my current car that the sound system is worth a couple thousand more than the car itself. I have a great deal of appreciation for good CLEAN bass that doesn't obstruct the mids and highs that make musician's music *shine*... Y'all, these headphones have bass. They have bass not only where they are supposed to have bass, but in pleasantly unexpected places that in my opinion make relevant recent music better. For instance, for Lady Gaga's Stupid Love, you can tell that it is supposed to have a persistent and pleasant bass kicker going throughout the song. These headphones when NOT wired, accomplish making that kicker immersive... On their own... As in, you don't have to play around with the bass settings of whatever machine you're listening to music on, and I think that's effing fantastic.This is when I'm going to talk about why I'm actually really appreciative of these headphones. I originally wasn't going to leave a review yet because the first set I got in the mail was defective. One of the ear pieces was facing outside, which of course would make listening to music with both ears a bit difficult. Either way -- I said "screw it," to give the quality a check after confirming getting my replacement through Amazon. (Thank you Amazon Customer Support -- Bezos needs to pay all you folks more than you do get paid). If we lived in some alternate dimension where I was a sports 'caster only being able to used a headphone and mic set on one ear, leaving the other exposed... I would write an angry letter to Audio Technica demanding why they made all other headsets disappointing in comparison. I say this while also letting you all know that I recently purchased Audio Technica ATH-ADG1X headset with mic.  Don't get me wrong, it's a solid headset that is built specifically for gaming and NOT studio production... But the M50xBT sound quality is in a different league. Whatever, besides the point.These headphones are great. I haven't tried listening to music with the aux cable in use. I think I read another review saying there is a difference in quality, as if that's a bad thing. Y'all, of course sound quality through a cable is going to be improved compared to something sent through the air-waves. Do you think the music your listening to on the radio is going to be the same quality as when you listen to it via disk, FLAC, or WAV? Come on... Please, appreciate the care that has gone into a good set of wireless headphones that still lets you plug in.So, yeah. I'm disappointed that I got a defective product from Audio Technica. I'm not going to hold it against them though because even if defective, I can still tell that it's a superior product, and I'm just going to treat this like a practical joke. Like, "hahaha, Dillon, first time buying our wireless headphones, huh? You're late to the party, iDioT!"If you've made it throughout this entire review, you're a champion of patience.Also, I'm writing this review 8June20. Right now, a lot of people are hurting across the world for various reasons and the United States is not immune to the trials and tribulations of human struggles. However, some people experience unfortunate dispositions by being treated differently, and in many cases inhumane, just because of their skin color. I want to applaud Bezos for his firm stance on Black Lives Matter. Although, I think he can definitely afford to not only donate more money to the cause, but also pay his freaking employees more. While being employed is far better than unemployment, that doesn't always guarantee people will thrive or that their struggles will be greatly relieved.Dude, you bald Lex Luthor looking jabroni, pay your people more.TLDR: Black Lives Matter.
When I broke my hyper x's I did some shopping for a new gaming headset. I have always had an appreciation for music. Being in band I understood proper balancing between voices. I wanted a gaming headset that could be dual purpose for also listening to music. At this price point, nothing compares. These audio technicas just sound so clear. I have heard people say they sound flat since they are supposed to be for music editing. I don't disagree. They don't do the bass boosting that most headphones do, but the base is still very present and as someone who turns my bass up to +5 in my car I have never thought that I need more bass when using these headphones so it's a non issue. The Bluetooth on these is decent its nothing groundbreaking, but I have found that other BT headphones around this price have nearly identical BT settings such as delay and decreased sound quality. BT is nice for listening on your phone though. If you don't want to spend more just get the base model.
Pros:- Crystal clear audio, compared to anything else I've listened to.- The single most comfortable pair of headphones that have ever sat on my head - and they're still there now!- Simple and sturdy construction, they're gonna last a while.- Availability for both wired and Bluetooth makes them very versatile.Cons:- I wish the increments for the band adjustment were a bit more pronounced.- Noise cancellation is certainly good, but could be better.- Bluetooth connection is quite laggy. Don't know if this is a fault of the headphones or just Bluetooth.An absolutely amazing pair of headphones, and they single-handedly got me into the audiophile scene. I plan to use these for years to come, and recommend you to do the same.
And I can say that they are the most comfortable headphones I have personally owned. The sound quality is fantastic and the Bluetooth capability is (sometimes) a little funky for me, but I believe thats more of a Windows issue than the actual headset. After 4 years, the ear cuffs are finally starting to wear down, and I am strongly considering ordering the same pair because I've enjoyed them that much. I am a gamer, music lover, and avid cinephile and these headphones are top tier.
Absolutely fantastic headphones!TLDR: I would buy these again without hesitation. I might even have purchased over the ATH-M50x if these were available when I purchased my first pair a few years ago. They sound the same when running directly via 3.5mm cable. They are built the same and they feel the same; very comfortable.Pros:+ Can be used cord free via bluetooth connection.+ Can be used with 3.5mm aux cable without bluetooth (like, oops, I drained my battery or no BT reception).+ Using via 3.5mm cable doesn't require batteries, it's passive, just like any normal headphones (like the ATH-M50x).+ The head phones have a large memory so that it will remember multiple device connections (8 if I remember).+ The reception is good 20-30 feet away from a bluetooth device. I've been able to walk into other rooms or down stairs and remain connected. I'll get a skip or studder depending on distance and number of walls (which is totally normal and to be expected).+ Switching between bluetooth and wired is as easy as connecting the cable. You should turn off the power switch since technically you're not streaming over bluetooth. I accidentally left the BT connection to my phone on and plugged in the cable to my laptop. It worked and I didn't realize until I walked away and returned to see the pulsing white light (I had left on the power switch).+ I can get a few days of 8-hour use before having to charge them again.+ They sound the same as the ATH-M50x when the power is off and they are connected via 3.5mm cable.+ They have a small bump in base over the ATH-M50x when connected via bluetooth.+ Same build quality and feel as standard ATH-M50x head phones.+ Little to no sound leak (using glasses with thick frames will be an exception).+ Although they are not noise cancelling, they do a good job isolating external noise because they are over the ear. With music playing, you won't hear much around you. With music paused, you can hear when people are trying to talk to you (planes, public transit, etc...).Cons (the first two are minor):- The pleather bag that comes with these is really small. Yeah, the headphones fit but it should probably have a minimum of an inch more in length and width. This would help bag not be as tight around the headphones, especially when the cable is there.- After only 8 months, the factory 3.5mm microphone/remote cable that came in the box wore out last week. This was without any drops, yanks, or hard wear and tear. I listen to bluetooth at home and while commuting on the train. I turn off bluetooth in the office and just listen via cable because crApple osx 10.6 has massive bluetooth failures (100% apple, not the headphones).- Micro USB to charge.  Seriously, this is stupid. Micro USB is cheap so that's why people use it in hardware designs, but omg don't try to connect this to power in the dark. It will take you a year to first locate where the port is for power, let alone figuring out if the cable is upside down or not. They should have put up the money for USB-C. it's more robust and is bi-directional. That is my biggest gripe about these, honest. Everything else is tolerable.**Edit**  November 2019It's been a year of daily use for these now. I stand by my origional review. I only wish charging was USB-C type of connector.- Audio still great.- Call clarity still great.- Construction still sturdy.- Battery still holding up.- 3.5mm audio port still holding up.- Single replacement cable still holding up and that's with connecting /disconnecting daily.- Cushions still in great condition.- BT pairing still spot on.Regarding the comment on the factory audio cable:I replaced the broken mic/audio cable with a nice braided cable, 3.5mm on both ends (one side naturally has an extra conductor and insulation band for the mic). For those of you looking to replace a cable, spend the money and don't buy cheap low quality cables; you'll be so much happier with a soft braided cable of higher quality of you need a replacement.
To start, I'm definitely no expert or anything like that. Just a guy that finally had enough of uncomfortable, small,easy to lose and terrible battery earbuds.I work as an Electrician. Have been since I was 15 and I'm 38 now. So I have a ton of experience dealing with every kind of headphone style or earbud style that is on the market. I have gradually spent more for better quality headphones as I get older. And I think I have finally discovered the holy grail for what I am looking for in headphones. I am by no means saying that these are the best in any way or category technically. I have no idea if they are or aren't. Just what my needs and expectations are and how they fit those. I dont need perfection in any category. Just consistency, durability, dependability, ease of every day use, idiot proof Bluetooth pairing that is always fast and smooth, a few special features that are actually something that will be used and the Grand Pubah a BIG MEAN NASTY BAD*** BATTERY.The Audio-Technical ATH-M50BT does all those things but better than even I expected. The sleek matte black color is low key but still cool.The ear pieces are the most comfortable thing I've ever seen or felt. Coming from the earbud life, these feel like you are wearing a giant comfy pillow. I barely know I'm wearing "cans" on my ears. Trust me, if you are easy to please and just looking for something that is any level of comfort above buds, this is a grand slam. I give comfort a perfect 10.The Bluetooth works perfectly every single time I flip the switch on the left side ear piece. It's easy to find and slides right over. Volume can be controlled on the headphones or your device. I paired these to my phone originally in seconds and every time after it automatically links to my phone. Boom done. Simple. Bluetooth and controls is a 10.Sound quality is superb for me. I have a Note 9 which has an equalizer option. I had to play with that a small bit at first but if you don't have that option you should be good to go out of the box.Now for the part I hoped was on another level above buds, BASS. I'm a rap fan and, Idk why, but I gots to have my bass. Just what I like. And these beauties have got bass in buckets. The first time I wore them it kinda caught me by surprise. I had no idea how much bass I was getting. To compare it to the best buds I've owned would be like comparing Android to Apple, Android eviscerates an IPhone by a gigantic margin. Sound quality is a 9 and bass is an 11.I've rambled way too long. Look, if you wanna spend just a little bit more than the normal 25-50 bucks you usually spend on some type of headphone and you are a simple person that just needs a dependable long lasting product with pretty good sound quality plus you have had it with nasty earbud falling out of your ear, getting plugged with earwax(don't act like it doesn't happen to you, you ain't gotta lie to kick it) then please I implore you to spend a few more bucks on something you will instantly love and will have for many many years. These headphones are the answer. The perfect answer to your problem. The last headphones you will buy for 10 years or more. I absolutely was not gonna spend basically $200 for this. No way. But I finally did it and I can't describe how furious I'd be if I had been cheap again. I spend a lot of money a year on headphones, but that has been solved. You should also solve your problem, buy this pair of headphones. You can thank me when you write your 5 star review on Amazon. Lol. Enjoy. Thanks for reading this insane review. Peace.
I looove these headphones so much. I got them like right after I tried my friends pair on and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. The battery lasts so long and the noise quality is amazing. I also like that they adjust and they don‚Äôt fall off when I‚Äôm doing stuff around my house
I had a pair of M40x's before and ended up buying a 3rd party Bluetooth adapter for my commute. Worked great for almost 2 years until they broke. Saw the Bluetooth version for the M50x and had to try it.Oohh wweee these sound nice! What a nice upgrade! I didn't notice that these have Qualcomm aptX audio chips in them until I got it. So you get true HD 3D Surround Sound. I have an LG V40 and it has DTS:X 3D Surround Sound/Hi-Fi Quad DAC and it makes AAC lossless and WAV files sound amazing. I listen to heavy metal, deathcore, hip hop, r&b, rap, house, drum and bass, you name it and it ALL can sound amazing with the right adjustments and enabling those features. I love the optional 3.5mm audio cord that comes with it. Can use it on my Switch and other devices so the headphones become very versatile.The app kinda sucks on Android. You need location services and Bluetooth enabled for it to work IF it decides to even open. And then find your headphones... Takes about 10 tries. But when it does open, it can be useful to adjust numerous EQ settings and configuration.The battery is fantastic! I spend about 2.5 hours a day commuting on the train and I can go about 40 to 60 hours without charging these! However for some reason the headphones will report to my phone that it is almost dead about 80% of the time. Yet I can go 60 hours without charging? Not sure what's going on there but not an issue for me really since it will say "BATTERY LOW" when they are actually dying (you have 10 to 15 minutes left). A plus is even if the headphones are dead, you can use the 3.5mm audio cord that comes with it. Another note about Bluetooth is the mic: sometimes when you are listening to music and answer a call, the Bluetooth mic won't work unless you switch your call mode (Bluetooth to speaker and back to Bluetooth as an example). Rarely does it happen, but annoying when your boss calls you...The headband is comfortable and can be worn for a long time. However I am not a fan of how firm the cups are, so I usually buy third party foam cups that are a little softer. And they do a better job at noise cancellation in my opinion. I take the train so the noise cancellation is about 80+/-% stock, but with 3rd party foam cups I would say it goes to 90+/-% since these are passive noise cancellation (active is like Bose where there is a switch).Overall, I love these headphones so far even with the slight issues it has. They feel well built and the sound quality is superior. Replace the foam cups with something more comfortable and these will do the trick. If you have a device that has DTS:X or Hi-Fi Quad DAC then I highly recommend these to get the best music/sound experience. I wish I could give it 4.5/5 stars but I gotta give it the lower end due to the rare mic issue, battery status issue and the foam cups. 4/5Pros:-long battery life (40 to 60 hours)-superior sound-comfortable (stock: 8/10 can be 10/10)-optional 3.5mm audio cable-3D surround sound ready (DTS:X and Hi-Fi Quad DAC)-Qualcomm aptX chips (True AAC and WAV)-great passive noise cancellation with 3rd party cupsCons:-foam cups can be uncomfortable for some. I recommend 3rd party ones that are softer.-stock foam cups do an OK job at noise cancellation-the audio technica app gets 2.5/5 stars...-battery reporting status to Android Bluetooth 5.0 is funky-Bluetooth Mic is OK. Doesn't work on some calls and requires switching call modes. Rarely does this happen but annoying when it does.
The ATH-m50xBT is Good for music however they are really quiet. I usually have to turn the volume around 60-70 percent for it to sound perfect to me. These headphones have a relatively flat sound signature meaning that the small details in music sound very clear and is excellent for music production. The m50xBT and m50x are uncomfy when you first buy them but I would not recommend replacing the ear pads because they change the sound quality. The stock ear pads also get A LOT more comfy after the first week or two however they still feel terrible if you wear glasses and use these headphones for over 2-3 hours. If you hate audio bleed then I would suggest looking for new ear pads because if I turn the volume around 60-70 percent there is a small bit of audio bleeding. I also use these headphones for light gaming and listening to music 2-3 hours everyday, and these headphones are not the best for gaming but they are fine. When I hear footsteps and gunshots I can easily locate where a player is just as good or better than my opponent sometimes. The bluetooth is great, it doesn't have a lot of latency but the latency is not good enough to use the bluetooth mode for gaming. The only issue I have with bluetooth is that sometimes connecting the headphones to my Macbook air is very difficult. It wont connect sometimes forcing me to restart my computer. I would say this issue happens 5% of the time and I still don't know if it is something wrong with my headphones or laptop.if you don't want to read my essay:Cons:1.) A bit quiet.2.) sometimes the bluetooth does not connect to my Macbook properly.3.) Has a bit of audio bleeding4.) Uncomfy on the first week or twoPros:1.) sound great2.) not the best but is good for gaming3.) impressive sound isolation even though they don't have ANC (noise canceling)4.) The bluetooth does not have a lot of latency5.) bluetooth sounds similar to wired6.) Build quality is good, these will last you a long time as long as you don't throw them on the ground like a baseball everydayOverall: Good pair of headphones with a flat sound flat sound signature. Isolates sound pretty well and is comfy after the first week or two. Bluetooth works flawlessly (most of the time) without much latency.
As an audio enthusiast, I fell in love with Audio-Technica's budget friendly line of products around 10 years ago... Right before the hype was starting. I'm going to preface this and say that without a doubt, for casual and professional "listening" or "general recording" these will not disappoint whatsoever. Keeping in mind that they're slightly cut at the 200hz-300hz level and boosted at the lower frequencies, this will count the most for those looking to record. If you're a casual listener or general audio enthusiast, you can skip this next part.For monitoring audio, there is "relatively accurate" credibility to the claim that the ATH-M40Xs are the superior headphone. For casual listening, there is very little. There is absolute credit to be given for the 40s having a flatter response and without a doubt more neutral flavor. You can feel it in the soundstage as well - I owned a pair of M40x for 3 years and handled them roughly before they finally snapped at one of the earcup hinges (the actual plastic.) I can remember turning my head in surprise a bit more when listening to hi-Fi audio where subtle changes led to dynamic frequency shifts and would grade their "soundstage" at a 9/10. However, their 40mm drivers always, always, always lacked bass unless plugged into a headphone amp. Their construction is slightly less robust and they are generally less comfortable.Are there times I miss my M40xs? Absolutely. Generally the particular cut at the 300hz frequency of the M50x will eventually lead you to those pieces of audio that you wish it was more neutral in that range - and that range alone. Would I ever go back? Yes, but not over the M50x. Best analogy I could find is ordering an amasing cut of prime steak and asking it to be prepared medium. You have an amazing dinner and think "Wow, what a great steak!" And people yell "You should have gotten it medium rare!!" True "steak aficionados" all agree. Yet no one ordering the cut "medium" has any complaints. Let me give you some.ATH-M50x Bass Presence > 40xATH-M50x Natural Sound Isolation>ATH-M50x Comfort > M40xM50x's 45mm Drivers > 40mm DriversM50x Style> M40x StyleM50x Popularity/3rd Party Accessories>M40xFinally...Finally here we are. $100 for a pair of black M40x or $120 for a pair of blue/black M50x?Blue/black Audio Technica M50x all the way. The wonderful anodized blue and black paint over the hardened quality plastic is also awesome. Clamped them around the box the first night, and fall asleep with them on ever since night 2. Take them off at some point while asleep and toss em wherever. Not a scratch. Earcups get a little warm after a few hours. Hardly noticeable. Wearing them right now with no music on due to the natural sound isolation. Impedence or frequency EQ generally has me listening at 50% volume whereas the M40x I was always pushing 80% just to feel the bass a little. Great pair of natural headphones, but they're not better than the M50x's at $120

Every now and then, a product comes along that is a shocker, in a good way. This is one.It's an un-pretentiously quiet item, just another headphone from a Japanese electronics giant trying to have a full line of products, right? NO!I was in the true custom high-end audio business for a looooong time up until it became too separated from the next tier of gear. That last 1% performance should not cost 10-30 times as much money. One of my favorite record players (my specialty) jumped from $750 to $2500 with an inferior tonearm and motor and I realized I could not justify staying in the business.I've owned great midrange headphones that qualified at their time as "audiophile on a budget" phones, generally in the $200-300 range, real dollars, starting with AKG 240's, the originals, not the later sloppy versions, Sennheiser 430s, very silky, and even Koss Pro4AAA before that. Later got into Beyer and had several models, including the astonishingly accurate and detailed 880, the lush 990 and the slammin 770, and Grado 225s. They were all great in their way, and for the money, should have been. While not in the performance range of RS1s or other superlux reference phones, they were far better than most speakers at any price range could do, and my hifi's topped out at about a $35,000 system of all handmade stuff before I realized that it was getting silly.THIS JVC HARX-900 headphone proves that with some care, the first few dollars does the lion's share of the work, and that great value can be brought to the market if you don't waste money on bragging at how good a job you did saving money, only to burn it in ads.This is a VERY good compromise headphone for the person who can hear, has taste, and a limited budget. Solidly made, comfortable (even with glasses on my big head), they are a tad heavy compared to those elite models, like the 880s. However, for a sealed, true circumaural design, that is, they go AROUND the complete ear, soft and cushy, and do block outside noise okay, as well as keeping it in, these are a bargain. The head cushion is soft and large. The fitting is easy, you can reduce the pressure with a simple gentle bending of the bar across the top.Here is where money was saved, first: Pleatherette, for the look and feel of genuine naugahide, is what the earcups are cushioned in. Gonna get a bit sweaty in a hot room, but that's how it is with nearly every brand. Like most under $300 cans, the cups are plastic, though there is a metal outer cap. The gauge of plastics is pretty decent, though, so I don't anticipate breakage.Also, the cable is hard-wired (boo) and single sided (boo) making it weigh more on the left than the right. It is, though, a pretty thick cable so it probably has some fiber wound in it to make it hard to break. If I know JVC (Victor Corp of Japan) as I think I do, the wire itself is probably pretty schmancy in these and they just don't say anything about it. Uselessly, they gold plate the plug, which does come with a very snug fitting 1/4" adapter for regular hifi gear. Gold plating is a scam and is not the best choice for sound, but it's hard to undo decades of marketing hype. Ask Stereophile mag: they agree.I listen to all sorts of music. Out of the package brandy-new, these things were "meh." Yep, "meh." They were taut, almost raggedy with weird punchless low end. The highs were grainy but not annoying or harsh. They just didn't sound "nice." However, I've broken in hundreds of headphones and speakers for clients, and frankly, everything sounds crappy out of the package. Everything.What a difference 24 hours of continuous fairly loud hip-hop made!!!! The low end is much more articulate without feeling as "held back," lemme tell you, the people who've reviewed these after a hundred hours of break-in, I can see why they talk about huge bass response, and could hear it coming on, and the highs were sweeter and the mids much smoother. There is definitely a noticeable improvement in articulation with even this relatively short break-in.I just leave them cranking overnight, cups pushed together with a rubber band, on a hip-hop station with the loudness on, the bass turned up and the volume well below any dangerous distorting from either the amp (an HK: VFETs to the headphone jack) or drivers.Every day, they sound better: the telling thing is that they sound less "loud." At the same volume. This is a phenomenon that really good speakers exhibit, and phones: the distortion levels drop so low that they don't seem "loud." But they are.There is really no major coloration to these, so far, though I can sense that a bit of a "warm" sound is coming on, which makes sense with this kind of break-in. I'm a bass player. I can live with that... heheheh.Other than getting a steal on a used set of properly broken in higher end phones, this is the absolutely best sounding overall under $100 pair of headphones new that I have ever heard, and yeah, that includes some well-loved AT models.This is a stupidly awesome bargain, efficient (only 64 ohms, plays great on my iPod), and looks "perfeshinul," so you'll be stylin' in 'em, too, if you wear them out on the go.GREAT FIRST EXPOSURE TO REAL AUDIO. Buy these before you try to buy good speakers. Trust me, just do it so you can hear what's wrong with most speakers more easily. Just do it. Now.
Just wow. These headphones are great. to start off, they were shipped in a standard sized box, filled with those big air bags to keep it safe. It came to me undamaged, and the inner box didn't have a scratch on it, so shipping was flawless. Opening the headphone box itself, really easy as they don't use the nuclear warfare-safe plastic on it. The headphones come with a 1/4'' plug-on for plugging into heavy stereo equipment, as well as the standard 1/8'' jack for computer, or mobile use. Now, for the product itself.First off, the sturdiness and structural feel of these headphones seem good. Everything is basically plastic, but thicker and stronger, it feels as if it can take quite a beating (even though it will never receive one from me!), and the metal sliders for it to adjust for your head as solid, again, doesn't feel like it will wear out anytime soon. the hinges for the cups to come inward are also quite solid. I'd give the structure a 5 outta 5 stars.Second, the comfort of the headphones. I've already worn them for very long gaming sessions (approximately 5~7 hours at a time since I've had them), and they don't hurt my head at all. They are rather heavy compared to most headphones, but the top of the headphones makes up for this, as the top is very comfortable, stretchy and foamy to the touch. My only complaint with the cups themselves is that they are leatherette, which, in the heat of the summer, causes my ears to sweat. This can get a little uncomfortable, but it's not so much that they detract from any gaming experiences I may have, and it doesn't get so hot that I have to take them off. I give the comfort of these headphones a 4 out of 5 stars.Third, and arguably the most important, the audio. Having 50mm Neo magnets, I expected great bass and sound immersion out of these headphones, and they eventually delivered. These headphones are like a fine wine, they need to age properly before you really get their flavour. Right out of the box, the bass sounded muffled, and the treble was very tinny, the mids were kinda just there. I let them sit with dubstep blasting into them for about 12 hours, and it was a big turn about. The bass became a lot more boomy, the mids were more noticeable (we'll get back to mids in a bit) and the treble was much clearer. As I've burned them in more and more, they only get better and better. Don't be discouraged about these headphones right out of the box, I will admit that I was disappointed with the sound at first when I first got them. But after a few days of burn-in they sound completely different, and for the best. At their peak, bass is incredible (almost too much bass, but like the mids we will get back to it), mids are clear and treble is defined, making the sound quality of these headphones amazing, especially for the price you pay. Also, for gamers out there that want these for FPS, these headphones have excellent directionality, you can hear the slightest rustle in the bushes from behind.  I'd give sound quality a 5 out of 5 stars.Lastly, and completely optional, is the modding aspect of these headphones. WARNING, MODDING THEM WILL VOID ANY AND ALL WARRANTY, ONCE YOU MOD THEM, YOU CAN'T RETURN THEM. With that said, this headset (you'll see why I changed to calling them that in a second) are big, allowing for all kinds of wonderful  mods. Personally, I have already modded mine so that they have a boom mic at the base of the left cup, right next to where the wire comes out. With the amount of room inside these cups, you can also give them a different sound, with some dynamat (or fatmat if you're cheap like I am). This allows for the almost overwhelming bass to be quelled a bit, while heightening the mids and highs. There are many forums on modding these headphones, so far I've checked out Head-fi.org and overclock. net, but there are more still. These headphones have versatility, and I love that, as I am a huge fan of tinkering. Plus, if they break, I can usually fix them on my own, so no need for warranty. I'd give mod-ability a 5 out of 5 stars, though again, this is completely optional.I absolutely love this headset, and I hope to keep them for a very long time. I will put an update of how they are doing at around 6~8 months, so long as they do not break or malfunction between that time.
I was perusing the local electronics store one day and it dawned on me that I haven't have an adequate pair of headphones for quite some time. I used to have a set of Kenwood over-the-ear phones but the padding had long since been destroyed. So I decided to purchase a pair of affordable Sony noise reducing headphones. It was kind of an impulse buy. The Sony's are okay. They're not uncomfortable and they're great for portability, but sound wise, pretty mediocre, with no bass to offer at all. Not quite the full sound I want when listening to Creedence through my Harman Kardon receiver!I was determined to find some decent over-the-ear headphones at an affordable price as I'm allergic to spending $100 on a pair of headphones. The trick is also finding a pair comfortable for me. I have rather large ears that stick out slightly (no, I'm not a Hobbit...I'm more Elf-ish) so the kind of headphones I prefer are also tend to make my ears sore after a while. So I needed an over-the-ear set of headphones that perform well, with decent bass, fit comfortably and are affordable. Too much to ask perhaps, but for those aspects I can sacrifice asthetics. They don't have to look pretty. Also, I'm no audio expert so it's okay if other brands are known to perform better, as long as the pair I choose still perform well.Thanks to the reviews from these good patrons of Amazon, I decided on the JVC HA-RX900. The RX700 also had great reviews but the softer ear pads gave these the edge. 5-stars to Amazon and the merchant for speedy delivery!LOOKS:The JVC's weren't much to look at on a computer screen, so I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box. They are fairly attractive upon closer view. I like the black/dark gray colors. There's little vents around the outside of the earpieces to allow some of the sound out. So they're semi-open...or semi closed...not sure. I'm also not sure what the benefit is, but it looks pretty cool. There's a subtlety to the design of these headphones I like very much.FEEL:The JVC's are large and seem well constructed. Yet they are also lightweight, at least for their size. They feel good around my head, thanks to the very soft ear pads. There's been no soreness from my ears, which is a relief. I'm trying to get used to the pressure overall from the both the mesh head-piece and the ear-pieces. It's been quite a while since I had headphones like this. But they are far and away easier on me than those old Kenwood's were. The JVC's will stay on your head too. No way these babies are falling off while jamming out to some classic rock.SOUND:Man, these do sound good! I read somewhere that they sound better after about 80 hours of use. I'll have to take their word for it because I have no intention of counting those hours. All I know is they sound terrific now! The bass is perfect. I half expected heavier bass from some reviews I read online, but the bass is neither too much, nor too little. All other audio aspects are excellent too. My Harman Kardon has a "Dolby Headphone" setting (or DH), which works nicely off 5.1 surround sound-based material (such as a DVD connected through a digital audio cable). But when listening to a CD, I find it best to play through normal stereo cables while switching off the DH setting (and on to BP for the "Bypass" setting) on my receiver for a more conventional stereo effect. In fact, it's spectacular. Usually, when I play Creedence's "Born on the Bayou", I barely notice the clapping that joins in at the beginning. With these headphones, set to BP through stereo cables, the clapping is just as clear as the bass, drums and guitar, as well as the cowbell which comes later in the song. To top it off, John Fogerty's roar is as powerful as ever! In other words, it passes the Creedence test! I also turned my cable onto some "Throwback Jamz" under the 5.1-supported DH setting to test the bass for good measure (what better way to test bass than to go old school hip hop?) and was delighted by the deep booms.So I'm thrilled with the JVC HA-RX900! Who knows? Perhaps on the 81st hour, I'll say, "Hold on a minute, NOW it's awesome! All those other hours were crap compared to this!"
I've owned two other sets of headphones: Bose quietcomfort 15, sony md6 v6. These JVCs can hold their own to both - but you need to mod them first (see below). They just have different uses. I like the QC15 for flights (noise cancellation excellent but adds distortion), HARX900 for home / office (good sound and very comfortable but very clunky), V6 for on-the-go (best all-round phones - small, excellent sound, less comfortable than HARX900). If you've never owned a decent set of phones, buy these, mod them, then relisten to some of your favorites on cd or a high bit-rate source (spotify, not youtube). You'll think that it's a different recording, you hear so much more detail.Pros:+Excellent large driver with strong punchy bass - great for hip hop, EDM, top 40, anything with lots of bass+Decent highs and mids once you mod them (see below)+Extremely comfortable, wearable for many, many hours on end (I think I've worn these for 6 hours without even noticing them. Suffice it to say I get sick of listening to music much sooner than these get uncomfortable)+"Closed" so you won't bother your neighbors as much as open headphonesCons:-Needs to be modded (only tool required is a small flathead screwdriver) to unleash full potential-A little unbalanced - I've noticed that the headphones have slightly different response at different frequencies. How do I know?[...]The sound should be right down the middle for all frequencies. With these, I noticed the sound moves left and right depending on the frequency. Not a big deal for me, since these are cheap headphones, and you're still getting excellent drivers even if they are a little inconsistent.***MOD INSTRUCTIONS (you will not regret this - I'm 99% sure)***The phones have a felt filter that blocks out all the higher mids and highs. It's really easy to remove, all you need is a screw driver.Just take off the soft ear cups, you'll see a plastic guard with 2 screws. Take off the screws and the plastic guard and discard them. Behind the plastic guard you will see a layer of felt glued on. Scratch as much as you can off. I used a sharp kitchen knife. Poke holes through the felt so that the air can travel from the driver directly to your human sound receptors (aka ears). Be VERY CAREFUL you only poke through the felt, do not damage the driver that is right behind it. I might suggest using a pen or a sharpened pencil, because the width of the pen or pencil will prevent you from damaging the driver. The more felt you can scratch off, the better your phones will sound.Once you're done scratching as much as you can, put the cups back on. Et voila - $200 headphones for $50 and 5 minutes of your time. I forgot to do this but I should have scratched one side, then do a sound test before scratching the other, to really appreciate the mod. I did both at the same time before testing them again, but you'll really get to appreciate your work if you do one side first, do a sound test, then the other side. Once you scratch off the felt, the highs are much, much better - not more felt blocking the air flow! Try listening to some high female vocals - bliss.I have no idea why Panasonic would ruin such a sweet sounding set of phones by adding this crap in front of the driver - maybe they were trying to please low bit-rate listeners by softening the ugly digital sounds in the highs that you get with lower bit rate samples, or maybe they were going after bass music listeners (hip hop? EDM? trolls who buy dre beats headphones? I hope you didn't by dre beats, they're just $40 phones distorted to hell + $20 of marketing that they sell you for $200)Hands down the best sound $60 can buy. These aren't quite the sony's - those are studio monitor quality. But for first timers, they're a HUGE upgrade from any sub-$60 phones you may already have, and definitely an upgrade from desktop speakers. You won't believe the crap you were listening to before!
Short version--------------Zero buyer's remorse.  Spend the extra $20 and spring for the 900s over the 700s!Longer version---------------When it comes to major purchases, I'm picky and I do my homework.  I spent days scouring websites, reviews and forum posts looking for a decent set of headphones that sounded great but wouldn't break the bank.  These headphones have earned a lot of praise around the interwebs and I was curious to see if they deserved it.  Do they?  I think so.  Let's break it down.Design-------First off, the reason everyone says these things are big is because they're freakishly, borderline comically, large.  You'll get accustomed to them soon enough though.  Luckily they're much, much lighter than they look.  And they're comfy too.  The head pad thing is really soft, as are the earcups.  As for fit, I've got a largish head and largish ears that stick out a bit, and they fit just fine.  The cups fit comfortably around my ears without being too snug in any way.  The headphones stay in place without crushing your ears or skull, which is always a plus.  They do get slightly warm after prolonged use, which is normal for around-the-ear headphones, but never uncomfortably so.  They seal out and keep in sound well enough.  Overall they're comfortable and sturdy, and they look pretty slick to boot.Performance------------Subjectively, I really like the way these things sound.  They've got a rich, detailed, full, and wide sound that works well with any genre.  They sounded great with everything I threw at them: Beethoven, Daft Punk, Andrew Bird, Killers, Kanye, Muse.  These things have a good deal of bass that bumps but doesn't overpower the mids or highs.  If you're coming from a cheap pair of headphones, you'll hear details you've never heard before.  And if you're listening to low-quality mp3s with bitrates lower than 192kbps, you'll probably hear details you wish you didn't.  Considering these headphones cost around $50, I simply have no complaints in sound quality.Note about "burn-in": If you've spent time researching headphones, you've probably come across this term.  It's basically a break-in period wherein you play either a tone or music at a louder-than-normal listening volume for a period of time to achieve a broken-in sound sooner; some people swear it improves sound quality and others think it's hogwash.  I was leaning towards the latter but decided to give it a try anyway.  After around 30hrs of discontinuous break-in, I honestly didn't notice a difference. Whether or not the sound actually changed, they sound great now.HA-RX700 vs HA-RX900-------------------Like me, it seems a lot of people are on the fence about which pair to pick up.  I decided to order both pairs of headphones and see how they compare.  They look about the same, save the higher-quality materials used in the 900s' headband and earcups and the addition of a plastic-y mesh ring.  The 900s definitely get the nod in comfort and styling, but it's not a landslide.  But in terms of performance, it is. I've read so many forum posts and reviews claiming that the 700s sound more clear and balanced.  As you'll recall, I described the sound of the 900s as rich, full, and wide with bass that bumps but doesn't overpower.  The 700s have none of these qualities.  What other customers describe as clear and balanced comes across as cold, bland, and narrow when compared with the 900s.  In a rapid-fire comparison of switching between both headphones during various songs in various genres, I preferred the 700s exactly zero percent of the time.  There just was no comparison.  This comparative lifelessness was the reason I returned the 700s and kept the 900s.  I'd recommend saving a step and getting the 900s straight away.Conclusion-----------Pros: Sound quality, comfort, build quality, styling, priceCons: Size (wear them indoors), cable length (use a twist tie)These headphones sound great, feel great, and look great, all for a reasonable price.  I was not disappointed.Leave your questions in the comments and I'll be glad to respond to them!
I have owned the HARX700's for around 3 years and absolutely loved them to bits. I'm a big fan of the JVC sound, having previously been a strict Sennheiser customer for many years previously. However, I switched to JVC when money was tighter and have not looked back.My HARX700's are still in working order, however the ear pads have started to degrade and split. I could probably replace them, but for the cost of the headphones I feel 3 years was a good return on investment. I almost just purchased another pair, but decided to spend a little extra and try the HARX900's instead.I use headphones connected to a laptop via a Cambridge DAC. I also "burned in" the headphones for a few hours before judging them as this absolutely does make a slight difference, in my opinion.At first listen I was underwhelmed by the HARX900's. They sounded a little flat and lacking in "energy". However, the more I listened, the more I started to warm to them. I could tell they were definitely a little more subtle than the 700's, but still felt they just weren't as exciting sounding. So having listened to them for a few hours it was time to try a side-by-side listen. I used Lana Del Rey's most recent album as a test.Switching to the 700's I was immediately hit by how much more the midrange punched, and how much deeper the bass was. The sound was more full-bodied and engaging. Then I realized that was more down to the fact I was so used to the 700s - like a favorite old sweater. The bass on the 700's is deeper than the 900's, but is also less controlled. It's almost like having a bass boost button turned on. It sounds a bit artificial after getting used to the 900's. Similarly, the midrange on the 700's stands out, but it lacks a little of the detail and separation you get with the 900's. Essentially, the 900's are more accurate across the whole range of sound, whereas the 700's are more dynamic sounding at the expense of a little subtlety.I still love the 700's. If I listened to mainly modern pop/dance music I think they would be the better choice. However, the 900's are definitely better across the whole range of music types. I would also say the differences I'm talking about are NOT night and day here. The 700's are still mighty impressive for the money, but the 900's ultimately offer that bit more accuracy in music that demands it.
Coming from the Audeze LCD-X 2021, Sennheiser HD 8XX, Focal Elegia and other high-end headphones, these look and feel like $200 headphones; really nice build quality and fit and finish. The sound, however, is not very good. Bass is flabby and bleeds into the muddy mids. The highs are muffled. Subtractive EQ doesn't do much to fix them.The drivers just do not have much potential. Don't get me wrong: they sound acceptable. They're enjoyable and do the job, but do not expect much clarity or separation. I wouldn't buy then again for music.For over half the price, the Superlux HD-668B (about $28) are amazing, and the HD-681 (about $19) too. Those really sound impressive regardless of price. I got mine from Thomann Music.
I got these headphones because I wanted better audio quality and more noise reduction, on those fronts I was totally satisfied.  What I did not realize, however, is that these headphones are not really geared for listening on the go.  The cord is VERY long.  It is also a thick sturdy gauge, which means it won't likely break and doesn't tangle easily, however, that it's length is magnified when you bundle it.  The cord was so long that I had to bundle off several feet of it which makes for a bundle about 4"x2"x1", which is rather large, big enough that I just put a carabineer on it and attach it to my belt loop so it doesn't make my pockets bulge.The long cord could definitely be a major PRO if you plan to use it in some sort of music studio, your computer, or basically anywhere that you won't be traveling around.  When I've wanted to do that, it has been really nice to not need an extension, but for my needs it was excessive.Next, these are a serious set of cans.  The ear pieces, while VERY comfortable, are LARGE.  They're about 4.5" in diameter and about 2" deep, meaning they stick off your head about 2".  Not a big deal if you wear them in a sedentary setting, but moving around they can be a tab bulky, or if you listen to music napping/sleeping like me, a little too big.  Or if you like to let your headphones rest on your shoulders when not in use, like I do, they're about as big as my next and thus it feels like a neck brace when I do, instead I've taken to just letting them rest on my head about my ears.Overall I still really like the headphones, despite their size and excessive cording.  The fact that I do travel with them a fair amount is a testament to their durability as they still look pretty new, despite getting banged around and stuff.  The cord that goes across the top makes for a decent carry handle, and I often clip the carabineer that I hooked to the cord bundle to the top of the headset and then I can clip the headphones to my bag or wherever.I'm not a true audiophile that can give detailed explanation of the sound quality, but I listen to all kinds of music from classical, to rock, hip-hop, pop, alternative, symphonic, movies, etc. really anything.  They have far superior quality to any other headphones I've used, except maybe some true noise canceling top of the line Bose, but FAR better than Beats for far less, and better durability.  The bass is good, and the sound rich and deep, not just loud.
To start, this headphone is better than I could of expected from any Pair under 150 Dollars.Bass:They have an excellent bass that can be a little heavy at times, but will satisfy most people.  It has a nice, punchy bass that does a fantastic job of not distorting any sounds.  These are the perfect headphone for a person into House/Club music, Dubstep, or Hip/Hop Rap.Comfort:I found astonishing comfort with these headphones.  They do get a little hot after a couple hours of use, but that is expected with any headphone that is not fully open.  They are also decently heavy because of the size.Sound stage:These have a superb sound stage compared to any headphone of this price.  They do sound a little flat with some music but after burn-in time you will notice they begin to create a wider sound stage.  They do lean towards a more dynamic sound, but open up as you burn them in.Burn-In Period:You will notice a massive difference after just 20-40 hours of burn in time.  You will notice a heavier, punchier bass, The mids and highs will be brighter, and the vocals with sound MUCH crisper.  I have probably burned these in for 100 + hours by now, and they have hit their real peak of perfection.There are however a few, not very noticeable cons:They are not perfect for movies or shows because they are not the most natural sounding headphone.  They have a more dynamic sound... which is better for music.  The highs can get screechy at times, but there are a few mods you can do to almost eliminate this problem.My older brother does own a pair of Sennheiser HD 558's.  They are a fantastic pair of headphones.  But to be honest, if i had to chose between those ($180) and these ($60) i would pick these.  The value on these JVC's are just incredible.Looks:These may not be the prettiest, most stylish headphones in the world.  But then again, they are not really created to be a stylish kind of headphone like Beats (Which are ONLY for people looking for tons of bass), or Skullcandy's (Which by the way are also not the best headphone company).  They are VERY BIG headphones.Build Quality:I call these my little hulks.  These are probably the most durable headphones I've owned.  They also have very soft, squishy ear pads that provide out-of-this-world comfort.All in All, these are the BEST headphones you will find under 100 dollars by FAR.  You will notice things in your music you have never heard before, you will smile when a great song comes on that you love.  I hope you found this review to be helpful!
I'm going to differ with the many glowing reviews here, and say that these JVC headphones are almost unbearable right out of the box, but can easily be modified to be very good.The problem is JVC's inclusion of what they call an "acoustic lens", which is nothing more than a thick layer of dense felt, anchored over the drivers with glue and a piece of plastic which also covers the drivers.  The result is a frequency response that kills high frequencies and mids, leaving a tubby, slow, and overwhelming bass.  Yucch.  I couldn't find a single recording that sounded good.I noted in some of the reviews that there were popular modifications to these phones, so I went to a well known headphone hobbyist site, head-fi.org, and found a wonderful thread detailing how to go about these mods.  http://www.head-fi.org/t/381303/jvc-ha-rx900-modifications-a-picture-tutorial-56k-forget-about-itBasically, the thread's author detailed three mods:  1) removal of the felt and "acoustic lens" from the drivers.  2) addition of a tiny amount of speaker stuffing to the back of the driver cup to tame the bass response, and 3) the application of "Dynamat" to the driver cup to damp vibration.I skipped the Dynamat since I had none and didn't feel like spending $20 on a set of phones I was feeling dubious about.  I did the other two mods, however, and was rewarded with a huge improvement....turned a one star product into a four star, IMHO.When removing the felt, be aware that the actual driver is well protected under its own metal grill of sorts, but that you still need to poke the felt out of all those little holes in the driver's grill cover, so be VERY careful poking that you don't poke too deep and puncture the driver cone.  Take your time and use good lighting.  I used the same tiny Phillips screwdriver that I had used to remove the screws to poke out the felt from the holes.I used "Acoustica-Stuff" to do the fiber fill behind the drivers, any similar stuff will do.  First try I used too much and cut the bass too much.  I tried again, using half as much, and was met with great success.  The bass tightened, pitch became clearer, and the boominess was gone.  I ended up with a VERY thin layer of the stuff, you could see through it to the black plastic cup behind it in spots.BREAK-IN is always important with mechanical audio gear, like speaker drivers.  Drivers are made of flexible, springy things that move back and forth, and they are stiff at first.  I've never encountered a speaker (or headphone) that didn't change in sound after a few hours (sometimes many hours) of use.  Even after completing the mods, I let these play for another three days or so, and the sound continued to improve.  Detail has increased, while the overall presentation has smoothed.  Recordings that earlier had not been pleasant are now quite nice.These headphones are still not "giant killers", but for $62 and a half hour of mod work, they are a steal.  I like them much more than my $100 Grado e80is, which sound thin and toy like in comparison.  The JVCs have a warm, pleasing tonal balance now, strong low bass, clear mids and non fatiguing highs....post mods.  I may still do the Dynamat mods, but am so pleased with what I have that I may not bother.Also a word about comfort and fit:  These are very large headphones which fit my large head and ears very comfortably.  They're not for portable use.  The construction quality is quite good, too.If you're a tinkerer, go for it!

I gave them five stars because there‚Äôs nothing wrong with them. They are super cute and just as pictured! However, they barely fit my average sized third grader. Size would be appropriate for toddlers.
My granddaughter chose these Panda Headphones.  She loves pandas! She said they are so cute, comfortable, and has good sound.  Yes, it is adorable, well made, and the ear pieces are soft to the touch! She is able to wear it for at least an hour without her ears hurting or feeling uncomfortable. I would recommend these Panda Headphones because of the functionality, price, and kid approved!
My granddaughter loves these headphones.  I‚Äôve no idea about the noise cancelling these headphones provide. All I can say is that my 4 year old granddaughter loves them.
My granddaughter loves these as they block out the noise so she can focus on her school work and drown out the distractions.
Got these for the school year, kiddo brought them home a month later saying they just stopped working.
We ordered one pair as a Christmas gift and they stopped working within a month of having them. I attempted to contact seller and never heard back. Since they're not too expensive, I took a gamble and ordered a second pair hoping it was a fluke and these headphones are ADORABLE on my 6 year old oves pandas. But alas, they stopped working too.
This is the 3rd pair of headphones I bought for my daughter and the first pair that's actually lasted longer than a week. They're durable, cute & you can change the maximum volume setting. I accidentally stepped on them and they didn't break.
My daughter is surely enjoying her headsets.
We were excited to get these headphones as our daughter absolutely loves pandas. She's only 8 and even when these were adjusted they would barely fit her. She is a very petite 8 as well. Not that it really mattered as the headphones stopped working after about 5 months of use. I did consider buying another pair because: Panda headphones. But they really are more like junk. I did like that the volume on these are lower and can not be raised very high because this is for children and helps protect their ear drums.
My 3 year old granddaughter loves them. They are so cute  , and she said they work good. Well worth the money.

Let me start by saying I am an amateur audio enthusiast that loves a balanced and detailed sound signature.  I don't care about making phone calls or active noise cancellation (ANC).  For the most part, I wear headphones in quiet places to listen to music and ANC usually messes up the sound signature anyway.  Just give me good audio with passive noise isolation and I am satisfied.  Second, I don't care for the bloated bass you find in most consumer headphones.  Just let me hear what was recorded with clarity, detail, natural tonality, and a great sound stage.  I've spent a modest amount on DACs, amps, earphones, and headphones to deliver the kind of sound that makes you remember why you love music so much.But there are times when I just want to kick back and relax and not be tied down by wires.  My solution to date has been EarStudio's ES100 and a good pair of IEMs.  The AAC codec from an iPhone using high-quality music source (FLAC, Amazon Ultra HD) with high-end in-ear monitors sound reasonably close to my wired Drop HD6XX or Hifiman HE400i cans on my Schiit stack.  I had tried a few over-ear Bluetooth headphones but nothing has ever sounded even close to what I consider high quality audio.  Either too much bass or an ANC system that interfered with the audio signature (on or off).  Nothing met my amateur audiophile aspirations.That is until I got Sennheiser HD 350BT.  After reading a few of the reviews, I almost didn't order them.  But for under $100 I decided to take a chance.  From the first listen I was blown away by the balanced sound signature.  Not that far off from the Sennheiser house sound signature.  After 20+ hours of breaking them in, the bass has opened up just a little and the mids are still wonderfully natural and perfectly placed evenly in the mix.  And while these are not as good as a wired over-ear headphone on a high-quality dac/amp, for a wireless audio headphone solution these come close enough to free me from the wires and not feel like I am missing much.The bass is solid from sub-bass to mid-bass without muddying up the lower mids.  These are not consumer bass-head cans with bloated bass.  You can feel the thump of bass drums and toms on ears.  The bass is present way down into the frequency range, but there isn't an overpowering slam nor is it the star of the show.  But it is clean and surprisingly detailed.  And the sound app EQ settings, which is too simplistic, still let's you bump the bass some if you need a little more.  Listening to Marcus Miller on Laid Black is great for illustrating how well these handle the lower frequencies.  Miller's bass solos are a pure pleasure listen to.Mids are where many headphones fall short - either missing the natural sound of voices and instruments or placing them behind/under the bass and highs.  Yet this is where much of the audio is in most genres of music.  Voices, guitars, strings, woodwinds, brass, and snares/toms bring the bulk of audio that is to be heard.  The HD 350BT shines here.  Sennheiser really shows they know how to shape a balanced sound signature around high-quality mids.  Listening to Boney James on Future Soul I heard a natural and realistic alto sax sound that is so, so good.The highs are also very good and actually somewhat relaxed for Sennheiser.  I prefer just a little more air and sparkle, but even without EQ these are delightful.  However, using the very-basic EQ settings in the Sennheiser Sound Control app I was able to bump the highs to add exactly what I was looking for.  Cymbals and triangles ring clear and the detail and imaging provided is very good for Bluetooth wireless audio.  No distortion, sibilance, or feel of grainy treble.  You can hear small details of instrument decay, reverb, and echoes in the room.  Listening to the Marcin Wasilewski Trio with Joakim Miller on Spark of Life, I was able to hear the detailed clicks of drumsticks and subtle crash of cymbals of Michal Miskiewicz's excellent musicality on the drums in each song.But what I love best about the HD 350BT is the excellent dynamics and sound stage.  I'm not sure how Sennheiser worked their magic building a digital audio decoder and amp into a headphone that delivers such an excellent sound stage.  But I am very happy they did.  They sound equally good at low volume or high.  Overall dynamics from soft to loud is incredible for a wireless audio product.  The stage is wider than average with a good bit of depth and height.  They detail of the highs provided just enough air give that sense of spaciousness and realism I really enjoy.  It really put these over the top for me.Note that these are not the loudest headphones and to get these cranking they need to be in excess of 75% volume, which does not leave much room at the top end.  But given the excellent passive noise isolation, they are more than loud enough for most, even in a moderately loud environment.  The Sound Control App is marginally useful.  The EQ works, but is essentially a three-band equalizer that can be toggled between a hard to use visual representation or a linear hi/mid/low band setting that is easier to use.  I do wish that Sennheiser could have provided a 5 or 7 band EQ.  But as I said it works - just could be better.I also found the HD 350BT headphones to be very comfortable and can wear them for hours at a time with no discomfort.  That said, the ear pads are soft but somewhat small and could be problematic for someone with larger ears.  The build quality is solid despite the plastic material used for the majority of the body.  They also look great in black to me.  But don't expect frills, a case, or even a bag.  The focus at this price is on a great audio, not accessories.If you are more of an audio purist, love the natural sound signature/tonality of Sennheiser products and don't care about ANC, then these are a huge steal at under $100.  Forget the HD 450BT and it's ANC, get these instead.  And no need to spend $300 or more on Sony and Bose.  Spend your money on great audio.  These simply sound great!
The first time I left them on accidentally I was like oh no they're going to die! and then they didn't still for a long time. The second time I woke up and there was still music playing out of them which I'm sure was entirely my fault and even then they didn't die for a while. Now I leave them on without sound going and it's great. I also love how I can pair it to my phone and my laptop and it knows which one to pair to based on the sound output. So neat! Who knew headphones could be so great? What would I change... Maybe have the English woman who tells me it's pairing or whether I'm turning it off or on just talk to me randomly with some sort of AI like she's my friend and really likes this song or she's tired of listening to music can't we go for a silent walk or something like that why do you only want to hear what I have to say when you want to listen to music or watch television why can't we just be silent together and I'd say yes Senny, sorry Senny.
When I get a new album and I want to really hear every detail, these aren't the ones I use... I've got no way to connect these to my record player. I have my favorite  headphones for critical listening and I don't do that via Bluetooth.  These are the headphones I listen to while i'm making my morning coffee and my wife is still sleeping, or in a public place where I don't want to impose my music choices on people around me and I don't want to snag my cable on things when I move around. There is a time and a place for Bluetooth headphones, and that's actually a lot of times and places.These beat the crap out of all my wireless IEMs in terms of sound quality, which makes them the headphones I use most often because I don't usually want to be tethered to my amp. They work great for phone calls, and the sound is pretty good in all frequencies. I wouldn't say any part of the sound spectrum is  particularly outstanding or lacking... just adequate all around. I am happy to have these headphones.
So now having used these while at my work place for a while now (noisey environment), I have a few points on them (have had for less than 2 months):ProsGood battery lifeGood sound but a touch quiet in certain environmentsUsb C chargerConsI underestimated the control complexity(Each function is a separate button essentially)Tight squeeze fit for medium to larger heads until broke in but still tighter fit.Probably other stuff I'm forgetting currently.I wouldn't buy them again due to the controls only.
Decent headset for the price
No headphone jack. If you care about an important feature like a headphone jack, I wouldn't recommend this product. The app kinda sucks too, don't update the headphone firmware and you will be fine. Other than that it gets a 3.5/5 for me cause the battery life is great. I can go a few days to a week without charging and I use it to listen to music everyday to and from school on the bus and studying. the Sound Quality is alright, not top tier but not bad either for bluetooth headphones, above average I would say, hence the 4/5 on the sound quality. As for noise cancelling, I don't know much about it as I don't really notice it, but I can hear more of my music vs the cars passing by walking down the sidewalk. so I gave that department a 3/5
I have very sensitive ears and usually have to take of headphones - even in case when they are over ears but press some part of my ear to head. These headphones are real over-ear and I can train in them for 2 hours non-stop. Noise cancellation is about 80-90% but It's what I need to at least keep track of what happening around me. The noise that gets through is low and doesn't bother or interrupt my training. Love it!
Comfort and build: comfort is lousy because the cups are too small.  I can't wear them for too long because my ears will get sore.  If they were just slightly larger this would not be an issue.  My ears are not that large, so unless you have small ears this might be an issue.  The button layout is terrible, too many similar buttons and the power button is hard to reach.  Build wise, it is all plastic but feels well designed and durable.Noise cancelling: THIS DOESN'T HAVE IT!  There are so many trash reviews right now.  Look the 450 model has ANC, the 350 model does not.  Don't be fooled by those bad reviews.  I intentionally bought this model over the 450 because from experience I know that Sennheiser does not do good ANC.  Sony and Bose are where you look.Sound quality: above average for wireless headphones.  The bass is muddy and never impactful.  The mids are overly recessed and the treble is too much.  It gives the headphones a dull, thin sound.  A bit of an exaggeration but it is like listening to AM radio.  It is NOT at all the Sennheiser house sound (rich warm, dark and highly detailed).  It is also not terribly detailed.  But it is better than most wireless headphones that have that consumer-grade sound of incredibly flabby, muddy mid and upper bass boost.  The best I've heard are from Beyerdynamics, AKG and Audio-Technica but their offerings are much more expensive or lacking in features or are poorly made.Comparison to the 4.40: this headphone is the spiritual successor to the 4.40.  The 4.40 was a terrible headphone.  It had an audible noise floor (I listen to classical music at low to mid-volume so the hiss was always present).  It had poor support for codecs and did not have much in the way of volume or dynamics.  Finally, the 4.40 took micro-usb for charging.  This headphone is much better.  Sennheiser clearly redesigned their wireless headphone.  There is no noise floor on the 350.  It supports nearly every codec you can think of.  It uses bluetooth 5.0 and has usb-c with fast charging.Verdict: at $100 you can't do any better.  It has the best sound quality, build and features at that price point and comes from a name brand.  Notice I didn't praise it to the moon.  Temper your expectations.  It is impossible to find great SQ or great NC on wireless headphones without setting a pretty steep budget.  And there are no wireless headphones that hit both out of the park.  It is unfortunate that Sony and Bose have such great ANC but such lousy SQ, and all audiophile brands put so much effort into SQ but almost no effort into NC.
There are few aptx-LL or low-latency capable headphones on market (the newer Bluetooth 5.3 standard might change this situation?). This one works without connectivity issue, with basic app support for firmware update.My only complaint is the size of buttons and LED, too tiny for my parents who use this to watch TV.
I bought a pre-Bluetooth set of wireless Sennheisers TR120 years ago.  They lasted a long time, were very comfortable.  With new computers, I bought my first set of Bluetooths last month.  They suffer from fingernail-on-the-blackboard cutouts due to interference of the type described all over the web.  I'm  cleared to return them and will replace with a set of wire phones.  These fold up and are less comfortable than the 120s were, to boot.  Anyway if you know Bluetooth will work for you go for it.  And Sennheiser makes quality products.

They work great and mostly noise cancel. They have good sound quality
Really happy with these. Use them as my daily gym headphones. Good sound quality, good bass, solid noise cancellation, and the battery life is incredible, like almost unbelievable. They‚Äôre physically a bit large, but would totally buy them again. The controls on the side are really convenient.
I love most genres of metal ranging from Metallica to August Burns Red to Motionless in White to Orbit Culture. Super heavy, deep bass is AMAZING and technical riffs/solos sounds incredible.Microphone works very well. Used for school and everyone could hear me no problem.Surround sound is pretty good, I‚Äôm no expert on noise canceling but I could imagine noise canceling being better quality, but you‚Äôre paying less than $200 for a great set of over-the-ear headphones!Can‚Äôt expect the same quality in $175 headphones that you get with $500 sets.
As a regular headset, it is fantastic. Excellent bass sound as advertised. Microphone arrays pickup crystal-clear voice for Zoom meeting, phone, etc.  Quality Sony product (I had several Sony high-end headsets in the past). But I am somewhat disappointed with the noise cancelling performance, which is the main reason it was purchased. There is a button that one can toggle through 3 modes: ambient sound (AS), ambient sound control off (AS off), and noise cancelling (NC). A test sound with frequency variable from 100 - 2200 Hz was used. In AS off, the headset works as a passive ear muffler, which can be compared with a 27-dB passive hearing protecting device. In this respect, it is designed well enough to come close to the hearing protector. One should expect that with NC mode on, it should be at least as good or better than the hearing protector. However, from 1100 - 1600 Hz, one can hear very modest NC performance. This is slightly disappointing.Then, two other types of noise were used for testing: hair blower/bathtub water flow, and fire alarm siren.  One can hear the spectral change with AS off and NC for the first type of noise (hair blower, water flow), in which, the low frequency part was attenuated compared to the high-frequency part. But for the fire alarm siren, the NC was not that much different from AS off.I am not sure I would want to keep it, as far less expensive headset can already deliver this level of NC performance. But definitely, as a headset, the sound quality is excellent.For the sake of the completeness, perhaps other features should be reviewed also:1- mechanical comfort: quite good. It should be noted that sound, thermal insulation, and softness are inevitably correlated, so one should feel warm ear for any good sound and soft insulation headset. This one is well designed and has little discomfort regarding the warm ear effect.2- Bluetooth connection: quite impressive as I can still hear music clearly from the computer easily 50 ft away. The connection can be slightly glitchy, but perhaps it was due to Windows 10 problem. I had to reboot the computer and re-Bluetooth-pairing once or twice to get the computer to recognize "WX-HB900N". If it is recognized as "LE_WX-HB900N," the wireless headset doesn't work for some strange reason.3- will not work while being charged. So, one has to charge it full first before using. It draws only 0.25 A current while charging, hence, it takes a couple hours for a full charge.
Excellent bass, noise cancelling is up to par, bluetooth works seamlessly, and it has a long battery life. The only 2 issues I have with this product is thatA) if I have it turned on and have the audio jack plugged in, there is a slight buzzing that I hear. This happens regardless of the mode that I'm in.B) there is no noise to announce what mode you are in when you press the button to change modes. This feature was on other Sony products I used.Those are the only qualms I have with it though. Great product otherwise
I'm using the MDR-XB950B1's as my comparison as these were my previous headphones that broke that I reluctantly had to replace.Side by side, physically, these are an improvement in design with a sturdier frame and build. Fully over ear is certainly more comfortable and the cup covers are really nice out of the box. The hinges seem to have improved as this was the biggest flaw in the MDR's, but time will tell if their durability is truly an improvement. I'm not crazy on the foldable design choice however because it just increases the risk of breaking, so that's a feature I find as a downside.The sound quality was an immediate noticeable disappointment. I could tell that with the fully over ear design there was less audio leak and an improvement to the noise cancellation which results in the audio being louder, but the quality was still subpar compared to the MDR-XB950B1's. The biggest downgrade is the lower range of frequency. Not reaching the the 28,000hz the MDR's do is a huge difference making the audio much duller and greatly affecting midrange and treble. The Ohms impedance is also noticeable as it muddies the overall sound. This makes bass volume seem louder but lower quality in comparison because of the reduced clarity. I play a lot of atmospheric games and keen on my acoustics and vocals in music, both are hindered by the lower quality audio of these headphones. Another annoyance I noticed was that the audio isn't directly centered within the speakers, so your primary sounds play farther back than they should almost like the audio is always inverted. This throws me off when using directional audios in gaming, so highly do not recommend these for gamers.Overall, they're not BAD headphones, but for someone who was looking for a suitable replacement to an already great pair of headphones that came out 5 years ago, these just don't quite fit that need especially when they cost twice as much as the MDR's. Will be trying other headsets and might return these.
These headphones are very good, and offer even more than I realized in the way of features, but, you do need to download the app to take full advantage, and your options are limited to Android and iOS apps.  Not an issue for me, but part of why 4 of 5 stars.  Why no Win10 app?That said, the sound is very good, especially once set with the app, which allows you to adjust the sound EQ to several presets or a custom setting (my choice).  The default setting is as advertised, extra bass, nearly too much so, but adjusting that was easy enough, and is very clear.Additionally, you have options to use these headphones without noise suppression, with noise cancelling, or one of my favorites, ambient mode, which recognizes and boosts conversational tones, so you are not left yelling at those who talk to you.  Even better, the app allows the ambient mode a learning mode to tune to your environment, and even factors in room size and other factors.Another feature I like, even though I choose not to use, is the ability to interface with Alexa or Google Play.  Beware, if you choose to setup with Alexa, it changes your ambient/suppression switch to an Alexa or Google mode, and you will need the app to reset that button.  There are a few standard features that all noise cancelling headphones have that I won't mention here, because they just work well, as they should,  However, worth mentioning is that the battery life is quite good so far, though time will tell the story here.All things considered, I am impressed with what is offered for a price that is half of what one can pay for some of the big names in noise cancelling headphones, and certainly better than the cheaper versions I have seen.  I would like to see a better manual, as what comes with it relies on pictures to tell the story, but you can download a PDF version of the FAQ online that is more than sufficient to overcome that.If Sony added a PC app and manual with better delineation of features, it would be a 5 star review, as the features and sound quality are both outstanding!
Hands down, these are a personal favorite. However, I am not a audiophile nor a bass head (most days) or a audio snob. Im a IT professional who works in a server room 8 hours a day with the sound of fans, humming, and occasionally beeps.These headphones blocked out all the fan noise and humming, with no added hiss like on cheaper ANC headphones. But they arent designed to block sudden noises. So keep that in mind.The sound is unbelievable, if you aren't someone who likes a "airy" sound stage. As if you were sitting in front of the performance, that's what airy is, you get the sound of the music at peak recording but its not 100% on your ears. Kind of like its completely focused infront of you and not to your sides.These headphones are 2 amazing speakers strapped to your ears and they sound great! Bass is strong and can be tuned to your choice. The music is clear and clean.Comfort, youll fall asleep with these on. Don't tell my bossBattery, lasts 33 hours, roughly 4 8 hour work days and change. Charges pretty quickly but, I have a minor issues with my pair. They are constantly stuck at 70% charged. Not an issue just annoyance for a $200 pair of headphones.  Not everyone has this issue but don't freak out if you buy this and it happens to you.Sony Headphones App, the app is decent, nothing crazy. The spatial sound setting is neat, and how it can tell if im walking, sitting, on a train, etc. Is genius, keeps me alert and shuts out the hustle and bustle noise.Overall, 8/10. These are worth $300, sound amazing, have easy controls, amazing ANC, and bass that'll keep you moving. However, the battery issue and no hard case are issues to me. If skullcandy is selling their Venue headphones with a hard case for less, Sony can do it too ( Granted they have worse ANC and Sound but comparable bass)If you can afford it, buy them and you won't regret it. You'll never want to take them off, and it really helps for anyone in a noisy environment.Thank you and have a good day
I cannot seem to get the touch features to work when I want them to. Sometimes i'll reach for something above me and my arm will activate something and turn off my audio but whenever I try to do so with my hands it does not work.Sound is great and I can wear them most of the day without issue or headache.
Let me start off saying that I paid $380 USD with the competition in Bose NC-700 and I am wowed by so.ethung that is $200 USD cheaper. These are on par with the Bose. I believe even with the $350 USD versions of these they are still the same. The noise canceling is not better than Bose. Bose seems to have that locked down over even Sony. The bass, loudness, and over crisp delivery of music is slightly better. I am saying this because it seems that Bose works best with Apple anf not as good with Android. I have an older non-noise canceling Sony headset that I recently replaced with these. Those are still amazing to this date and I keep them at work in my office. I use them with my iPhone and those Sony headphones are not as crisp as using them with Android. I'm starting to see the light here. So my belief was to keep Bose with Apple and Sony with Android and so far I believe my theory is true. The Bose did provide much more  Intuitive app than Sony so I also give Bose the nod on that. Overall I prefer both. Still if you donot want to make the mistake like I did and pay $380 USD for headphones because you're an Audiophile like me and thought paying more meant quality then please stop and buy these. Save $200 USD and you won't regret it.

It‚Äôs very nice. I purchased this for my husband and he loves it.
I had a bad review at first since the headphones weren't that great sounding and the bass was missing ..SO AFTER feeling for buttons around on my headphones I noticed they turn up on the side by holding the next button down. That's when I discovered the headphones really aren't that bad at all. I was wondering where the bass was when all along it was there I just had to turn the sucker up..I said my fiance could have them but I'll take that back , im keeping them !!
They are really comfy, the sound is clear and travels nicely through both ears, and is very clear. Easy to connect to any device that I‚Äôve tried. And they are really good looking, the packaging was also very nice, came with a a charging wire and wire if you want to connect them to a device(not for iPhones tho) and they are adjustable, it‚Äôs a really good product and worth the money.
After about 3 minutes of use, all I got was a bunch of static playing over the music and videos I watched. Zero noise canceling.
We purchased these for 2 teen girls for Christmas. They love them. Work great.
I like them alot
This headstone would lose connectivity often.
I did not expect perfection at this price, but I did expect the headphones to do something, maybe muffle some noise, or let me listen to music, they do neither. I get better noise cancelation out of putting my hands over my ears. They do not connect to my phone and provide noise, they also do not connect to my computer and allow me to listen. They have been a complete disappointment. After I hit submit I will be throwing them away.
I've owned an SE7 for a few years and am very disappointed with the quality of construction.  With only light use, the fabric padding quickly deteriorated and it looks very shabby. Also, the plastic support frame broke with just normal use.  So minus 2 stars for the construction, but the sound quality and user controls are fine.
Purchased to block airport public address and chatter on aircraft.Not very effective. Returned for refund

This headphone is so comfy and cute looking. I'm sure no one can disagree with that. I just wish the quality is better. Please use better cord to make this headphone. It started to lose connection within 2 months of use. My son loves it so I had to get him another one. I will be willing to pay more for upgraded quality.
These worked great for my 3 year old. He used them with his tablet during a recent road-trip... 11 hours each way and he had no complaints. He seemed to find them very comfortable he would actually ask to put them back on when we  would stop to give him a break.
Kids loved then cast a bit more than just buying plain ones but to get cartoon or paw patrol this was the only one I could find just hope the sound doesn't drop in one ear like the cheap ones do every school year
I bought both sets of these headphone in early April, didn't open them until May and they did not last long at all. It is now July and both of them stopped working out of nowhere. My toddlers love Paw Patrol and they were so excited to get these headphone but now they are useless and they barely got to use them! I would not recommend.
When I got them they were broken. It wasn‚Äôt Amazon‚Äôs fault or the shipping. They came that way from the manufacture. Returned them with no problems and got a replacement set.
Having trouble hearing them now
Great price and durable for a kindergartner
I bought this for my son's first airplane trip. He slept thru the 1st flight and used them during the 2nd flight. They are already broken, only 1 side of the headphones work. Beware you are paying a lot of money got just the Marshall decor.My son went to use them today because I was sick and told me he couldn't hear.
Good headphones, especially when you don't want to hear the paw patrol theme song or baby shark for the umpteen time
The adjustable part broke on the first use and it was difficult to put back in place due to the wires. It's also difficult to see the volume control switch.

Vengo de muchos a√±os de experiencia con la marca Beats, quer√≠a probar esta marca ya que es muy nombrada en el mundo Dj y fue una decisi√≥n acertada
Nutshell, is that I have gone through several sets of headphones for my DJ gigs, but always balked at the price of the Vmoda.  They work perfectly, have enough power and clarity that I can hear my mixes and previews even in the middle of a dance at full volume.  I do a lot of school dances so I need to be able to hear and censor some songs live, other headsets just were not up to the task.  With these, I can hear every word, every nuance of the music.I gave it 5* for noise cancelling for that reason.  Call it 'passive noise cancelling'.They're comfortable enough that I can wear them all night, and flexible enough that I can pull one off my ears and rest it on my head to hear the house mix.  Just about the only gripe I have with these, is that they require twist lock pins for the wiring, so if you lose your cord you'll need to get a compatible cord or if you're in a pinch may need to shave down an existing one to fit.
I have been using these headphones for over five months now and I love them! I used to have Klipsch Image One headphones and while the sound was great, the build quality and comfort left more to me desired. The Crossfade M-100 Master solves both of these issues and sound slightly better than the Image One.The Image One was made of plastic and my most recent pair broke twice in two different spots around where the earcups meet the headband (I glued them back together the first time this happened). I take meticulous care of my things and it isn‚Äôt like they broke because I sat on them or something like that. The Crossfade M-100 Master is made of metal in these areas and so I don‚Äôt expect these to ever break in the same way. Another problem with the Image One is that, once the cushions began deteriorating, I couldn‚Äôt find replacements from Klipsch. Not only did they look unsightly, but I would find small pieces of the cushion in my hair! I can purchase new cushions easily from V-MODA‚Äôs website for $15! The last issue I had with the Image One in terms of build quality is that the cable could not be disconnected from the headphones. Once the cable began falling apart, I essentially needed to replace the headphones entirely. With the Crossfade M-100 Master, not only is the cable seemingly much stronger, but it is also removable. If it fails in the future, again I can go on V-MODA‚Äôs website and purchase a variety of new cables in a variety of different colors. Their cables also only connect to one earcup, instead of both like the Image One. This makes the Crossfade M-100 Master less restrictive since I don‚Äôt have a cable dangling under my chin like a chin strap to a helmet. I expect these headphones will last me an exceptionally long time!The final issue I had with the Image One was with comfort. If I had them on for more than two hours, my ears would start to hurt. I would need to take them off to give my ears a break. The first few times I wore the Crossfade M-100 Master I experienced slight discomfort after extended listening sessions, but that issue quickly disappeared. Perhaps the headband loosened up a bit with use? I have since enjoyed many months of extended listening sessions with zero discomfort!You do pay more money for this increase in build quality and comfort, but for how much I use these for TV shows, YouTube videos, and video games the investment is well worth it for me.
I got a pair of these for portable use in noisy places. I had the Sennheiser Momentum on-ear headphones and the Sennheiser Amperior headphones. I also have the NAD VISO M50. These are all excellent. In the summer, I'll wear the Sennheisers since they are cooler, being on-ear, and in winter, I will wear the V-Moda or the NAD, since they are warmer, being over-ear types.All of them are plenty efficient enough to be powered very well by any portable source without needing an extra amp.All of them will be comfortable, lthough, for the V-Moda, if your ears are large, the available ($20.00) XL ear pads from V-Moda will be absolutely necessary. The Amperior and V-Moda will be stable and stay in place on the head for very vigorous activity. The Sennheiser Momentum, and the NAD VISO, are stable on the head for moderate activity levels.They all offer terrific sound quality with wonderful deep bass, and great midranges and trebles.To differentiate between the NAD and the V-Moda, as they are both over-ear with similar closed can sonics, The V-Moda has slightly better details in the highs, and a bit more laid back mids than the NAD. They both have excellent bass that is well balanced and extends as low as you can hear, tight, flat, and with low distortion and no bloat. In both, the frequency response follows the Harmon curve closely, which means, they carry a good amount of weight in the lows, a natural sounding midrange, and nicely balanced brilliance in the highs. Either pair work well in imaging, and instrument separation and placement in the sound field. The V-Moda has a slightly smaller sound stage...very slightly, but more than makes up for that by the great detail and resolution it can produce in the image. If I were forced to pick one of these two headphones as the only ones I have, it would be a hard pick, since they are both so good. If I were able to EQ the NAD VISO M50 up 3dB in the top octave (over 10Khz) it could be my choice. Straight from any source, the V-Moda Crossfade M-100 Master is my pick, for sound, and style. It is better looking for public use, without sacrificing comfort or build quality, and has the edge in comfort and stability.
One of the best headphones I've ever had in all the aspects
Realmente a√≠slan el sonido.
I've had nearly every pair of headphones that V-MODA has made throughout the years.  I started with the M80 (on ear) which introduced me to the V-MODA sound, which I fell in love with.  As a hip hop aficianado the emphasis on the lower end without muddying up the mids and highs was really a remarkable accomplishment, especially in an on-ear model.  I used them for a few years until the update (The XS) came out and then the original M100.  Both headphones refined previous models and added a lot more features (hello cliq-fold hinges) while keeping with the sound signature that V-MODA had established as their house sound.  The original M100 was truly a work of art and for anyone that desired a little bass w/ their headphone, it was definitely a go-to recommendation.A few years has passed and the drivers in the M100s have evolved.  There seems to be a much cleaner and balanced sound overall.  The bass has been slightly reduced, but not enough for you to really notice without listening back to back with the original.  It just seems like it's faster and tighter, which adds to the texture and responsiveness of the headphone.  The mids and highs are a touch smoother with more articulation as well.  The sound stage seems to be the same to me.  So it really is just an evolution of the M100 sound...just refined V-MODA goodness.The only real downside to them is the fit...for me, the ear pads were too shallow and too narrow (even with the XL pads).  So I was hoping that the Master version would fix that issue.  They tried, and mostly got it right, but they are still a touch too narrow for prolonged use.  I can listen for about an hour to an hour and a half before my ears need a break.  If I could give 4.5 stars, that's what I would rate the Masters.I just wonder where V-MODA goes next given that Roland owns them completely.  Are they even going to exist in 2020?
Much smaller than I anticipated after viewing the images; I have quite small ears and these were small enough/pressed against my lobes uncomfortably that I went to double check I didn't order the XS variant V-MODA also sells for wired headphones.Additionally, one of the things that appealed to me about these was lots of marketing about the ability for the band to flex so you can listen with one ear; these are even less flexible than the Beats Studio Wireless I was going to replace with them!That said, the sound quality for the bit of testing I did was superb, and I was impressed at how effective the passive noise cancelling is! If they fit more comfortably these would definitely be the headphones for me, but with the comfort issue I'll be returning, sadly. :(
Amazing set of cans. People say these are for bass heads but I couldn‚Äôt disagree more. Yes they do have amazing bass but it‚Äôs not like having a 15‚Äù sub in your trunk. Couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with this purchase. I do a lot of recording within my home studio and am an avid gamer as well. Noise isolation is decent with the stock pads but I HIGHLY recommend going with the replacement pads by AHG. Sound quality is really good. I‚Äôve owned my fair share of cans from audio technical to senheisser and these hands down are by far my favorite. Whether I‚Äôm in the studio tracking ( I mix with my LP6s ) making beats, watching a movie or enjoying a gaming session, these headphones give me the immersion that the others were always lacking. The bass is spot on giving you a nice FULL sound whatever your doing without being to overpowering. The build quality..... honestly...... I have yet to own a pair of headphones that are as well built as these while still retaining comfort for the user. Solid solid SOLID construction. Great job V-Moda on an amazing set of cans!!! Highly Recommended for anyone that does studio work ( hip hop, edm, rock ) is in to gaming or anyone that just wants an amazing headphones with amazing build quality that will truly immerse you into whatever your doing with a rich full sound.
I have owned 3 pairs of Audio Technica WS1100's and the reason is because they sound incredible for their price, and also because the headphone jack keeps shorting out. I have been looking for something comparable in sound quality, but with better build quality, and I thought these would be it. I have read numerous reviews about how the M-100 would "change how I listen to music forever" and "the headphones are built like a tank" neither of which are true. They certainly sound good, however comparing them to my WS1100's which are about half the price, these just don't sound as good. There is more bass, however it is muddy compared to the WS1100 and they are much darker. The sound stage is good with a nice separation, however the mids seem to get lost behind the inaccurate bass notes. ( so much for the dual drivers ) or whatever Z-Moda is calling them. As for the build quality, I didn't feel that they are cheaply made, but they certainly didn't feel "heavy and solid" or "built like a tank" as many reviews have claimed. In my opinion, these are a good portable headphone that would be more accurately priced at 100 to 120 dollars as opposed to the whopping 250 that these cost. If you are in the market for a good sounding bass enhanced headphone, go with the Audio Technica WS1100 for half the price. In my opinion, they beat these all day. And that is probably why people shouldn't over hype things. As for the comfort level, well that is another point of contention. These are definitely on-ear phones. Why market them as over ears? I suspect that the reason is because V-Moda is trying to make these headphones a do it all solution, and it doesn't work. resting the pads on my ears as opposed to trying to stuff them inside the small opening felt more comfortable. So to wrap things up, knowing what I know now that I have had these in hand, is that they are a nice compact, portable headphone that would compete well in the 100 ish price range, but since they have been over hyped and over priced, I just can't recommend them.

I've had some Sony MDR-V6's for a lot of years now, and after reading tons of opinions on how they compare to their sibling, these MDR-7506's, I figured I would pick a pair up and do my own comparison.  I know this horse has been beaten to death, but it only took a short amount of listening to realize the differences.  But, before I get into it too far I just want to say that both models are excellent headphones; and it's amazing that either set can be had for less than $100.And a WARNING to all buyers.  Because these phones have been around forever, and because they are so popular (I think Sony sells more than 35,000 pairs of these a month) there are lots of fakes out there.  You can research this on the web, but the safest way to insure you are getting the real deal is to make sure that when you purchase here on Amazon you only buy when it says "Ships from and sold by Amazon.com".  It is the easiest way to be sure you're getting the genuine article.Everybody hears differently, and everyone "listens" differently.  We don't all enjoy the same types of music, and similarly, every set of headphones is not necessarily suited for every genre of music.  We all own different source components, and most of us have a limit as to what we are willing to spend on our gear.  I believe every headphone review should include a brief summary of the reviewer's musical tastes, sources, and gear and should always including references to other sets of cans they own, have auditioned, liked, or disliked.  With so many variables affecting peoples like or dislike of any pair of phones it is my goal to help those with similar musical tastes and similar gear to determine whether or not these headphones will be a good investment for them personally.To that end; I listen to music in practically every genre.  I tend to go through different phases, but I enjoy Mozart as much as Metallica, 80's one hit wonders and New Orleans Jazz, Lady Antebellum or Lady Gaga, Eminem to Zedd.  Music has so much to offer in all genres that one could spend a lifetime discovering new things they like.  I use my computer to play all the usual manner of digital files, and an Onkyo C-7030 CD player to handle disk duty.  Both feed into my Nuforce Icon DAC/Headphone Amp.  The digital files via USB and the CDs via analog RCA (the Onkyo has excellent onboard D/A conversion).  I have also been playing around with a Little Dot MK2 ii Vacuum Tube Amp (which I am really starting to love).  It should also be noted that I use no equalizer to modify the sound of my music (because I don't have one available in my setup).  My headphones include Sony MDR-V6s and these MDR-7506s, V-Moda Crossfade LPs and M-100s, Audio Technica ATH-M50s, Beyerdynamic DT-880 250ohm Premiums, Sennheiser HD 598s and HD 600s (my personal favorite) as well as my 4th pair of Koss Porta-Pros (easy to exchange when you live in Milwaukee) .  I've tried Grado SR 80s and SR 225s (just too darn uncomfortable), some Beyerdynamic DT990 Pro 250ohms (I prefered the DT 880s), and my son even owns a pair of first generation Beats Solo phones (Yuk).  The other day I threw away some Denon's (no clue what model, but circa 1990) and a set of Sony MDR-V600s that were both totally worn out.  I also own lots of buds as well (my Klipsh X10s being my favorite).Like I said at the beginning, these headphones sound great.  They are by far my favorite set of closed phones.  The crossfades are fun (they'll make your teeth chatter), but the sound is very unnatural.  The ATH-M50s sound excellent as well, but I prefer the Sony's more natural midrange.  I like them with most genre's of music, but I prefer them with classical, jazz, adult contemporary, jazz rock, and other similar genres of music.  The 7506's (and V6's) also give the widest soundstage of all my closed cans.  When comparing the sound to the V6's I would say this.  Both models have some of the most natural sounding mids I have heard in a headphone.  The V6s have more bass and noticeably higher highs, where the 7506's are flatter through the audible spectrum.  That's pretty much it in a nutshell.  It isn't hard to hear the difference, and you can see it as well by going to Headphone dot com's "build a graph" page and comparing the two.  The build a graph is an excellent page and when I look at the graphs for the various phones I own it shows exactly what I'm hearing myself.  I have heard many reasons for the differences between the two sets of Sonys from wiring to cup shape, and I've read all the references to the parts list that says they have all the same pieces, but all I'll say again is that there is a difference.  If you like a flatter sound with less of a "smile curve" then these 7506's are what you're looking for.  If you like a bit more bass and treble I'd recommend the V6's (though the highs can cause fatigue after a while).  If you are looking for cans to monitor or edit video then the 7506's are the ticket.  It's amazing how accurately they can playback the sound I record with my video camera, and it's no surprise that you see these on the heads of people in the movie business when you watch behind the scenes extras on DVD's and Blu-Rays.  I have taken the V6's to work and I use them with my little Nuforce uDAC-2 as the two pair together very well, and the 7506's are my go-to phones at home when open cans won't do.  The phones are very efficient as well.  They play plenty loud without a lot of power, though they sound even better with a nice amp.  They are also very revealing.  While you will hear lots of details in your music, you will also hear all of the flaws.  Music with accentuated highs may also sound shrill and sibilant when using these phones.  If you want lots of booming bass you'd be best to look elsewhere.  The 7506's have nice low, accurate, detailed bass, but they aren't thumpers by any means (nor are the V6's). If you want some serious thump on a budget watch for the V-Moda Crossfade LP's to go on sale (you will sacrifice detail and clarity, however).The build quality is excellent and I'm alright with the earpads wearing out and needing replacement from time to time (I'm on at least my 5th set in 2 decades with the V6's).  All earcups need to be replaced sooner or later, and if you shop around you can find the Sony replacements for a cheap price.  If you opt for some of the velour replacements that are out there you will (or you should) notice a change in the sound (I've tried them with the v6's).  It's also important to watch the foam part of the cups that covers the driver.  If it starts to break down it will get pushed into the holes in the front of the driver itself and it will ruin it (this is what happened to my V600's).  The phones are very light, the comfort is excellent, the clamping pressure is pretty light, and the sound isolation is really good too.  I also like the coiled cord and the quick change screw plug.  I have never had an issue with my cord on my V6's in almost 20 years and I don't foresee a problem with the 7506's.  The carry bag is handy and surprisingly durable as well.  I do wish they locked in a little tighter when you opened them as they often seem to want to close back up while trying to put them on.  You also have to be careful for the right side wire as it can get pinched in the whole works and possibly become crimped.You just can't go wrong with The 7506's or the V6's at the price they sell for.  You just have to decide which response curve you prefer.
I imagine casual music or movie fans are using Bluetooth more and more these days. And why not? It‚Äôs convenient and the sound technology is improving every year. That being said, wired sound is still king. For now. Wired headphones can get ridiculously expensive and while I have six pair of wired closed and open back, over ear and on ear headphones with a modest range from $79.00 to $250.00, I have to say this Sony deserves it‚Äôs industry standard dependable reputation. These are closed back over ear so they don‚Äôt leak any sound and they reveal a flat response to me which for a lot of casual music listeners means they aren‚Äôt heavy on bass (or mids and highs), They‚Äôre just right in lows, mids and highs. I enjoy all six wired for different reasons and convenience. I have two open back and four closed back including Grado, Sennheiser, Audio Technica, Beyerdynamic, Marshall and these Sony‚Äôs. The Sony‚Äôs are actually my most comfortable but because of our head shapes and ear size the comfort can be very subjective. What‚Äôs right for me may not be for you. The Sony‚Äôs feel durable and soft on the ears. The coiled cord is long and heavy duty which may be awkward to use on the move but it‚Äôs held up through the years. Very well. They‚Äôre made for being in one room and mostly sitting. The cord isn‚Äôt detachable like a few others of mine. To get the best sound I can I use a FIIO Alpen 2 power amp when listening to music through my phone. My files aren‚Äôt lossy. I‚Äôm old school, no mp3 for me. It‚Äôs an old fashioned way to listen to music these days with streaming being so popular but it‚Äôs still better sound as of 2022. Technology changes but in the meantime these Sony‚Äôs are the best way to get a trusty pair of durable great sounding and comfortable headphones that deliver. Don‚Äôt be fooled by their low end price. They‚Äôre worth every penny.
I was looking forward to using these MDR7506 headphones and was pleasantly surprised. They are so accurate! In one song, I heard the singer smacking their lips, which I never heard before. They have a clear sound with good separation, making them excellent for music production. For casual listening? Sure, but keep in mind, they're monitoring headphones that emphasize the higher midrange a bit. Some songs may sound better than others.For those interested, here are some EQ settings to help get a truly flat sound on these headphones:Band 1: Peak | 54 Hz | -6.0 dB | Q 0.7Band 2: Low Shelf | 105 Hz | +5.5 dB | Q 0.71Band 3: Peak | 150 Hz | -1.4 dB | Q 2.0Band 4: Peak | 250 Hz | +3.6 dB |Q 1.4Band 5: Peak | 300 Hz | -2.3 dB | Q 2.0Band 6: Peak | 3000 Hz | -3.5 dB | Q 3.0Band 7: Peak | 4550 Hz | -5.0 dB | Q 4.0Band 8: Peak | 6670 Hz | -5.4 dB | Q 2.5Band 9: Peak | 9300 Hz | -1.0 dB | Q 6.0Band 10: Peak | 11200 Hz | -3.0 dB | Q 7.0All in all, I'm happy with these headphones and would recommend them if you're into music production. I'd also recommend buying replacement ear pads and a case for them. These headphones can last a long time with proper care.
These are light and give incredible sound, you will not be disappointed.I bought a used digital piano (Yamaha p41) and told my brother a musician that I need practice headphones. He said the last pair be bought to were for his music gigs were $350, but that I should be able to find a pair for under $100 and gave me three manufacturers (which included Sony). I went on line and looked at several reviews and Sony MDR7506 was always in the top three and was even mentioned as a the model found in almost any recording studio. In addition, the MDR7506 was always the least expensive of the "professional" headphones in the internet articles. Easy decision, but how good are they?WOW, what a difference it makes in playing the piano. The little speakers in the piano are adequate but have to be turned all the way to maximum and still give a muddy and muffled sound. With the Sony MDR7506 headphones, I could hear the fullness of my digital piano, along with the subtle changes in tone and loudness based on how I played each note, and that was at half volume. With these on, I felt like I was playing a $50,000 grand piano.I practice from 30 minutes to an hour at a time and the Sony MDR7506 are light and easy to wear without any fatigue associated with other over the ear headphones I have used in the past. Plus the ear cushions can be replaced for $20 if they ever get worn or torn. And finally, the cord has plenty of length and the end has an 1/8" jack, but comes with a 1/4" adapter that can screw in over the 1/8" jack with ease.These headphones are highly recommended from experts on the internet, my bother the musician, and now me (a 63 year old beginning piano student). I have recommended the Sony MDR7506 to a friend who has an old component stereo from the 1970's, and my 35 year old son who is tired of using some hand-me-down headphones.  You may be able to find cheaper, but you will not find better at this price.Jack in and turn it up. I also plan on getting out my old Boston, Chicago, Doobie Brothers, and Lynard Skynard albums and giving them a spin like in my college days in the dorms. I wish I had these back then.
I won't get into the sound quality, as there are better reviews in that area - long story short, they sound great. What I do want to point out is that these headphones have an extremely annoying flaw; however, it's easily fixable with some yarn or something similar. After putting the headphones on, I noticed they were making an extremely loud and annoying "creaking" sound into my ears any time I'd move my head the slightest bit. The sound was annoying enough that I couldn't stand using them and was considering returning them and getting different headphones. After some brief investigating, I realized that it was coming from the "joint" where the "cans" are connected to the headband. There happened to be a small space between the cans and the joint which was allowing for side-to-side movement between the two, which occurred with any slightest movement while wearing them. However, I was able to easily pull some yarn between the gaps on either side of the joint and tie it off, which practically eliminated the issue (see attached pictures for reference). With that problem solved, the headphones are great.
I have worked in live broadcast radio for just shy of 50 years as I write this. About 20 years ago I also included some recording studio work and music production into my routine.  As well as doing voice overs and commercial production with my own company for decades.  A large part of every day is spent in headphones.This includes also the production of thousands of radio commercials and voice overs every year.  All this work requires headphones.  Now, to be honest, for my daily live show I prefer Sennheiser headphones.  There are certain models that play LOUD without distortion, and are made of some type of mysterious flexible plastic that makes them indestructible, and they have easily replaceable plug in cables without the coiled cord.  And since when on the air every morning they are put on and taken off about a hundred times, they are perfect mechanically for that.And I know that this review sounds like a Sennheiser review -- but hold yer pants on.  For audio production work - commercial production - voice overs - music mixing and mastering - a different kind of headphone is needed. Excellent full range sound -- clarity in the highs AND lows.  And the comfort to leave them on for longer periods when tracking, mixing, and doing critical listening.  I have found these Sony headphones to be excellent for this work.  I have produced thousands upon thousands of radio commercials and music tracks and productions in these 'phones.  Oh, yeah, you can spend more - a lot more - and get a different sound -- and really, when you get right down to it, headphones depend a lot on personal taste, your own hearing abilities, comfort, and most importantly what YOU get used to - that YOU can use as your own personal reference when it comes to doing sound as your job, or sound for your own enjoyment.  These are very good at meeting the needs for thousands of music producers and radio and studio people.Be aware that some will review and say "I didn't like these headphones -- not enough bass" for example. That just might be because your source - your music - your amp - your system - isn't giving you the amount of bass you like. The idea isn't to buy headphones that will color the sound to what you like, but to give you an honest representation of the audio. This is why music sources have tone and equalizer controls on them.I *can* tell you that I know for a fact that I personally know major players in the voice over business -- people whose voice you hear on movie trailers in the theaters and on thousands of major national and world wide radio and television commercials, and endless network television promos, who are using these headphones in the studio and there's a reason for that.  That main reason is that they give you a reliable indication of what your final product is going to sound like, and they're comfortable and reliable.They also keep outside noise from getting into your ears.  They seal you in good and isolate you from stray noise and distractions.  Which also makes them great for critical work, but less handy in an on air situation when you might at least want to hear someone yelling at you in the room lol.The only drawbacks I can share are, they are crummy for portable/traveling situations. They're somewhat awkward to put on and off (hence the Sennheisers on the air) and the foldable feature might be nice when you want to put them in the case (optional) and toss them in an equipment bag or suitcase for an away gig but I can't imagine using these in a more portable use.Oh, and when you need to replace the ear pads (and you will) here's a tip -- the OEM Sony pads are relatively expensive.  There are pads for Beyer Dynamic headphones that fit perfectly, and equally comfortable, and much less expensive.There are a ton of headphones out there. Some people prefer Beats, for example, which give you a very exaggerated bass response -- fine if you like hearing more bass than intended, but horrible if you want to know what your voice or music mix actually sounds like.  You often see popular singers in the studio in their videos wearing some sort of gaudy headphones -- that look like they're wearing huge pink coconut halves on the side of their heads -- nice visual effect but I can assure you the cats mixing the music aren't wearing those.You can count on these Sony's for getting the job done. And you can count on them for comfortable and enjoyable music listening too. They're not just for studio work.
I am a radio professional / talk radio - podcast audio editor.I discovered my first set of these about 20 years ago and used them almost daily for critical listening : hiss, hum, gasps of air, ummmms, aaaahs, lip smacks and more. These "cans" don't cover up these sounds or have a frequency response so bad you never hear the problem.In the past 10 years I've logged in 500+ hours of editing shows and several audiobooks.  I still use the same set I got twenty years ago.  This set is a spare, just in case the original dies some day.Great for music too...they make other ones in this price range sound like two paper cups and a string.And comfort?  For those 500+ editing hours, I had them on my head!  Never once did I complain about sore ears.These are the real thing, no LEDs, no Bluetooth, no gaming mic, no noise cancellation, no batteries.Just a real tool for professionals.
I did return these but it had nothing to do with the quality. The monitors fit well and feel better than the Sennheiser HD250's I ended up with. I think it is just a preference thing when it comes to comparing the two. They are fantastic and in almost every studio you see for a reason! They fit my head perfect as the Sennheisers I am having to stretch over a wide speaker I have every time I am done with them and they are starting to not be so tight. If doing this would bother you then I highly recommend the Sonys!
Well I wanted a good corded headset for playing guitar and listening to music. Headphones for this purpose can cost hundreds of dollars if not more. I read numerous reviews of many but this model from Sony which apparently is a work horse and got my attention. You can not beat the cost for the cleanest sounding headphones. If you want a boomy bass and lots of fillers to blast your music, you probably dont want these. The sound from these are just clean and you will hear the difference in the quality of the recordings and production. They sound much different than ear pods or Beats headphones because they are clean and have no fake boosting sounds. They are not ultra compact to travel but you could if you want to but just remember they are corded. I like them a lot. They are comfortable, the ear pieces swing so they are user friendly and the sound is pure and clean.
There are some people who like a nice quality, balanced, yet flat sound. Sony MDR7506 does the trick and is all that you need. I use these headphones for recording and editing my audio for Voice Over, and love these. These are the best headphones I've had... then again, I'm not an audiophile either but since doing VO, my ear-training is improving and these headphones help me to achieve better ear training.Crew members use these in movie/tv productions, so this product is a big deal. Plus they will last you for years. The only thing you may have to change out every few years are the ear cushions.5 out of 5. I absolutely recommend.

Since I have quite a few headphones ranging in cost from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars the AP2000ti is easily one of my favorite headphones I've ever had.  From build and comfort to the awesome SQ this is a headphone worth the cost IMO.I will say that if you don't like headphones on the brighter side then these aren't for you but don't take that as them being sibilant because they are not.  The sound is crisp and clean with some of the cleanest and clearest bass I've ever heard, they aren't bass-heavy and I would say they are more neutral in the bass but depending on what you're listening to they can have a nice thump to them with good sub-bass.  Mids are a little behind the highs but not as much as you'd think for a headphone with this signature.  Like I said the highs are on the brighter side but never get offensive and the detail retrieval is top-notch.  Soundstage is good for a closed-back headphone and the imaging is also very good with instrument placement being right where you expect them.If you're looking for a good closed headphone under $1500 these should be on your shortlist, good for home and office or even on the go if you have a backpack or bag.

I've gone through 3 pair of these in the last 5 years using them every single day in my studio (I'm a drummer).  I use them on stage, too, if I don't want to deal with in-ears (particularly if clarity of sound isn't crucial).  That to say: sound quality is so-so; the low-end leaves some to be desired but most of the mix is there.  Using and abusing these (on the road stored in a pedal case or backpack) the weakest link is around the volume knob.  Every pair I have had has developed a short in the cable around the volume knob, however the volume knob is my favorite part of these headphones.  Having that autonomy in a studio or on stage has been amazing... I'll do my sound check with the knob at about 80% volume, then I have some freedom up or down for my stage mixOverall: BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK FOR ISOLATING HEADPHONES I'VE TRIED ALL OF THEM... Go ahead and take a nail file to the pointy corners on the headband‚Äî they round out with just a touch of something rough
These are far from perfect. They are very difficult to adjust the head strap size, they are bulky and have metal clamps on the side where you may even scratch yourself with them. They also be done if the heaviest headphones I've owned. That, and the cord they is way too long.All they said, the sound quality for the price is unbeatable. Sure there is little bass but these headphones are not meant for bassheads. If you have a DAC then you're going to absolutely love the hell out of these are it really brings to life these headphones.The sound is very crisp and clean and very neutral, is that makes any sense. I really love these.
Great product just wanted a little more sound reductionUse it for nascar races
Too tight for my large head. Starts to hurt after a few hours. Not a good all day coding/programming headphone.
I use these for tv watching- super good sound quality-superb noise canceling-were a bit tight when I first got them- Hurt my jaw at first but after some adjustment they feel fine. Highly recommend these.
What I don't like is the headphones are very tight on my ears.  I would like to loosen them somewhat.  Also I fear that the headpiece will break as it appears to be made from a hard Styrofoam,  but that's a guess.
When I was first looking for headphones, I was running through all the ways I could block out the insanely loud (and incredibly distasteful) music that my dorm roommate was playing at all hours of the day. My first venture was through BOSE's collection of noise-cancelling headphones, which easily ran over several hundred dollars. Being a college student, I didn't have much money to spare, and I opted for the Koss QZ-99, which was only $41 off Amazon--and included free shipping for Amazon Prime customers.So far, the sound quality is only mediocre at best--the bass is almost nonexistent, but the sound comes in with very little disruption from the outside. The headphones are big, bulky, somewhat heavy, and *very* tight on the ears, especially for big-headed people like me. The headphones are decently comfortable because they fit snugly around the ear, rather than sitting on top of the ear and squishing all of your ear parts. There is a Mono/Stereo switch about halfway down the headphone wire, which can be somewhat inconvenient if you have to squeeze the wire through a very tight spot, but the ability to switch between the two is helpful for those who like to fiddle with their sound functions. In addition, there's a sound knob on the left side, but it's unmarked, so sometimes you may forget that your sound isn't turned all the way up. Although it looks like the headphone jack is extremely short in the display picture, you can actually stretch that up to about 20 feet, if the thing you're plugging the wire into is stable enough. However, the part that I was most excited about--the noise reduction--disappointed me the most. I guess I should have expected less-than-great quality for sound blocking, since I *did* pay only $41 for these, but they block about the same amount of sound as if I cupped my hands over my ears. Sound from conversations still manage to creep into the headphones, and unfortunately, it barely even drowned out my roommate's loud music at all.However, for quieter, ambient noises, this product blocks them all out. The past week my roommate was working on a paper--without music--and he complained to me that I was typing on my keyboard too loudly (the sounds of which were drowned out completely by these headphones).Also, some people have complained that the thin metal is sharp enough to cut your hand with. This is completely false. While it does have flat and not rounded edges, I think it's easier to cut your hand on paper than it is to cut it on the metal on this product.Bottom line--a mediocre product with little noise reduction capability. It might be better to shell out a few more dollars for a higher quality product.
I wanted headphones that covered the full ear and would stay in place as you moved around. This met my criteria. But, it is big and heavy and kinda bulky
I bought this specifically for shortwave communication listening, they sound great when I use them with either the ICOM-IC75 or my Grundig Millenium 800. I have tried them with my Sony Hi-Res player, sound is OK but they are difficult to drive, connected to the stereo, too much volume and the headphones start to clip, I have AudioTechnica 'phones for listening to music so not a big deal.
Wow, just WoW! .. These are like the ear protection we used in the military.. we called them micky mouse ears.. they were hard plastic cups that encased the ears with sound silencing materials lining the inside.  If you combined micky mouse ears with the little plastic insert ear plugs you became effectively deaf.. well tehse headphones are like mickey mouse ears with speakers installed.  They passivly block external sounds thru extremely effective sound silencing. and the audio is not bad either.  the cable is curly so it does not get caught up in my chair's wheels or drag on the floor.. yet it has the reach where i can stand up and move around the room a bit  so i love the cord.. love the headphones.. the ONLY draw back is they do put some pressure on your head.  and being a bit airtight you might sweat in a hot environment. bottom line is tho i have found the love of my life when it comes to headphones.  I really like these headphones, they are high quality construction.  They sound great too but i'm no sound expert.  They are over the ear.. except they rest on the bottom of my earlobes.. update: july 2015, well the adustable volume makes the left ear drop out.. you have to spin the volume back and forth like your wearing thru the corrosion on the resistor parts so it gets a good connection.  The wires are solid.. the connections are solid.. I believe this intermittant left ear connection is in the variable resistor itself.. not in a faulty wire or connection.  So sadly we go from a 5 to something less due to they used a cheap part.. which cheapened what would otherwise be a first class product.  I know this product is discontinued so perhaps this was why.  bottom line is the left ear is dropping out  and i have to mess with the volume knob to restore the left ear sounds.  i might try the upgraded version of this and pray they aren't using the same part that is failing here.

Way smaller than advertised. My five year old has a very average sized head and these were too small.
I realize its meant for children and it probably wouldn't have lasted long but I got it April 10th and it stopped working like one week ago. Today is May 6th. I had previously ordered a set of earphones and obviously my child would drop it, run away when it was still connected and it broke. My child is 5 and understood that the last one she had wasn't taken care of properly. So this time she dropped it maybe once but nothing was broken, the wires are all still connected and one day she said she couldn't hear it anymore. I tried everything and nothing working. I wiggled the wire on the headset and on the plug side and nothing worked. I even connected it to my phone and laptop and neither worked. The headset just stopped working. I still leave room for saying she may have pulled it too hard or dropped it too hard but I don't think it should have given out that easily. The last pair she had lasted longer than this and she was a lot more careless with that pair. And she hardly uses them, we used it mainly when she was in the car or at home during these online hw assignments.
Daughter loved the design on these plus uses them regularly at school.  Only shortcoming is that the earphone only cover about 75% of her ear.  As she grows we will eventually need to get a bigger one.
They seem a little on the small side. They were too small for my 5 year old.
A bit disappointed  these are very small. I didn‚Äôt read close enough as these were ordered for my 7 year old and are very small.
We BFF l night these for our 6 almost 7 year old for school.  We pulled them out and they were way to small.  Description described them as 3-10 Years of age.  Only a toddler could fit these.
These headphones were a little smaller than we expected. They just barely fit our 7-year old daughter. But she likes them and says the sound quality is good through them.
The headphones are very cute but small. Barely fit my 7 year old. She broke them within the month ...
Not as described, the color on the picture shows the bright teal  or is and pink the one I received is black and pink.
Good but wire thin for kids easy to break

cord too short
great sound
To all you spoiled Americans and your decadent ways... Why have two channel audio when all you need is one? Listen to old scratchy voice recordings in glorious monaural sound the way nature intended with these Califone Deluxe Mono Headphones. Construction is fairly well built for the price, but we know that you really just bought these headphones for the style factor. If you have an abnormally large head as I do, you will receive the added bonus of a dull headache after a few minutes of extended use. The 1/4 inch plug is well built and solid. Gets the job done. If these headphones won't plug into it, you don't need it.
You generally get what you pay for.
had to order an adaptor to use
Not whatnot expected nor needed, maybe will work for a library or school.
Nice sound.  I purchased five of these and would have gave a 5-star but the earphone padding comes off after several uses on two of the headphones.
Decent for the price. Mono headphone.
Okay headphones, but medium fidelity.  Deficient in both bass and treble.  Will work okay for spoken word.
Work great.  Get a mono adaptor if you want to use it with a mono device like smart phone or note pad.  Amazon is the only place I could find one.  Even Radio Shack didn't have one.

First off the cost. These bad boys originally sold for 250$ in 2019. I'd say for over 100$ less, these are a great grab (but maybe not the original price point). The comfort, I have a huge head. And found that these were uncomfortable to wear after the first hour or so of use. But the material does bend over time and now I can wear them for about 3-4 hours before noticing discomfort. The sounds is very nice. You do get that deep bass and nice crisp treble. The mids are just ok. The guitar sound is one thing this headphone lacks in for me, vocals and most instruments sound great but the guitar is a bit muddy. With some eq you can actually make this much better. Also not using Bluetooth you can get even better cleaner audio, but you need a small portable Amp to actually power them or just a really strong phone. I prefer these to the m50x. Just because bass respone is better and I like the treble more. Without eq the m50x has better mids but once you eq these, it's no contest. The bass and treble is a definite bump up in improvement though. Also as far as noise canceling goes. It's not great, but it's not bad either. I'd give it like a 6.5/10. Bose and Sony does a better job with noise canceling headphones. Went to a busy Cafe and couldn't hear anything at about 60% volume. The ambient mode is laughable. I actually hate it. It Lowers the volume too much and amplifies the sound around you like barely but in weird ways. If the ambient mode worked like the Apple air pods pro. I'd give these 5 stars
The overall volume is very, very low. Unless you're in a perfectly quiet environment these will not get loud enough to enjoy any music or video thoroughly.They are quite comfortable however, and synced up immediately. If you have extremely sensitive hearing or otherwise need to protect your hearing somehow, these are ok. I would recommend getting anything else though. I wore them for about a minute before putting them in the box and returning them for something better like Sony or even Bose.
Not for me, signature is without flavor, Bass is ok, I prefer a most warmer signature.
I don't get it. All the reviews are good. They connected with Bluetooth easily. I put them on and I was blasted with a very flat sound. A little bass, no real highs, and at higher volume the sound was almost distorted sounding. I tried boosting the highs with the onboard equalizer and the high end just wasn't there. Like a pair of really bad earbuds from the dollar store. I really couldn't believe my ears. I thought that maybe it was a problem with the device. I connected to another device with Bluetooth. Same thing. So I connected directly with the audio cable that came with them. Same sound, only louder. They are very loud when you connect them directly. Did I get a bad pair? All the reviews rave over the sound. I tested them on a full size system, a laptop (with great sound), and a new Android phone. I boxed them up and shipped them back for a refund. It must have been a bad pair. I just received a pair of Treblab Z7 Pros and OMFG! Incredible sound on all my devices. As for these Audio-Technica ATH-WS990BT ....Well, I just don't know.
I love these headphones. The bass boost is just the right amount. It really just fills out the sound compared to studio monitors. These aren't bass heavy like Beats or anything, just a tasteful, grown up, full sound.
Was hoping to get these to replace my WS-1000is for wired at home on my AMP / DAC and then take them to go when I head to work or the library. They do a little bit of everything pretty well but end up being pretty lack luster at anything in particular when compared to a specific headset of the same price range.The sound is good (wired), just a little suffocated compared to the semi-open backs of the other Solid Bass Headphones. The bass is smooth but just not solid like the WS-1000is. The mids and highs are crispy but they just don't feel responsive or as clean as other Audio Technica Headsets. As for bluetooth they're probably great, but honestly bluetooth is meant for convenience not powerful listening.I will say though, if you need something capable of a little bit of everything, they have nice drivers for wired and their battery life / connection is really strong. The aesthetics are pristine, awesome design.Was disappointed in these because I absolutely loved the ATH-MSR7s and love my WS-1000is. However the comfort falls short, bluetooth audio in general is awful, the features kind of suffer compared to other headsets at this price range. I wouldn't pay over $150 for these, definitely not worth their MSRP of $250. I'd say pass these up unless you get a nice deal on them.
Sound is better than Bose or Sony at loud levels with no distortion. When wearing them outside, if the wind is blowing it somehow gets right passed the muffs and you can hear it in the music. Very comfortable for long wear. Unfortunately my left ear driver cracked the first week I owned them so I returned them. May have gotten a bad pair but for 250$ I think every pair should be a good pair, so I took the refund and will be trying another model or brand.
I'm an avid fan of Audio Technica, owning 4 pairs of their headphones already.  I saw that this pair of wireless ones had the same drivers (53mm) as my favorite model the ws1100is.  I was hoping to have similar performance, but these things just weren't for me.  I'm pretty used to blasting music with an amp and quality headphones.  These WS990BT's were simply way too quiet for me.  I also work in a manufacturing building and the noise cancellation had a really hard time drowning out consistent machine noise.  Tried using them wired with an amp and even still they just didn't feel up to snuff.Love the company, but for this price range there are many better competitors that hit the mark a lot better.  Returned them within a week of owning.
THE GOOD- SQ is pretty good.  Expansive (for a closed back).  Bass is definitely "solid" and not muddy or overdone.  Balanced signature that works well with multiple genres.- Comfort is good with large earcups and soft cushioning.- Build quality is good with nice fabrication of components.- They look beautiful.THE BAD- ANC is horrible.  Very ineffective and makes little difference.  Hissing very audible and sounds stronger on the left side.  Seems like ANC was added as an afterthought.- Imbalanced ambient mode.  The left side opens up to the environment considerably more than the right side, so when ambient mode is activated, everything is louder on the left side.  Defect?  Bad implementation?- Mic for calls is nothing special.  Don't expect to make business calls on this.- Way overpriced for what you get.  They should have ditched the ANC altogether OR actually gave you some decent ANC/ambient for the price ($280).OVERALLSeemingly rushed, half-baked product that never should have been released.  Pass on this one.
I tested the ATH-WS990BT, the HD1 Wireless, the PXC 550, and the h.ear on 2. Of these, the AudioTechnica (this phone) were the worst! So disappointed. In critical categories - sound, anc, comfort, functionality, usability - these were the worst. And they are all at the same price-point, if you buy refurbished. I eventually decided on the h.ear on 2.

For about $20, not a bad buy. Sound quality is ok and the velcro adjusts well.
Sorry I bought them.
If you're a side sleeper buy a different product. These arrived yesterday and after only using them for about 5 hours my ears became incredibly sore from how bulky the speakers are and how they pushed on my ear canal and ear cartilage while sleeping on my side. When I tried moving the speakers a bit lower to be centered on the canal and lobe my ears were already sore and the fabric that goes over the bridge of your nose was so far down it was fully covering my nostrils.

I wasn't the one to buy these, I was given them. But as I love the bass, the earcups would snap off of the headband, rendering the headphones useless. I now have another pair, and will be more careful with them. I would recommend buying two of these, in case one of them break.
sehr kleine Kopfh√∂rer, dachte zuerst passen garnicht auf meinen gro√üen Kopf, aber passt sich super dem Kopf an, sehr Basslastig. Verarbeitung macht einen guten Eindruck. Das Kabel hat ca. 1m l√§nge nicht wie angegeben 1,8m ! alles in allem Top !
Tonqualit√§t war in Ordnung. Aber die Qualit√§t l√§sst zu w√ºnschen √ºbrig. (Die sind nach ein paar Wochen kaputt gegangen)
Se escuchan muy bien, y de precio est√°n genial te envuelve bien la oreja y eso me gusta ya que no escucho ni un ruido de fuera
Die Kopfh√∂rer sind zwar g√ºnstig, sollten aber funktioniern.
Nice headset . Microphone embedded but good.
Muy ligeros. Bien acabados. Cable  minijack trenzado extra√≠ble. Calidad de sonido m√°s que aceptable. Adem√°s incorporan micr√≥fono en el mismo cable, control de volumen, y bot√≥n para descolgar.Como "pero":  cuando hablas por tel√©fono con ellos, a veces tienes que acercarte el cable a la boca para que te escuchen bien.
Estoy gratamente sorprendido con estos auriculares. Me han costado 20‚Ç¨ y son la alternativa perfecta a otros modelos mucho m√°s caros y de marcas mucho m√°s conocidas, pero a los que no tiene nada que envidiarles. Por cierto, aislan de maravilla del ruido exterior y son comod√≠simos una vez puestos
me los compr√© en abril, estamos en julio y ya se lo romperon de la nada. primero fue el cable, que con poco m√°s de un mes de uso, se estropi√≥ y yo tuve de comprar un cable extra.ahora es el plastico se rompe de manera que lo tengo que tirar. no lo compren, es un producto de pesima calidad.
El sonido es aceptable por el precio, lo que no es aceptable es que se haya desenganchado (por s√≥lo extender un poco) todo el lateral de uno de los auriculares, quedando colgando por el hilo de cobre. Ha quedado roto definitivamente. Mala experiencia, no recomendado.

The headset is very very comfortable and sounds great. Headset was so comfortable that a little spider decided it wanted to make it his little home inside the ear peice. Thats how comfty it was.
I am all over the place regarding my thoughts on the PLY Headset. I certainly like the playful, youthful design. I appreciate the subtle multi-color scheme on the sides. It does not go full neon -except for the stiff, bubblegum-looking blue USB and pink 3.5mm cable, which thankfully can be replaced by whichever one you‚Äôd prefer. They are well made, although I worry a bit about the cloudy see-through covers and headband (which is quite flexible). The earpads are made of this super soft cloth-covered memory foam and feel rather premium.They are quite light and comfortable. The suspension-style headband produces very little pressure on my head. I was able to wear them for 3-4 hours sessions with no discomfort, overheating, or soreness on my head and ears. The clamping force is light -almost too much, as sudden headshaking will cause the headset to fall off. So, if you get too physically excited during a game, these cans may not be for you.On paper, the PLYR is supposed to be a wireless multi-point audio solution between platforms. However, there are a few caveats to doing so. While one can always be paired to a Bluetooth device, one must use the USB or 3.5mm cable to have a simultaneous audio connection. This defeats the wireless experience unless you fork up $20 to get a dongle, which is strangely not available at the moment. In reality, these are primarily wired headsets with Bluetooth 5.2 capability. Also, I did experience more than a few hiccups, disconnects, pauses, and sync issues. Having said all this, I actually enjoyed listening to a podcast on my phone or answering calls without pausing the game on my PC.The sound is good out of the box. Depending on certain content, the bass has some impact and even some of that sub-woofer feeling. However. it can get a bit bloaty at higher volumes. The mids and treble are where these cans mostly shine. They bring a good amount of clarity without being harsh or sibilant. There is decent channel separation, and the soundstage is sparse. This makes playing FPS games especially enjoyable.The removable microphone is average. The boom mic is very stiff, and I couldn‚Äôt get it closer to my mouth which is why I think it is on the quiet side -even at 100% input. Some people definitely noticed it when playing.I am very impressed with the Skullcandy Gaming App. From volume, mic gain, game/chat, sidetone, and firmware updates, it is full of options, settings, and tweaks. You can choose a preset EQ, as well as customize it completely.  It‚Äôs quite easy to use and rather functional.In the end, the PLYR headset is a good entry for gamers that wish to be connected to their phones while playing. I do wish a wireless dongle would‚Äôve been included, as this would have made this a must-buy. If it wasn‚Äôt for the app and decent price point, this would‚Äôve been 3 stars at best.
Our house has become a headset house with all the gaming and work from home. Because of that we‚Äôve gotten a variety of headphones.Pros:- comfortable gel ear pads- comfortable elastic band over head- detachable microphone- good sound- easy to use exterior click and dial controlsCons:- heavy compared to others- not foldable for travel- usb Bluetooth transmitter costs extra (really?)- odd coloring- wish small bag included for accessories
I've only used wired headsets previously, but my current ones are starting to see some wear, and I wanted to give this headset a try.  I was incredibly pleased with the results.There is a tiny bit of assembly required as the elastic band that rests on your head comes as a separate piece.  It has two different sets of attachment holes to allow you to adjust for your preference, and they simple press into place.The headset is lightweight and holds itself in place without feeling like it's squeezing your head.  The ears are fabric, not leatherette, so it won't crack and flake over time.  The memory foam is also very comfortable and provides good sound dampening.It also has very simple controls.  The power switch is responsive, the volume setting adjusts quickly, and the side buttons on the earpiece are a great plus.  Pressing the top can play/pause music or a video or answer/decline a phone call.  The bottom button mutes/unmutes the microphone.The headset connects very easily.  Pushing the power button up sends it into pair mode, and every device I tried instantly recognized it and connected without any issue.  It comes with a USB cable for charging or plugging into a computer, and it immediately registers as an audio input/output device.  It also includes a 3.5 mm cable to connect to a gaming controller or any other device with a headphone jack.It recommends using the app or desktop client for tuning the audio, and it does make a difference.  It sounded pretty good out of the box, but I went through the hearing test that it does, and all the tones and sounds picked up to match my hearing perfectly.  It also only took a few minutes to complete, so I highly recommend going for that customization.My favorite feature is the additional microphones that remove the need for the boom mic.  I tried it with and without the boom, and people could hear me well and clearly both ways.  Going without the boom also surprised me by not picking up much background noise.It charges easily, and it holds the charge well, even through multiple hours of use.FINAL WORD: If you want a wireless headset, you want this one!
Design/Appearance:-----------------------These over-the-ear beauties are gorgeous. The overall design and color palates can't be beat. 1980s Vice City pinks and blues and even some clear colors... I'm wearing them right now without even playing music because they are so pretty and comfortable. Call me ridiculous if you want.Controls:----------The controls are perfect and easy - tap on the top for play/pause, tap on the bottom to mute/unmute the mic, and a physical analog dial for the volume... WHICH I LOVE. I absolutely love volume dials/knobs. And I hate it that they are becoming so rare.Sound:--------The sound quality is fantastic, although for this price point, they should have active noise canceling. It's too bad they don't. But long-pressing the top button does something... is that an attempt at noise canceling? It doesn't seem to change much.Gaming Use / Latency:---------------------------As I've said in other bluetooth, latency is always an issue. However‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt seem to find any here. Other reviewers have complained about it- please go check out the details. But I can‚Äôt personally find any delay or lag issue. SO much better than my earbuds, which I can‚Äôt even watch Netflix with.-Sidetone (the ability to hear yourself talk) can be turned on and off- awesome.-Modes - single-click the volume wheel. I have no idea what they do (FPS/RPG/Music/Default) and I can‚Äôt tell a difference. Gimmick?Misc.-------Very expensive. Worth it? Not for me. But it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that these are awesome.-Comes with audio cable and USBA-USBC cable, both excellent quality.-Like most bluetooth headphones, it can only connect to one device at a time. And it gets to decide which device gets priority. Annoying.-Lastly- The box‚Äôs promise that this device is ‚ÄúCompatible with‚Ä¶‚Äù and then naming every type of gaming console and computer and device is both ridiculous and condescending. It‚Äôs bluetooth. IT IS BLUETOOTH. There is no compatibility to question. Don‚Äôt insult us, Skullcandy.
The Skullcandy PLYR is very similar in design to SteelSeries Arctis headsets. It has a band to distribute the weight across your head, and I really like the thick ear cups which fit around the ear instead of compressing the ears against the head. The ear cups are also foam with a cloth cover instead of leather material so it breathes better and keeps your ear and head from getting sweaty after extended use. I also thought the audio quality was very good without having to tweak any equalizer settings. Bass was solid, and delicate high notes from Bach's Chaconne came out clear as well. As a bluetooth headset for listening to music, these work great.But if you're wanting them for serious gaming, you'll be disappointed. There is slight audio latency due to the bluetooth connection, so watching a video or playing a game means the audio won't sync with the visual image. This is a known issue with bluetooth, which is why gaming headsets usually come with a 2.4ghz USB transmitter for the wireless connection. Skullcandy is aware of the issue and suggests you purchase the wireless transmitter (sold separately) for an ultra low latency connection. Gamers spend good money on low latency and ultra fast response times for their wireless mice and keyboards, so not including the transmitter with this headset that's advertised for gaming seems like a big miss. You can used the wired connection to mitigate the latency, but then its a wired headset.As a plain bluetooth headset, this is 4 stars (somewhat pricey, no noise cancellation). For a gaming headset, 2 stars because it sounds good, but there are plenty of better options for low latency gaming.
I am a fan of Skullcandy gaming products for many years, so I was very happy that these performed totally up to my expectations.First the fit, extremely comfortable, the memory foam is super soft and large enough to comfortably cover my dumbo ears, one of the more comfortable headsets I have ever tried on. They are extremely easy to setup, I used Bluetooth and connected them flawlessly to my PC. I tested them out with music first, wow, sounded awesome, great clarity and bass and nice volume level. Now for the important part, gaming, I tested them with a quick game of COD (Call of Duty) and was very happy with the results, the spatial sound worked well, I was able to hone in on the enemies by their footsteps, worked great, and I read that it will even get better if I used their app, will have to try that next.Final thoughts:Skullcandy does it again, solid headset with extreme comfort and great sound... can't wait for my next gaming session.
Bought these for my husband to use with his XBox etc. after I got the SLYR Pro for myself and he kept borrowing them. He loves over-the-ear headsets and the elastic headband is more comfortable than the squishy cushion on the SLYR. The ear pieces are nice and large, instead of hard foam they‚Äôre a more squishy soft mesh material. He has some hearing loss and using the SkullCandy mobile app, he customized the output to his individual needs; he no longer needs to use the visual cues for hearing impaired on FortNite, for instance. He also likes muting the mic with the press of the ear piece vs switching the mic up and down. Make sure to read the guide to get the most out of them, 10/10 would buy again!
This is the first time I've used Skull Candy headset. So far we've used them for music via bluetooth and connected to the laptop. The sound is so good and they feel very comfortable on.
Got myself a pair to see how they were so far so good headphones are very comfortable and sound is pretty good with gaming an just normal audio compared to my logitech g733 headphones its even better with the skull candy software allowing to edit sound profiles haven't had any issue's with connectivity using wireless all an all for me great pair of headphones

I upgraded from the HyperX Cloud gaming headset - And this is a whole 'nother level of quality.From the feature packed software to the physical experience wearing the headset. Everything feels premium and sounds great.The biggest pro AND con may be the 360 spacial sound:While helping to create an extraordinarily immersive gaming experience, it can also be very distracting when it is not working perfectly. JBL has included an on-the-fly calibration switch so that it isn't a huge problem, but its still a small problem
6/3/20 - Amazon corrected the incorrect name of this item, so they are no longer listed as "wireless". This incorrect description was the main reason for the 1 star overall review. Now that it is corrected, I have amended my review of the headset to 4 stars. The reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because, well honestly for the main reason the price is high for a set that is wired. The other issue I found in my short time of using them is that the software/control panel for the LED lights is a little difficult to get the hang of. Could use an easier interface for editing the color and movement.To keep this review short, I just wanted to point out to potential buyers that the name of the item is: JBL Quantum ONE - Wireless Over-Ear Performance Gaming Headset with Active Noise Cancelling.... HOWEVER they are NOT wireless. I reported this mistake to Amazon over 1 week ago and it is still listed as Wireless. 1 of the main reasons I purchased this headset was purely because they were wireless. So hopefully you will see this review before you complete your purchase if you are looking for a wireless headset. They do have good sound, comfort and noise cancellation from the few minutes that I tested them. I did not pay close enough attention when unpacking them to realize it before opening them. I plugged them in and used them in what I thought was their wireless ability to hear them while I assumed they were charging and configuring the profiles via the software. It was later in the 1st evening that I thought I was loosing my mind trying to find how to pair them with my PC and phone etc. So if you purchased them as I did without reading this review first, you're not the only one who made the mistake. I also found it interesting that I do not think there is another review that points this out. I read some of the reviews before hand and didn't notice that it wasn't mentioned. I saw a few mention that if you wanted to customize the LED lighting, you had to do it through the JBL software. So I assumed that I would configure the lighting and EQ there, and it would stay the same when pairing and using them with another device.Come on JBL and Amazon, "Wireless" is literally the 4th word in the product name. That's a pretty big mistake on both companies. Fortunately Amazon still has a fantastic return policy and makes it very easy to return them. This will not cause me to stop trusting Amazon or JBL in the future. Both fantastic companies. I have 2 Studio 312's, 2 studio subs and a studio center channel that have all lasted over 18 years and are fantastic speakers so when I saw what I thought was a wireless gaming headset, it made sense that I would think they would serve me very well. So do not take my review as a statement of not recommending both companies. Far from it. Just a mistake that unfortunately fell through the cracks on both sides, creator and seller.
Y‚Äôall, I bought these for my bf & I honestly kind of regret it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, they are great quality but this man be screammmmin into the mic because he can‚Äôt hear himself, but the rest of us can üòÖ.
Great Headphones but MisleadingAll images of this product tend to show it without any wires.  This is a WIRED headset.  The other wired headsets in the lineup show the wires.  This is not wireless and it isn't claiming to be but the photos on every website suggest it is.  They sound really good but its frustrating that I decided to splurge on the next model up from the Quantum 800s only to find that the top of the line headset isn't wireless like the 800s.Get the Quantum 800 if you want quality wireless duplex (two way mic and speaker).  These are cool only if you want their spatial sound which is like virtual surround sound... Like if you're playing a game and footsteps are directly behind you and you turn you head 90 degrees left - the headset moves the sound stage such that the footsteps are now directly in line with - to the left of your left ear.  Its pretty cool.To put another way... its like being in a room with surround sound.  You turn your head and sound is still coming from the appropriate direction... because the speakers don't follow you.
I love this. I did have an issue with low volume when I first started to use them. You will need to download the JBL QuantumENGINE. In this you will find a way to upgrade the Firmware. Once that was done, the sound was corrected. Awesome quality which is what I expect when purchasing something of this price range.
After looking for some headphones for gaming and laptop use, I arrived to this pair. The aesthetics got my attention, from the size of the drivers (50mm with a frequency range of 20Hz-40KHz), to the customizable lighting effects that surround the outside of the drivers and the logo.Sound performance:The noise cancellation increases the feel of the bass on lower frequency‚Äôs, but does not diminish the higher frequency sounds. While playing Streets of Rage 4, I was able to appreciate more the ambient sound as you walk through the city and sewer levels. In comparison to B&W CM5 that I use for speakers the Quantum One‚Äôs had a better mid range, but it‚Äôs to be expected from headphones as larger speakers and separate subwoofer dull out some of the mid range.The microphone was clear and crisp to the other players. And did not pick up any ambient sound.Comfort:The headphones never felt heavy (369g) even after 3 hours of online matches. The size of the band and pressure by the cushions was not noticeable. Only on the first use did the tips of my ears feel some soreness, but after adjusting the placement there were no issues.Downside is that you need to plug in the usb (C-A) in order to fully run the drivers. When using only the 3.5mm connection there was not enough power to the drivers and you don‚Äôt get the light effects surrounding the outside of the drivers. This just made for a lot of cables when playing with a controller or an arcade stick. Since this pair of headphones are closed off there is small amount of heat that you feel in your ear canal. In my experience this is mainly do to the higher volumes and not from the material. I‚Äôve used Shure SHR750DJ open headphones that didn‚Äôt cause this problem since they‚Äôre open, but in my Shure SE400 I could feel some heat inside the ear after long music listening sessions. The Quantum One‚Äôs didn‚Äôt cause any kind of sweat or heat on the outer part of the ear.If you want a solid pair of gaming headphones, I don‚Äôt think you can go wrong with this pair. Just understand the cable management when using consoles, and that you‚Äôll need a pc to customize the lighting effects.
First of all, it was impossible to get a good answer about whether or not the noise cancellation would work with a mac, or what features would be available. So for other mac users out there, basically everything works fine, including the dual chat/game output channels, over usb. you do not need to use the 3.5mm jack for any part.I returned this item because the ANC (active noise cancellation) was very weak. some frequencies it blocked very well, but compared to something like my 1st gen airpods pro, the ANC is practically un-noticeable. This would probably be fine for gaming, but not good if you are trying to cut distractions from your ears.
I love these gaming headphones. Biggest plus for me was the cross-platform capabilities, being able to use it on my mobile, console, PC, and VR. Got these during the Black Friday sale and I gotta say these are great sets of a headphones. They‚Äôre sleek and comfortable, and comes with so many options. Aesthetically, the light show is a blast. The Quantum driver interface lets you customize almost everything. There‚Äôs a light setting where you can adjust the sequence, duration, and color of the lights on the different parts of the headset. You can also adjust the sound quality with the equalizer settings and the different styles of active noise cancelling and spacial audio. Honestly, it got kind of surreal with the QuantumSpace setting on. While on chats, it sounds as though we are in the same room. Coming with the audio dial, it is a little bulky, but it does make it easier to adjust the volume balance between different platforms (gaming, chat, etc). The aux adapter also makes it possible to use on mobile devices and console too. A huge drawback though is apparently, there‚Äôs no driver version for Macbooks so there‚Äôs no access to all the customizations since they had to be done through the driver software. I didn‚Äôt use this headset to try and game on a Mac, just tried to use it while doing work and found out I couldn‚Äôt get into the software. But overall, it‚Äôs a great headset with amazing sound and options. I was planning on getting a pair of these even before Black Friday and I‚Äôd still get a pair even if there wasn‚Äôt a discount. But since I can‚Äôt adjust it sound quality on Mac‚Äôs, it‚Äôs a big inconvenience when trying to switch to different platforms.
They starts hurting over short periods of time. They look pretty cool though.
I'm not sure what all these other folks with mediocre reviews are griping about with these headphones. I've been around audio for the last 30 years and these things are dang near perfect for the audiophile tweaker, gamer, casual listener, Zoomer, etc. It could be the honeymoon phase, but I don't think so. I got them for the half price deal, (week of 11/23/20) and I've used them non-stop for the last few days and I've found very little to complain about.The current version of the JBL QuantumENGINE app seems VG so far for me. The spatial sounds and DTS modes work well, and even with all those bells and whistles turned off these are solid sounding headphones and would be hard to beat. I've had a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50Xs for the past couple years and straight up L/R these JBLs keep pace with the ATs. I ordered some HyperX and Razer models along side because I wanted to be able to do a true comparison, and I'm here to tell you there is no contest. JBL's hands down.They are pretty comfortable and I'm more of an earbud guy vs an over-the-ear. The mic is a little short, I'd prefer one less spongy and more tactile; Durability, who knows time will tell, they are 100% plastic; I would have made the other end of the cord USB-C if I were JBL and just included an adapter, but I understand why they did it the way they did; If I were stretching, I'd of wanted there a way to allow them to be used wirelessly too.Anyway, we'll see if my opinion changes after using them for some time but I was compelled to review and defend these headphones from the haters. Now I will concede, I probably wouldn't have hit the buy button at $300 so I'll give the haters that much. Peace!

Panasonic makes the best on-ear wired old-style headphones. Sound quality is the best
para el precio buen producto
My wife loves these over-the-ear headphones but inevitably breaks them by sleeping on them or whatever. The sound is pretty good but they are not the most robust physical construction. Anyway, buying them by the 5-pack saves money and keeps spares on-hand.
these were the best sound of headsets that were comfortable to fall asleep on.
Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS is the Best headphones on the market in 2021. I have been using these for several years now. The five pack is great because you never know when one will get damaged. These headphones are excellent for listening to high quality music and for composing music. The Frequency Response is 16Hz - 22kHz. This is the frequency response you need. You could also buy headphones with a frequency response of 12Hz - 26kHz. But Do Not buy headphones with a frequency response of 20Hz - 20kHz unless all you want to hear is bass. I highly recommend these headphones not only because of the low price but also because of the excellent quality and frequency response.
I have been ordering these for years.  I usually don't buy so many but this was a good deal. they usually last a year.  very lightweight and comfortable.
Audio from tablet and laptop with fan blowing in my face.
Item Description: set of 5 basic headphones.Pros: comfortable. quality sound for affordable price & low enough profile for me to use while falling asleep with my head on a pillow watching a movie.Cons: none unless you are a sound snob. I once spoke with an owner of a vintage vinyl record shop & they said that unless you have hyper-sensitive hearing, most sound quality claims by any speaker manufacturer is mostly nonsense.Suggestions to manufacture: noneWould I buy again or as a gift? yesDid I receive anything for this review? NO! I paid full price for this item.
Great price
My family if very rough on headphones -- they are frequently packed down into backpacks, taken on numerous trips, and in use most of the day.  For me, a pair of these lasts me years and I find them very comfortable, so I keep a set at my desk at both work and at home.We've used cheaper headphones, but many of them don't last a week. And I stay away from earbuds because of concerns around them regarding hearing loss.These last a fair amount of time and aren't expensive. I just order a box and when I run out, order another box.
