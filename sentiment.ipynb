And, they're better overall, soundstage, speed, bass depth, bass extension, resolution, etc. people like open headphone sound. That's perfectly fine, that's case, probably like these. owned open headphone like open airy spacious natural sound... ADORE these.Comfort: 4.5 stars. They're Sennheisers. Pretty much Sennheisers extremely comfortable. They're light. pad usually comfortable soft velour. usually medium light light clamping force. really large oval cup fit largest ears. comfort high list, might fit bill.Value: 5 stars. headphone bat outside league.

Actually, also can't use Bluetooth / noise cancellation even process charging headphones\\u2026 (see \\\"gripes\\\" towards end review).. guess good Sony decided bestow quick-charge 5-hour use time 10-minute charge function (using wall receptacle USB adapter course).Basically work energized battery headphone use noise cancellation Bluetooth connection - also serf activate right ear cup touch-pad perform function headset.If energized battery decide use direct 3.5mm headphone cable connect phone computer instead, still use noise cancellation, touch-pad available utilize cord take Bluetooth serve music (and depends upon Bluetooth connection \\\"talk\\\" paired device functions, touch-pad disabled).If depleted battery cannot use noise cancellation touch-pad still get sound like regular pair headphone using 3.5mm cable plugged phone computer.The connectivity Bluetooth seems really robust. one minor issue since owning sound listening hiccupped fraction second couple times, think phone behaving moment headphone causing problem.

AKG: 1.Packaging:The AKG come two cable carrying case. cable green high quality. long portable use. cable easy connect disconnect plus times, cable failing rest. Since headphone meant portable use, carrying case really necessary.The DT880 come one cable removable. also bit long portable use. also come huge carrying case. like sure protect way bulky thinking using travel.Conclusion: DT880 : 0.

Tons X2HR forums, reviews, videos, etc., HD599se much. wanted open back headphone, primarily games, secondary music movies.I almost decided keep headphone hard choose. difference first:- X2HR heavy me. thought matter. comfy get heavy soon noticeable.- X2HR definitely boomier bass. Think deep rich smooth.- HD599se, super comfy, probably comfy headphone. Ears get hot sweaty like Sony ANC headphones. wear hour others kind need take breaks.The first headphone opened X2HR. First song Paul Taylor's Push Start. almost cried, think I've experienced wide sound stage before. Deep bass open audio experience like other. like listening song knew different way. Everything sounded great. listened Paul Taylor, Tobu, Axero, etc. Yeah there's awesome bass.Then contain try HD599se. First underwhelmed. wide, actually felt almost like closed back headphones. surprised hear bass, worried would non-existent. bass, much X2HR. tried PS4 controller. loud enough issue here.Two day later tried again, put HD599se first listened. actually really good, bad remembered. put X2HR. noticed difference clearer. Jazz, sax much clearer cleaner. Guitars sound beautiful. much balanced, neutral, everything presented well. X2HR, bass cloud instruments, pronounced feel.Ultimately, listening music tobu, axero, gramatik, jack johnson, nora jones, paul taylor, haywyre, etc., playing ps4, really wanted keep different purpose. end chose one knew I'd use one time. Here's chose Sennheiser HD599se:- Audio balanced, easy listen genres. like bass overwhelm everything. Everything pretty much level. instrument sound much clearer. like artist want bass song, definitely notice it. seems match artist probably wanted hear.- know burn-in happened, exactly is, time feel like bass audio quality HD599se got significantly better. maybe sound better PC phone, that's notice it.- Hip hop, jazz, blues, etc pleasure. edm sounded better X2hr me.- Gaming much enjoyable HD599se. FPS like call duty, could hear surroundings better anticipate people around me. sport games, felt like crowd noise overwhelming X2hr, FIFA.- Super comfortable light.- spend alot time already listening music HD599se really good. appreciate listen music. I'm analyzing, listening thing.In closing, wish could keep both. won't. wish Sennheiser little bass, enough. hear boom, bass hum, usual, much rich X2HR. wish HD599se wider soundstage, X2hr had. Really like openness... alot. like lot bass mind sacrifice audio instrument sax, piano, guitar, ok heavier headphone, X2HR amazing. went back forth much two, hard pick. really listen alot. end I'm really happy decision awesome black friday price.

I'm audiophile, that's layman's impression difference. switch rapidly back forth two set can listen favorite track, certainly notice sound different. listen whole track twice (once set cans), hard pressed find qualitative variation.The comfort: exhaustively documented Achilles heel cans. Many user report headband tight pad uncomfortable, either getting sweaty clamping tightly around ears. know head compare yours, find quite comfortable. fully prepared buy leather headband people often use (here: http://www.amazon.com/Replacement-Leatherette-Universal-Sennheiser-Beyerdynamic/dp/B00862522A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1391096262&sr=8-1&keywords=leather+band+headphones), found need it. pressure stock headband slightly get M50, notice uncomfortable pressure point anywhere. upgrade Beyerdynamic velour pad (EDT-250) everyone loves, mostly wanted try them. definitely comfortable stock ones, that's going case can vinyl/pleather pads.The great thing phone detachable cable.

Meaning already paired phone, want use laptop completely go pairing process again. paired laptop want go back phone, pair everything again. really can't believe Sony botched feature badly, really know thinking.A minor negative Sony headphone app compatible Android Chromebooks.

There's simply way turn off. Sony dedicated hardware power button, well multi-function button setup (via app) control ANC digital assistants, etc. far problem accidentally activating touch function. Volume, skip, pause touch function responsive.(7) Although I'm using included case (I bought 3rd-party case like better), still really nice case. think Bose case nicer, Sennheiser case pathetic much better bag term protecting rather expensive headphones.Overall, without getting many specific two headphones, rate Sony headphone best me. slightly beat Bose QC35-II headphone term ANC well sound quality, there's simply comparison come Sony's touch control superior USB-C charging. difference Sony headphone Sennheiser PXC550 headphone like night day.

They're gonna sound awful. father-in-law-to-be hand sends recording garage band, grab however awful set backup can need sound good. tell truth. Yet, good recording, shockingly flattering. put garbage in, get garbage out. Give something good, though, get magic. I've listened entire music library these, recording particular really demonstrate well shine:-In Air Tonight (Phil Collins, Face Value, 1981): decent-to-good set headphones, song sound ominous; sound cool. Whatever. HD600s, religious experience. Sounds swirl around head. crescendo diminuendo blow away. vocal sound perfect. Incredible.-In Eyes (Peter Gabriel, So, 1986): entire album fabulous. Listen again. there's reason song singled out. sibilance nightmare. MDR-V6s, unlistenable moderate volume. Enter HD600s: there's hiding much sibilance is, handle gracefully possible.Enough ink spilled handle classical jazz (spoiler: fabulously), vocal presentation particular spot-on.THE STUFF NEED:To get brilliant sound, going need things. First foremost amp. get crazy pretty quick, first let's draw distinction: solid state v tubes. HD600 high enough impedance really get along OTL amp (ie, headphone tube amps). color sound somewhat, get hot, unreliable, need warm up, etc. want go road, can. There's also lot really expensive solid state amps.Or, could get Schiit Magni JDS Objective2, sound... well... perfect.Next, need think DAC. Now, lot people assume they'll need one. may case. Retina Macbook Pro, instance, skip it. never hear difference whatever get 150 bucks. deal plugging (good) CD player receiver whatever straight amp. source something else, like midrange PC, need evaluate yourself. Unfortunately, can't help that.If decide need DAC, lot expensive option there.Or, could get Schiit Modi JDS ODAC, sound... well... perfect.(Side lesson: internet audiophile community fight back forth time whether O2/ODAC Magni/Modi better setup. Realistically, performance nearly identical. Buy whichever think look better.)(Another side lesson: seriously probably need spend ton money DACs amps. O2/ODAC designed wacky internet crusader wanted prove performance Benchmark DAC2 HPA2 could achieved without spending thousand dollars. engineering perspective, obviously possible. look further, still find people insist O2/ODAC sound good significantly expensive gear. remember audiophile crazies, think need 192kHz recording Nyquist-Shannon apply special snowflakes. two important thing digital-to-analog system input file transducer.)Finally, going need good recordings. iTunes sufficient. Vinyl pretty good (repeat me: vinyl sound better CD, objectively worse, record sound great 25 times, equal CD never). CD best bet, particularly mastered \\\"loudness wars\\\" started late 1990s. However, world perfect; fear not, Senns still sound good stuff compressed dynamic range (within reason).

'dream' headphone since beginning audiophile journey. One never thought I'd ever buy back then. also one headphone learned sonic quality wanted headphone, think would personally like. bought month year ago, I'm sure would've liked them. tend prefer bright, aggressive, bass treble-centric headphone. HD650 known opposite. Dark/warm, relaxed, smooth, dulled treble response. see adamant ever giving chance.It recently wanted venture look something little different normal preferences. alternative I'd use whenever wanted sit back, enjoy soothing sound, forward mids/vocals could watch TV shows, movies, anime with. Ironically, secondary considerably expensive main (DT990s) time. Lol, Head-fi logic. Well, went took plunge, hoping best, expecting worst. thought would hate them. Really. experiment would cost me, one needed point, HD650 always ONE headphone always curious (more other).So happened? like them? Hate them? surprise... loved music, movies, TV, anime, liked thrilled gaming. Let's get sound.Bass: lows. Well, surprising. actually pretty bassy. DT990 bassy, nice, full, bassy sound. I'd say DT880 990 presence. warm bass, medium speed. Pretty much ideal all-rounder headphone good bass would please like balance fun signature. bass quantity enjoyable crowds, unless pure neutral-head pure bass-head. find wanting bass, though roll sub-bass, typical dynamic headphones, something HE-400 problem with.If could score bass, it'd be; Quantity: 7.5, Quality: 8. really pleasing bass around.Mids: star show. say star... mean, absolutely one best interpretation mids/vocals EVER heard headphone...EVER. I'm usually fine mid recession tend prefer bass treble emphasis, MAN... heard HD650... made see mids whole new light. vocal sweet, upfront, rich, haunting! Based mids alone, recommend headphone ANYONE looking headphone vocal amazing justice. headphone provides really sweet mids I've heard Audio Technica ESW9, ESW9 closed ear, considerably smaller soundstage, overly smooth treble, stuffy sound signature comparison. ESW9 good, HD650 good.The HD598 also forward mids, felt lean bass, thinner sound, made mids sound unnaturally forward shouty. warmth fullness HD650 basically destroyed chance HD598 direct comparison. competition. HD650's mids demolish HD598's tone, realism, richness. HE400 often compared HD650, despite preference HE400, HD650 clearly king mids here. HE400 great, INTEGRATED mids, sound pushed back forward realistic tone. said, HD650's forward mids special. HD650 clearly win here. far Q701 HD650's mids, HD650 win again. Q701 forward mids, nearly full sounding, rich.Long story shot, mids godly. score them: Quantity: 10, Quality: 10. perfection, that's feel HD650's mids.Treble: Oh treble. single-handedly reason put getting HD650 long. read HD650, treble always discussed debated on. smooth, rolled off, undetailed... veiled? debate never end Head-fi. fan treble sparkle emphasis, absolutely mortified hearing people said HD650's smooth, laid back, dull, treble.So sound me? Surprisingly, REALLY liked treble! LOVE it. still prefer sparkle, relaxing alternative typical treble emphasized headphones, find treble overly smooth dull HD650. Trust me, main DT990 known SUPER treble emphasis, compare directly much reserved rolled treble HD650, would tend notice huge difference. honestly, really thought treble HD650s right type headphone HD650 is. Without treble, think HD650 sound rich 'creamy' do. Would use HD650s headphone? frank, no. performed well absolutely everything except genre desired aggressive signature. Stuff like metal, EDM energy HD650s. no, perfect rounders. However, vocal dependent tracks, stuff like movies, TV, non-music need (even gaming), HD650s indeed good place. Unfortunately, tend listen EDM metal anything, HD650 lost points.To score treble; Quality: 7, Quantity: 7. treble boosted bit, could I'd consider natural neutral slight emphasis towards bass. think they'd le rich overall though, personally want touch make HD650 are.Amping: HD650 paired Audio-GD SA-31 much powerful pretty much amp use, would use, I'm exactly sure they'd sound le power, personally felt hard drive people make be. need considerably le power DT990/600, possibly even DT990/250. I'd say they'd need much DT990/32 LEAST volume level. know power =/= volume, helps. clear: need lot driven LOUDLY. tested Mixamp only, driven loud enough. test enough see well they're actually driven, sounded good. may little thinner sounding, could actually good thing gaming, make pinpointing sound bit easier rich, thick signature HD650s SA-31.Okay, perform gaming?---START GAMER SECTION---Soundstage: gotten specific gaming HD650s yet, I'll mention soundstage first. without extra amping Mixamp, felt HD650's soundstage medium sized. big, little. However, find stellar term depth, sense space gaming, good would hoped. always expecting HD650 greatest pairing Dolby Headphone, fear slightly warranted. front/back depth great. Let's get way. width good, close best. DT990 destroys HD650 depth width. how's air within soundstage? Well, problem HD650, full sounding headphone. Thick, warm tone tends make soundstage seems le airy smaller. one time thinner/leaner sounding headphone advantage, like AD700/HD598/K701. HD650 STUFFY like say ESW9, rich tonality help gamers.Positioning: Positioning soundstage tend go hand hand, soundstage great, positional cue suffer. HD650 fare positional-wise? Well, good. great, could obviously better, job. could play something like Black Ops without problems, though used headphone much better soundstage/positioning, could tell lacked bit. I'd put HD650 ever slightly DT880 positional wise, much better.Clarity: need clarity soundwhoring competitive gaming. Despite laid back treble, found natural tone HD650 detailed. forward mids came clean clear, felt miss sounds. I've heard better overall (even 990's better soundwhoring). problem HD650 thick sounding headphone. Basically, issue explained soundstage section hurt clarity gaming purposes.---END GAMER SECTION---Comfort: mentioned Sennheiser like clamp. HD201, HD280 Pro (!), PC360, HD598 form clamp. HD650 different. clamp bit I'd personally like, minor gripe overall. find HD650 comfortable overall, extending arm little, wear HD650 slightly loose alleviates clamp bit. I've felt better, much better. velour great. firm, soft. cup huge fit ear comfortably. like oval shape, make easier use laying compared circular cups.Value: Sennheiser HD650 considerably expensive headphone. main purpose getting headphone gaming, considerably better option less. pure audio fidelity, non-gaming purpose main purpose, HD650 incredibly hard beat. sound signature stellar things, save genres, they're competent gaming, stellar. personally can't justify owning HD650 HE-400, stuck HE-400 energetic, better equipped gaming use.Final Impressions: HD650 special place heart. took year finally take plunge, I'm glad did. quickly become one favorite headphones. Though gaming performance stellar would hoped, better expected. absolutely love HD650 overall, made see importance mids, even non-gaming, non-music use. Movies TV show made HD650. incredible tonality, rich/full sound, perfect mids absolute blessing. Treble definitely weakest aspect sound, veiled, just...reserved.For gamers looking all-rounders, put fight. They're better vast majority headphone mentioned guide term audio fidelity, raw performance gaming, they're outclassed others costing considerably less.\",\"got pair portable use noisy places.

Similarly, midrange 700's stand out, lack little detail separation get 900's. Essentially, 900's accurate across whole range sound, whereas 700's dynamic sounding expense little subtlety.I still love 700's. listened mainly modern pop/dance music think would better choice. However, 900's definitely better across whole range music types. would also say difference I'm talking night day here. 700's still mighty impressive money, 900's ultimately offer bit accuracy music demand it.\",\"high quality set headphone audio quality, two drawback thin cords, mic.I love headphones, I've using long time. one pair used TWO FULL YEARS broke. honestly fault, jack exploded dropping device it(genuinely clumsy, jack little bit durable that).The PICTURES displayed show nice folding design, careful cords. little much tugging cause problem mic.

Sony's provide fun full listening experience wide array music genre make perfectly content purchase. Bose's QC headphone provde refined pleasent listening experience especially discerning listener provide stronger noise cancelling performance home office setting. stronger sound signature Sony hold better lounder atmosphere plane, train, automobile stronger bass performance. Sony's lack grace balance QCs, provide familiar experience majority listener appeal someone like sound Apple's Beats, looking professional subtle design.Full Review:For Sony WH-1000XM3 ($350), primarily compare Bose Quiet Comfort (QC)($350) since even though relative price range, technically closer price age. also provide little comparison Bose's NC700 ($400) Sennheiser's Momentum ($400) summary. Also, primarily discus pair headphone question relates feature-wise Bose's Quiet Comfort (not QCII) headphone refraining giving many detail others, since read specifically pair individually review posted respective products. reason mainly keep review becoming master's thesis subjective preferences. :)Initial Impression:Starting packaging. Simple straight forward. outer shell nice texture it, sliding insert headphone reveals simple package structure made case holding headphone inside box. However, case feel really nice sleek color palette. appealing feel look opinion. Although case touch bigger one Bose's QC, better job holding headphones. QC's case always feel uncomfortably tight putting away. Sony's case neatly hold everything comfortably (without squish zip closed). case stiff, really hard. inside QCs soft microfiber feel it. headphone fold inside three little slot right (inside outside) airplane adapter, 3.5mm aux cord, USB Type-C charger cable.The Headphones:When first picked case, felt nice. Soft plastic good feel them. plastic sparkle matte finish resists fingerprinting decently. band leatherette top soft good cushion. Similarly around ear cups. soft nice touch. stiff QCs. click band expanding satisfyingly stiff. top ear cups, see one microphone rose gold finish. smaller hole hidden around subtly NC array. feel minor plus Sonys. QC's microphone little prominent pick wind lot outside. USB Type-C port bottom right cup indicator light. left cup power button along bottom back button toggling noise cancelling level it. Inside ear cups, microfiber layer covering driver layer foam. Overall Sony's feel little lighter QC's also feel slightly flimsy handling them. design also appealing fluid frankly premium.When comparing headphone putting on, QC feel snug naturally isolating turning on. cup feel like form better seal given stiffer cover QC also angled driver leave natural room ear inside cup, making headphone feel like sitting ears, rather around them. Sony mean uncomfortable, may tend le comfortable longer wear time might make ear prone getting hotter.Sound Quality:For starter section, compare noise cancelling. Upon turning Sonys on, greeted woman's voice sound like tin cave speaks. NC kick in, darn good job removing ambient sound muffling people talking somewhat. feel close NC QCs, would still give leg Sonys much noticeable white noise factor playing whereas QC feel like sucked sound atmosphere around you. traveling folk (I primarily wear typical office setting work plenty well for), would say given aggressive, forward, pronounced sound stage Sonys, find blocking sound better car plane without sound (especially lower, bass end) washed out. QCs better NC, sound softer general sound still get overwhelmed car/plane. saying NC job, left weaker QCs sound subtler refined turn louder make this.Now, difficult judge sound since subjective, try give impression headphone may better for. listen wide range genres, appreciate many style music represented different type headphone speakers. First, Sonys bring forward sound. sound stage wide QCs. Instruments get mixed together lost fray. sound Sonys feel akin Beats Studio. bass pronounced punchy may appealing some. prefer balanced clean representation, QCs serve better. turn volume up, Sonys also lose balance become muddy. QCs give impression music playing around you, Sonys feel like they're playing music. (if really want feel like stage music, Sennheiser's HD800S king. HD700 HD660S good job better price, studio headphones, totally different use case begin with.)Where really felt performance shining came Rap, R&B, even EDM/House area. definitely appreciate Sony 2pac, Destiny's Child, Infected Mushroom, Daft Punk. little aggressive music may want finer touch jazz opera. listening Kenny G, David Benoit, Keiko Matsui, get groove, fine detail intricacy instrument sacrificed. Also, sharp trill piano key saxophone bit much higher volumes. visceral in-your-face nature sound also make pretty fun band vein Disturbed, Five Finger Death Punch, Pantera, Metallica. Going bit direction, like Eluveitie Slayer likely give headache unsubdued high thrashing sounds. Taking couple step back going classic rock like Eagles, Journey, Gerry Rafferty, etc., QC perform better, fine Sony's headphones. Finally, listening music gentler atmosphere like Norah Jones, Ray LaMontagne, Ludovico Einaudi, Celtic Woman, would give Bose's QCs Sony liven bit way.Features:Both Sony QC three level NC. High, Ambient sounds, off. QC handle lot better. mid level Sony feel worthless clumsy without audio playing. almost sound better turned off. QC, mid level provides good balance allows wear outside windy day reduced noise wind NC microphone. However, case QC (instead QCII), need app change NC level.The QC claim 20 hour battery, thoroughly proven true year owned them. Sony's claim 30 hours, also found true, nearly long see hold time. Also QCs longer, replace ear pad 2 years. process easy made feel sound new better seal fresh pads. process headphone appears same.Call quality great headphones. also use Skype call laptop work work great. However, one place Sony completely dropped ball. Bose's QCs allow two device connected time, switch seamlessly make great office. laptop phone time. listen music working. meeting time, join Skype call immediately pick up. get call phone, switch back over. done, music ready go. touch anything. Next time turn on, pick backup laptop phone immediately.Both charge fast. minute give couple hour use pinch. also apps. Bose app laid better useful, neither really great even necessary except case Bose able sync two pair Bose headphone play music audio both. may good deal couple seeking watch movie plane something. done couple time work well setup. nice feature favor Bose, really found lot use reality.For Sonys, feature right cup touch controls. fairly slick work better expected. took couple attempt get hang responsive. Swipe volume. Swipe left right skipping tracks. Double tap play pause. finally, hold finger right ear cup, turn volume turn external microphone catch ambient sound need talk someone really quick without stopping music. nice feature, personally found much use it. Might useful people bigger city like NYC walking around headphone constantly want take every time need listen moment.Conclusion:Sony's WH-1000XM3 slouch stand price range. someone looking pair headphone solid noise cancelling, flexible diverse performance across genre premium features, go wrong these. dock 4/5 star simply opinion, fall short Bose's QC series price range overall quality balance sound, noise cancellation ability, ability connect two device seamlessly hand extremely handy business people today's multi-device world. Now, brief mention slightly expensive option Bose NC700 Sennheiser Momentum. willing step bit $400 mark, get even better quality, better noise cancelation, premium feel overall better devices. However, propose Sony Bose QCs, would go wrong. majority people, would say extra money worth marginal increase headphones. mostly come preference sound.I try keep review updated time go anything come up.

Sony problem initially, started loosening headband much possible, light pair, stopped particular issue. found Sony much comfortable 700. could see folk saying comfortable Momentum 4s. However disagree that. Momentum 4 comfortable. soft ear pads, much like Sony. Granted M4s heavier, weight distributed well across headband, better Sony's imo. all, close call Sony's really well done comfort wise. Super light super cushy pads. Could see reasonable person going either direction win here.Sound quality:I think XM5 pretty close Bose 700 could see folk going either way depending signature preferences. Personally think like Sony bit better, lively neutral Bose. league though. M4s way better sound quality wise plain simple. They're league. Heck, they're even playing sport. Find listening music way often day simply enjoy much more. reason I'm ultimately sticking M4s. hard decision.Noise cancelation:Sony XM5 simply best. buying headphone block sound partner playing annoying tiktok vids, one get. M4s pretty good noise canceling too, Sony's way better imo. Bose sits XM5 M4s, maybe little better M4sMic sound quality:I'm work remotely multiple meeting throughout day I've done extensive testing three models. nutshell special requirements, great job. quiet condition prefer M4 little better others, voice body it, again, plenty clear using models. noisy conditions, Sony XM5 way better rest isolating voice minimizing background noise. Simply incredible! 700 M4 handled background noise bit differently. voice clearer M4s noisy condition whereas Bose cancel background noise cost sacrificing clarity. there's lot noise, Bose reduce voice point super difficult hear saying. M4s allow background noise through, voice remains super clear louder sound coming through.One feature really like M4s, one button (making super easy find) becomes mute button calls, zoom google meetings. Really enjoy feature could walk around house unmute need talk. voice tell muted unmuted know at. flushing toilet running room hoping no-one meeting heard it.The background noise canceling XM5 call good, made really want keep them. ultimately good music sound quality something I'd enjoy often since I'm often taking meeting super noisy conditions. Also M4s mute button could use find situation.Summery:If want incredible noise cancelation listening music, taking call meetings, Sony XM5 one get. head shoulder competition respect. wanna wowed amazing music sounds, renewing love music even know had, M4s you. main area substantial difference. Sony Seinheiser truly impressed respective area expertise. Aside standout areas, great headsets. Even Bose 700 really solid headset. Unfortunately able differentiate compared two titan industry. Noise canceling great, can't touch Sony's. Sound quality also great, can't touch M4s. Arguable Bose slickest looking headset bunch though.\",\"Panasonic make best on-ear wired old-style headphones.

Ultimately, understand there's debate whether Sony Bose better. fantastic headphone love both. love much, made probably financially irresponsible decision keep both! good, better completely unique ways. reason, dealbreaker make one better -- believe come completely personal preference that's much debate better.The TL;DR review buy Sony value sound quality most, plan wear long period time (i.e. 5-6 hour per session). buy Bose value comfort most, planning use phone calls.If interested bit detail, I'll give opinion aspects: ANC, Sound, Comfort, VersatilityANCThe noise-cancelling phenomenal. assumed Bose would better since they're known for, I'm surprised say Sony's ANC slightly better. bit better blocking non-drone sound (i.e. people talking, sharp noises, etc) compared Bose. said, practically equal think Sony ANC much better Bose would justify buying factor alone. wearing either pair, sometimes feel like spaceman walking around apartment everything quiet.SOUNDThis clear winner Sony. question asked, sound clearer, crisper, deeper. especially noticeable watching movies/TV show playing video games. Sony, feel like hear individual sound clearly, whereas Bose everything little muddled together. said, Bose sound perfectly acceptable even 'good'. $300 pair headphone I'd expect premium quality amazed clear sound is. Sony that; Bose tier below.COMFORTHands down, Bose better. literally wear 14 hour bother except needing give ear little air every while. never, ever worn pair headphone comfortable before. I'm especially grateful comfort I'm working home day COVID-19. Sony headphone bit heavier clamp head little bit tightly. also press ears, whereas Bose deep enough ear even touch inside cans. Sony still definitely comfortable, tier Bose. still wear 6 hour bother me, wear headphone long might problem you.VERSATILITYThis catch-all aspect headphones. Nothing would consider selling point strong enough people make final decision, specific need might helpful.1. like physical button Bose touch button Sony. work better, make mistake le often.2. Sony better technology. use USB-C headphone charge faster Bose mini-hdmi. also better bluetooth connection technology, let higher bitrate audio transfer wirelessly. Without getting technical, think major reason sound quality Sony better.3. Bose better want connect multiple devices. Bose connect two device simultaneously, Sony connect 1 device time. example, listening music computer get phone call, I'm wearing Bose, answer talk call headset, hang music resume. Sony, I'd either disconnect computer, reconnect phone call ended, take headphone completely answer phone separately.4. Sony look little stylish futuristic. Bose look like ordinary pair headphones. Build quality identical thoughCONCLUSION5 month buying these, regret keeping both? NO! absolutely worth money it. Generally, find wear Bose throughout day I'm working home. They're really comfortable wear day long, get call co-worker need take off, I'm listening music background noise work sound quality important. dinner, always Sony.

Definitely high quality pleasing. fact, described \\\"calming\\\". base heavy. main use headphone cut background noise listen relaxing music working/studying cafe. Therefore, keeping aim mind, sound quality right target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. cut outside noises. But, expect miracle people describe. example, somebody talks, definitely hear them. also slight pressure ear due ANC, got used pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. best one market term comfort. Especially compared Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, wearing hour so, ear still get warm level take while. surprise given positive review regarding comfort Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: mentioned reviews, Bose pick external noise phone calls. level prevent communication. However certainly disturbs party. Compared Plantronics, issue Plantronics. People could figure whether using headphone not. So, purchasing Bose day long phone call work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. know Sony many feature (touchpad control songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.) Bose. essential nice have. Especially quick attention mode. somebody talk wearing Bose, remove hassle. Plantronics, could handle situation without removing headphone. Another important feature multi-device connection simultaneously. one reason chose Sony. hoping connect laptop phone time. However feature working should. connect laptop phone try listen song laptop, play smoothly all. stop start every 3-5 second problem data transfer speed. 1-2 mins, laptop (Dell XPS 13) crash (it crashed 4 time within 30 mins). let tell this. using laptop last 2 years. crashed even now. also date; Windows & Dell driver update installed. Long story short, can't connect Bose laptop phone now. hope Bose solves firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, worse Plantronics. disconnect shorter distance Plantronics does, automatically reconnects get closer device Plantronics always without problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose good headphone flaw major weaknesses. far perfect many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. satisfied purchase, need decide feature headphone important main use. best sound quality call quality, want feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. hate it. care noise cancellation comfort clean sound, go it.I hope helps...\",\"Around holidays, decided treat pair high quality headphones. live central area major US city, frank noise pollution driving little crazy. interested pair headphone would give peace quiet, spent lot time looking ANC (active noise-Cancelling) option Sony WH1000MX3 Bose QuietComfort 35 II easily top pick among reviews.However, lot different opinion better. split pretty 50/50 Sony Bose, pretty torn. Even though heavily discounted holiday ($300 taxes), that's lot money considering generally never spend $50 headphones. bought experiment, plan return one made decision.Let get way now, I'm going get pretty detailed below. Ultimately, understand there's debate whether Sony Bose better. fantastic headphone love both. love much, made probably financially irresponsible decision keep both! good, better completely unique ways. reason, dealbreaker make one better -- believe come completely personal preference that's much debate better.The TL;DR review buy Sony value sound quality most, plan wear long period time (i.e. 5-6 hour per session). buy Bose value comfort most, planning use phone calls.If interested bit detail, I'll give opinion aspects: ANC, Sound, Comfort, VersatilityANCThe noise-cancelling phenomenal. assumed Bose would better since they're known for, I'm surprised say Sony's ANC slightly better. bit better blocking non-drone sound (i.e. people talking, sharp noises, etc) compared Bose. said, practically equal think Sony ANC much better Bose would justify buying factor alone. wearing either pair, sometimes feel like spaceman walking around apartment everything quiet.SOUNDThis clear winner Sony. question asked, sound clearer, crisper, deeper. especially noticeable watching movies/TV show playing video games. Sony, feel like hear individual sound clearly, whereas Bose everything little muddled together. said, Bose sound perfectly acceptable even 'good'. $300 pair headphone I'd expect premium quality amazed clear sound is. Sony that; Bose tier below.COMFORTHands down, Bose better. literally wear 14 hour bother except needing give ear little air every while. never, ever worn pair headphone comfortable before. I'm especially grateful comfort I'm working home day COVID-19. Sony headphone bit heavier clamp head little bit tightly. also press ears, whereas Bose deep enough ear even touch inside cans. Sony still definitely comfortable, tier Bose. still wear 6 hour bother me, wear headphone long might problem you.VERSATILITYThis catch-all aspect headphones. Nothing would consider selling point strong enough people make final decision, specific need might helpful.1. like physical button Bose touch button Sony. work better, make mistake le often.2. Sony better technology. use USB-C headphone charge faster Bose mini-hdmi. also better bluetooth connection technology, let higher bitrate audio transfer wirelessly. Without getting technical, think major reason sound quality Sony better.3. Bose better want connect multiple devices. Bose connect two device simultaneously, Sony connect 1 device time. example, listening music computer get phone call, I'm wearing Bose, answer talk call headset, hang music resume. Sony, I'd either disconnect computer, reconnect phone call ended, take headphone completely answer phone separately.4. Sony look little stylish futuristic. Bose look like ordinary pair headphones. Build quality identical thoughCONCLUSION5 month buying these, regret keeping both? NO! absolutely worth money it. Generally, find wear Bose throughout day I'm working home. They're really comfortable wear day long, get call co-worker need take off, I'm listening music background noise work sound quality important. dinner, always Sony. I'm focusing new album, watching movie, playing video game, really value good sound is. generally wear 3-4 hour point discomfort never issue.If twist arm made pick one pair rest life? I'd probably take Bose wear much working home. that's fair metric, individual different primary purpose guiding principal making choice.Good luck!

Seems like way tuned, turn little bit (volume \\\"medium\\\") get best sound. they're quiet seem like Fidelity quite good they're turned little bit more. course last statement subjective. listened Bose Target day sounded good well. can't truly tell one sound better unless front playing exact song source switch back forth really hear it. say reference, sound pretty much term sound quality. far noise cancelling goes, anything constant sound background fans, refrigerator running someone mowing grass outside etc. pretty much anything that's constant sound, soon turn noise cancelling, sound completely killed. Cannot hear all. continue hear people talking hear sound happening TV loud enough (random sounds) greatly muffled. Keep mind noise cancelling work well sound random. go brand. doubt however noise cancelling working working well.I can't say whether bose better. tried store Target, bose sounded same... background sound completely killed able hear people talking although sounded distant/much quieter greatly reduced bass voice (bose/beats same).Also I'm apple Fanboy type either. iPhone, Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus. Pairing Samsung pretty straightforward, hold button 5 second make sure Bluetooth phone picked up.

Battery life 60% box. plugged 5V, 1.5 amp power adapter 10 minutes, using included USB-C cable, headphone bumped 80% battery level. seems quick charge claim 5 hour playback 10 minute charge valid. I've since listened total ~15 hours, battery level showing 30%. battery level change 10% increments. use case, 50% battery loss 15 hour listening = 30 hour assumed playback full charge.

Also, primarily discus pair headphone question relates feature-wise Bose's Quiet Comfort (not QCII) headphone refraining giving many detail others, since read specifically pair individually review posted respective products. reason mainly keep review becoming master's thesis subjective preferences. :)Initial Impression:Starting packaging.

Upon turning Sonys on, greeted woman's voice sound like tin cave speaks. NC kick in, darn good job removing ambient sound muffling people talking somewhat. feel close NC QCs, would still give leg Sonys much noticeable white noise factor playing whereas QC feel like sucked sound atmosphere around you. traveling folk (I primarily wear typical office setting work plenty well for), would say given aggressive, forward, pronounced sound stage Sonys, find blocking sound better car plane without sound (especially lower, bass end) washed out.

First, Sonys bring forward sound. sound stage wide QCs. Instruments get mixed together lost fray. sound Sonys feel akin Beats Studio. bass pronounced punchy may appealing some. prefer balanced clean representation, QCs serve better. turn volume up, Sonys also lose balance become muddy. QCs give impression music playing around you, Sonys feel like they're playing music. (if really want feel like stage music, Sennheiser's HD800S king. HD700 HD660S good job better price, studio headphones, totally different use case begin with.)Where really felt performance shining came Rap, R&B, even EDM/House area. definitely appreciate Sony 2pac, Destiny's Child, Infected Mushroom, Daft Punk. little aggressive music may want finer touch jazz opera. listening Kenny G, David Benoit, Keiko Matsui, get groove, fine detail intricacy instrument sacrificed. Also, sharp trill piano key saxophone bit much higher volumes. visceral in-your-face nature sound also make pretty fun band vein Disturbed, Five Finger Death Punch, Pantera, Metallica. Going bit direction, like Eluveitie Slayer likely give headache unsubdued high thrashing sounds. Taking couple step back going classic rock like Eagles, Journey, Gerry Rafferty, etc., QC perform better, fine Sony's headphones. Finally, listening music gentler atmosphere like Norah Jones, Ray LaMontagne, Ludovico Einaudi, Celtic Woman, would give Bose's QCs Sony liven bit way.Features:Both Sony QC three level NC. High, Ambient sounds, off. QC handle lot better. mid level Sony feel worthless clumsy without audio playing. almost sound better turned off. QC, mid level provides good balance allows wear outside windy day reduced noise wind NC microphone. However, case QC (instead QCII), need app change NC level.The QC claim 20 hour battery, thoroughly proven true year owned them. Sony's claim 30 hours, also found true, nearly long see hold time. Also QCs longer, replace ear pad 2 years. process easy made feel sound new better seal fresh pads. process headphone appears same.Call quality great headphones. also use Skype call laptop work work great. However, one place Sony completely dropped ball. Bose's QCs allow two device connected time, switch seamlessly make great office. laptop phone time. listen music working. meeting time, join Skype call immediately pick up. get call phone, switch back over. done, music ready go. touch anything. Next time turn on, pick backup laptop phone immediately.Both charge fast. minute give couple hour use pinch. also apps. Bose app laid better useful, neither really great even necessary except case Bose able sync two pair Bose headphone play music audio both. may good deal couple seeking watch movie plane something. done couple time work well setup. nice feature favor Bose, really found lot use reality.For Sonys, feature right cup touch controls. fairly slick work better expected. took couple attempt get hang responsive.

Double tap play pause. finally, hold finger right ear cup, turn volume turn external microphone catch ambient sound need talk someone really quick without stopping music. nice feature, personally found much use it. Might useful people bigger city like NYC walking around headphone constantly want take every time need listen moment.Conclusion:Sony's WH-1000XM3 slouch stand price range. someone looking pair headphone solid noise cancelling, flexible diverse performance across genre premium features, go wrong these. dock 4/5 star simply opinion, fall short Bose's QC series price range overall quality balance sound, noise cancellation ability, ability connect two device seamlessly hand extremely handy business people today's multi-device world. Now, brief mention slightly expensive option Bose NC700 Sennheiser Momentum. willing step bit $400 mark, get even better quality, better noise cancelation, premium feel overall better devices. However, propose Sony Bose QCs, would go wrong. majority people, would say extra money worth marginal increase headphones. mostly come preference sound.I try keep review updated time go anything come up.

Keep making awesome products, Skullcandy!\",\"I'm writing review type financial gain bought headphone market value. Naturally opinion expressed mine audio preference may differ yours. pretty good ear sound background home theater audio sale setup. review.After reading many review research probably needed decided Sony Bose top 2 contenders. wife recently bought Amazon Utaxo, good reviews, cheaper, took flight satisfied performance (for price) without comparison headphones. abused BestBuy return policy purchased Sony Bose. store sampled SkullCandy sounded bass-heavy clear, include them. also looked Jabra's, review believed good left well. So, decided top 2 contender theBeats see many people wearing them, Utaxo looking budget set. created spreadsheet help guide used loosely. attached see little testing.If want quick dirty, I'd go Sony. Bose 2nd. Beats 3rd. Utaxo 4th, good product price.Years ago search good wired headphone compared Audio Technica m50x Monster, Senneheiser, Beyerdynamic, Monster, Sol, VModa, SkullCandy others. ended Audio Technica (AT), mention know sound preference. like neutral sound full range v bright bass heavy. Let's start review. detailed reason headphone chose them...Comfort: Bose win marginally. headphone irritate extent Bose, Sony close second. Beats comfortable Audio Techica's (AT), horrible mean Utaxo basically tied beats. moderately comfortable wear Utaxo's entire flight without taking off. (4 hour flight)Passive Isolation: used various white noise, airplane sound, background voices. Again, Bose slight edge Beats trailing. Utaxo comfortable enough, comparison, last place. Utaxo comparable AT's, realize little block out. great.Active Noise Reduction: placed Bose first, hair. family try comparison chose Sony, chose Bose. reduce different frequency hear sound each, depending background noise. excellent. Beats come 3rd close third. Utaxo moderate job, said, happy using plane anything compare to. budget set job. winner absolutely impressive Bose Sony. Maybe tie.Sound: probably important aspect headphone me. spent hour listening different type music. cable connected headphone could quickly go back forth each. No, put SPL meter time ensure volume exact use source material feel pretty good feel sound. end, kept Sony's. perfect audiophile quality really good. similar AT's. found Bose sibilant time female vocal track high frequency them. happened time time deal breaker Bose. Sony neutral, adequate bass over-emphasize higher tones. Less ear fatigue long-run. Beats better expecting. also tendency boost higher tone good bass. Utaxo good enough impressive. Again, fine comparison head head compare favorably. Sony app also equalizer feature super quick easy use, fun (not useful) thing like surround sound, soundstage localization, somewhat gimmicky features, much better Bose.Features: test voice feature headsets. important me. using Sony's weeks, like touch feature ability hear ambient sound placing hand right ear cup. also enjoy Sony app, whereas Bose app lacking. Bose traditional button volume work fine prefer Sony touch interface more. Utaxo standard button well Beats, work intended.Conclusion: Sony Bose close though Bose may slightly comfortable, feature especially Sound Sony pushed towards them. ability equalize fly easily great feature Sony includes app. touch interface user friendly Bose others. Beats fine set I'd pay extra $70 Sony. find pair great price, disappointed. Utaxo, around $60, bargain good set headphones. never chance compare would likely satisfied them. built well, comfortable enough put good enough sound enjoy music video. place distant 4th term isolation. First Place: Sony !!\",\"Aight I've like half year now. Sound-wise they're best wireless noise cancelling headphone get. There's really competitor. Bose equivalent sound like tin can compared these. I've ups down they're expensive headphones, term get actually mad cheap. sound like boutique phone go $1k.Pros:1. Best sound available, really competitor.2. Auto stop start thing pretty cool. get tiny bit annoying wearing glass whatever ear cup totally lined up, really easy turn app.3. Battery life freaking wild. Especially use auto stop / start thing. forget even need charge these. say 21 hour whatever think that's 21 hour use, charge mine maybe month so.4. noise cancellation great. Bose maybe tad better specifically, even cancellation pretty isolating. Active noise cancellation really dopest thing world yet anyways. Bose really going cut repetitive white noise low-end frequencies. tech works, looking cone silence active noise cancelling phone going thing. looking little noise reduction tho at. ANC also effect EQ music listening to, think B&W took extra time make sure extreme these. noticed way frequency loss (frequencies music actually wanted hear haha) Bose ones.5. actually get better B&W release firmware updates. thought major BS first saw haha seem get reliable every time update them.6. look awesome. B&W design always step above, right par. I'm professional musician audio engineer, every time someone come studio see get compliments.Cons:1. start comfortable. Like really don't. almost took back, tried another pair Bose QC35s reminded term sound quality, QC35s probably 60% maximum. Anyways, ear cup headband leather kind padding take bit wear in, mean they're gonna last forever do. pretty much wore hat month two wore (to keep headband head) feel great. give time.2. can't use charged. Even cable. I'm mistaken that's they're active speaker so... that's active speaker work. mention sound ridiculous? Like ridiculously good.3. connection occasionally get jumpy. mine seems turn head way right look way shoulder. Bose issue like tho I'm still these. general bluetooth thing. Also note happens I'm walking around street NYC, might something interference.Anyways that's main stuff right there.

Tested multiple devices, date.To future-proof review (because remember edit review firmware problem addressed), rated 4 star based assumption future fix firmware problems. taking firmware account, think I'd rate 2 star (as 8/31/2022).Pros:These headphone quality sound, probably par price point. significantly better PXC 550-II's, bit depth bass.Their noise cancellation good, good Bose QC35\\u2019s, expected.The battery life incredible. think I'm getting 60 hour (volume kept around 20-40%), they're still awesome.Cons:These nowhere near comfortable Sennheiser PXC 550-II headphones. put pressure ears/temples, headband way firmer. head aching 30 minute use.There significant firmware issue (my firmware date, 8/31/22):When using auto power mode, turn (and sync phone) time they\\u2019re moved. course silence phone\\u2019s alerts, they\\u2019re playing headphone didn\\u2019t mean turn on.When using on-head detection, keep turning they're sitting around neck.Whenever answer phone (iPhone 12 Pro Max) change output headphone hang phone. tried answering using headphone's touch controls, possible would work.While transparency mode nice feature, almost laughable compared AirPod Pro's Sony WF-1000XM4's. sound barely better wearing non-noise cancelling headphones.These connect 2 device time, switching paired (and connected) device (for example: listening audio tablet, get text alert phone, interrupt tablet audio second, switching back tablet again), whenever answer phone, mentioned above, audio quits playing headphones. phone say still connected, show output apps. reconnect phone get working again.Whenever pair new device, disconnect existing connected devices. reconnect afterward.As much want like headphones, Sennheiser fix software issues, worth hassle.\",\"pleasantly surprised headset. usually use Bose's $300+ noise cancelling headphones, wanted something smaller lighter. headphone muffle noise, entirely cancel it. ear, new me, like much.

Massive sound leak, embarrassing train ride.So returned started research new pair would solve issues. stress that, overall, liked sound quality Sony headphones. bass overemphasized, sound quality issue. Fast forward past two month research narrowed two headphone many people seem comparing: Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Ear Wireless Bluetooth Headphones Case - Black Bowers & Wilkins PX. general consensus seemed be: Sony's better app, comfortable, better noise cancelling; Bowers & Wilkins superior sound quality, made better quality materials, 'look better'.For me, sound quality number one concern went Bowers & Wilkins PX. Here's irony set in: find comfortable Sony XB950N1 pair previously owned, sound leakage much le PXs...but sound quality awful. mean awful. keep receiving much praise sound quality blow mind almost everything sound flat. I'll break sampling audio ranges/instruments sound quality headphones:Bass (tested Lil Wayne's \\\"A Milli\\\" Taylor Swift's \\\"Are Ready it?\\\"): average, nothing special. pop bit, song heavy bass bass underrepresented.Female vocal (tested Feist's \\\"1234\\\" She&Him's \\\"You really got hold me\\\"): slightly average. higher vocal range, better pick up.Male vocal (tested Mumford & Sons \\\"Sigh more\\\" TV Radio's \\\"A Method\\\"): average flat. Blends background instruments.Acoustic guitar (tested Bon Iver's \\\"skinny love\\\", Jack Johnson's \\\"Gone\\\" Weezer's \\\"The world turned left here\\\"): pathetically flat. Imagine listening cloth earphone, that's dull flat sound.Synthesizer (tested Michelle Branch's \\\"Fault line\\\" Van Halen's \\\"Jump\\\"): slightly average pop instrument.Piano (Tested Maxence Cyrin's cover \\\"where mind?\\\" Van Halen's \\\"Right now\\\"): flat flat flat.Drums (tested tested numerous songs): surprisingly strong. one instrument really seems shine headphones.So audio quality primary reason buying these, mostly average rarely even average, else really matters? I'll briefly touch aspect headphones.Volume: average! get loud enough quiet room. Even maxed felt like wanted go least one, maybe two notch higher.Noise cancelling: actually decent job cancelling noise without noise cancelling enabled simply well wrap onto head. pleased this, entered environment wanted noise cancelling deal lower audio quality. audio quality already bad enough these, got worse NC enabled.The app: good lord awful. mean straight trash. fact come many options, like equalizer volume control app itself, disappointing. really annoyed easily app (NOT bluetooth connection) disconnected headphones. time would open app would take 30 second sync headphones, switched another app, back homescreen, app LOSES CONNECTION headphone (once again, bluetooth connection, app's sync headphones)! time switch back app wait 30 second re-sync headphones.

However, feel sound signature bright frankly unpleasantly harsh ideal pleasure listening. also use excellent higher end headphone including Sennheiser 800s, along companion Sennheiser headphone amp HDV 820, critical pleasure listening, well Audeze LCD-X headphone use reality check recording process well pleasure listening.With context, enter Beoplay H95. purchased pleasure convenience listening \\u2013 opposed critical listening recording - sometimes noisy home environment (lots nearby heavy construction noise leaf blower nearly every day). seeking pair Bluetooth headphone ANC approached higher fidelity cans. extensive reading review popular Bluetooth ANC headphones, example Sony WH-1000XM4, Bose 700 Apple Air Pods Max decided trial Beoplay H95. Note audition lower cost headphone can\\u2019t realistically compare Beoplay H95. However, compare H95 higher end headphone may interest some.Now, additional important background, use case probably different headphone users. don\\u2019t intend use full size headphone walking outdoors \\u2013 use Apple Airpod Pros this. also don\\u2019t intend use full size headphone ANC commute planes. Again, would use Airpod Pros older pair Bose wired QC20 earbuds this. \\u2013 use case full size Bluetooth ANC headphone use indoors, freeing cable tethering good rig, listening pleasure sometimes noisy environment. ANC, sound quality paramount importance me. feature phone calls, apps, control gestures, voice control, secondary importance me.I\\u2019ve found Beoplay H95 sound signature neutral transparent. clearly fine higher end - expensive - cabled headphones, sound quality H95 offer quite respectable. soundstage fairly expansive, may wide deep Sennheiser 800s (which unusually vast) \\u2013 H95 soundstage quite generous. make spatial location different instruments, example orchestra, better lesser headphones. mid-upper frequency transparent airy, vocals, classical art song (e.g. lieder) sound true engaging. Instrumentals (piano, strings, orchestra) seem pretty accurate well. Bass tight certainly present sufficient quantity classical music. boosted exaggerated might prefer genre music. Recordings I\\u2019ve made (i.e. performer) also seem pretty accurate. course, compare H95 sound good rig, difference readily apparent \\u2013 example Sennheiser 800s great deal body, heft, clarity, liquidity, dynamic range nuance H95 bit lighter weight, somewhat veiled, slightly grainy compressed comparison - feel overall H95 quite respectable job representing reality BT headphone. Again, unreasonable expect BT ANC device perform level much expensive corded audiophile equipment. H95 come surprisingly close however!I noticed others called out, achieve decent listening volume, need dial H95 >70% volume, feel le ideal shouldn\\u2019t necessary. softer classical track need dial 90-100%. suggests isn\\u2019t adequate headroom amplifier. supplied USB-C USB-A cable, intended recharging H95 battery, also used wired connection computer. case, achievable volume much improved compared BT. estimate 50% volume level wired setup similar 70-80% level BT configuration. similar \\u201cboost\\u201d volume occurs using supplied 3.5mm cable source, iPhone 11 (with lighting USB camera adapter), PC. believe sound quality also improved using USB-A USB-C cable, perhaps digital signal PC bypassing DA conversion H95. Another factor low volume output H95 via Bluetooth iPhone EQ. Usually set \\u201cClassical\\u201d majority listening. However, found EQ setting \\u201cNone\\u201d (or \\u201cFlat\\u201d seems equivalent) still excellent sonically needs, volume noticeably louder.I occasion use H95 phone call, sound quite good end. end, sound quality good enough hard hearing elderly person carry conversation better use land line.Regarding ANC \\u2013 agree reviewer dial left earpiece handy immediate control ANC v transparency, would nice physical \\u201cstop\\u201d obvious dial minimized maximized. dial spin freely judge based hearing detect set desired amount ANC. fair, offer audible tone instead physical stop, need learn \\u201cdecode\\u201d different tones. found ANC effective enough minimize noise construction next door open windows, nearby washer/dryer noises, even land line ringing 3 foot away I\\u2019m seated barely audible. Standing outside yard, wood chipper used 2 door fairly noisy one would expect. H95 full ANC without music playing, wood chipper 80+% dampened, still somewhat audible. music low-moderate volume (~40-50%), wood chipper apparent.Other Notes:- dial right earpiece volume brilliant feature opinion. Might easier APM's small knob. Incidentally, small knob Apple Watch control H95 volume listening Apple Music iPhone.- H95 physical shut switch, unlike APM, although H95 ultra long battery life (38 hr ANC 50 hr without ANC) making le critical.- H95 multipoint connection, allowing maintain connection two Bluetooth sources, mean example listen one make call other- H95 two corded options, provided box: 3.5mm 3.5mm cable (analog), USB-C USB-A (digital).- H95 real case, unlike APM. However, feel useful mainly protective case home, practical travel.- Bang & Olufsen app nice essential. find EQ option useful expected. I\\u2019ve settled \\u201cOptimal\\u201d found need change it. variable option didn\\u2019t seem helpful practical. battery level indicator useful degree, due long battery life, doesn\\u2019t come play much. PC Bluetooth section, battery level also indicated. volume level adjusted H95 dial right earcup app needed this. app little glitchy iPhone \\u2013 even though paired (appears Settings>Bluetooth music play through) app sometimes paradoxically cannot detect H95. delete reinstall app once. app computer (just mobile devices) sometimes Bluetooth connection PC glitchy drop outs.SummaryWhile fair expect Beoplay H95 would perform level corded audiophile headphone costing much more, believe B&O right thing count optimize fine sound quality. significant downside relatively lower volume level, requiring cranking volume >70%. Whatever suggests amplifier design relative lack headroom, deal breaker mind. even though H95 much expensive every BT ANC headphone currently available, attaining high level sound quality worthwhile. course, person must make his/her assessment decision based sound goal personal financial situation.\",\"regular headset, fantastic.

La comodidad e muy buena, la almohadillas son suaves muy moldeables, pero al ser de un relleno tan suave pierden ese sello para evitar que el sonido escape con el movimiento de la cabeza, se siente como flojo el aud\\u00edfono. En cuando al sonido, muy claro, cristalino con mucho detalle, con la suficiente cantidad de bajo agudo, pero con un \\u00e9nfasis especial en los medios. Debido que son aud\\u00edfonos cerrados con ese resalte en medios veces el sonido se escucha como encajado, embotellado, se como explicarlo, pero del todo natural. El espacio en el sonido e bastante amplio los lados, pero profundo, eso hace que en ciertas canciones los instrumentos se sientan apretados amontonados, la separaci\\u00f3n instrumental e su fuerte. El cable con microfono e muy funcional, contestado llamadas escuchan sin problemas, asi que un plus en ese sentido, esto los hace unos todo terreno, escuchar musica, ver peliculas, videojuegos, tambien los veo como buena opci\\u00f3n para estudio.Est\\u00e1n muy bien construidos aunque totalmente hechos en pl\\u00e1stico, pero se siente barato ni hacen ruidos al manipularlos, con piezas f\\u00e1cilmente reemplazables, lo que ayuda para que te duren muchos a\\u00f1os de uso.En resumen de nuevo, unos aud\\u00edfonos muy vers\\u00e1tiles, con buena calidad de sonido, que creo te duraran muchos a\\u00f1os, que son tal vez la mejor compra en este rango de los 100 dolares.\",\"Die Kopfh\\u00f6rer sind zwar g\\u00fcnstig, sollten aber funktioniern.\",\"Son unos excelentes auriculares, clasicos pero fiuncionan correctamente.

I\\u2019m noob audiophile probably 4th product I\\u2019ve listened actually hi-if quality. ordered 1 Tripple Drivers compare sent back preferred X2s. headphone compare Sennheiser 558s. I\\u2019ve also heard great speaker system. curious powering Oppo HA-2 IPhone using MP3 file (I know, I\\u2018m scum use FLAC\\ud83e\\udd19). Highs- quite good. detail equal 558s X2s weren\\u2019t impactful organic sounding Sennheisers were. high definitely better 1 Tripple Drivers (over ears) although definitely better cymbals. Overall clarity like upper guitar female vocal definitely go X2s. said don\\u2019t care much high mostly listen alternative rock mostly male vocals. high priority I\\u2019d advise check something Senheiser, maybe 58X, they\\u2019re known great dynamic top end resolution I\\u2019ve read heard. Midds: midds actually better expected. They\\u2019re recessed expected review good detail clarity. 558s definitely win X2s vocal guitar chord hit lot impact slightly better detail ear, it\\u2019s close. midds mile ahead 1 Tripples sound quite bit muddy closed balanced lot V sound X2s. overall midds leave desired better expected.

Although coated almost stiff plastic, complaint cable. headband, also incredibly durable, able withstand horrible abuse. fact, conducted experiment. actually grabbed two cup headphone, bent backwards headphone completely straight flat line form. that, bent headband tight loop. this, headband looked functioned exactly before, absolutely obvious wear damage.

Although, Beyer definitely worst, definitely best come adjustment. interesting thing headphone though, even fully adjusted eighth dot, headphone really big. mean? means, close way in, absolutely tiny, great storage display. reason, look even fantastic tiny form, again, another opinion.--------------------Initial Comfort:This headphone differ other. first, let explain initial comfort. people know Beyerdynamic headphone comfortable. happy report, true -- extent. earpads soft indeed, feel good wearing them. headband generously padded well, find comfortable too. slight problem headphone term comfort -- especially DT880. First let clarify may problem user small ears. u medium large ears, slight problem. earcups headphone really quite shallow. which, ear likely touching inner foam earcups. many problem, some, end world. interesting thing is, DT880 \\\"curved\\\" foam inside earcup DT990 \\\"flat\\\" foam inside earcup. extremely apparent wearing them, taking earpads, clear stated. mean is, ear much likely touch, irritated inside foam wearing DT880, DT990. Putting back forth reveals issue obvious, DT990 clearly step ahead DT880 term comfort -- real shame, DT880 sound superior DT990. said, DT990 feel absolutely fantastic first placed head. pillow-like feel, relatively soft headband make joy wear.Long Term Comfort:Many overlook something important long term comfort. look initial shock comfortable headphone is, leave that. Unfortunately, headphone ever owned feel even half hour put -- excluding king comfort, AD700. matter soft, good feel first put on, feel different extended wear. said, DT880 began irritate le half hour. ear like semi-claustrophobic earcups, really detested foam. DT990 hand, even initial wear, quite obvious comfortable road -- were. Unfortunately, worn little le hour, that, still felt pretty good. may even keep long anyway, case, DT990 pass test flying colors. Sadly DT880, curved foam inside earcup disabled wearing anywhere near long DT990. sad fact indeed, already mentioned liked sound DT880 load DT990. go onto next section.--------------------Bass:And come section DT880 DT990 differ most. sound. Let's start basic begin bass. two, quite apparent bass indeed different. Instead putting confusing term long descriptions, I'll put nice simple. DT990 bass, DT880 LESS bass. Yup, simple, self-explanatory. DT880 \\\"safe\\\" bass, happy bass offer. much, little, thus perfect amount. definitely agree extent. two headphones, DT880 favorable bass. songs, little, DT990 much. DT880's bass safe -- sound perfectly acceptable fatiguing, all. deep, balanced, clear. DT990 hand, bit risky. indeed bass, find fatiguing, love addition it. play safe could keep one bass alone, would choose DT880 question. fun listening, rock sessions, laid back, analytical examining, would still pick DT880 categories.Treble Overall Sound:This storm begins. treble without doubt, trademark Beyerdynamic headphones. bright, energetic, detailed -- thanks overemphasized treble. get strength, also get weakness. much treble. Far much. I'm writing comparison obviously compare review DT880 DT990, criticize sound based listening HD650, hear hear, share findings. DT880 DT990 simply bright tastes. brightness also come detail energy, also come dryness, lack body, hollow sound. actually reminds Grado headphone way upfront engaging sound. Due this, find fatiguing listening both, find enjoyable due something \\\"left out\\\" sound. describe this, give mental image general sound signature. \\\"higher\\\" equaling \\\"treble\\\" \\\"lower\\\" equaling \\\"bass\\\", Beyer's sound resembles \\\"upside pyramid\\\". Little support bottom, much weight top. Due shape, sound like mentioned, sound dry, lack body, relatively hollow sound -- sharp detailed sound. But, information describing Beyer general sense, DT880, give glimpse strange, twisted world DT990.After discovering DT880 bright compared reference HD650, completely forget also compare DT990. tested DT880 v HD650 extensively, tested DT880 DT990 briefly past (I quickly came conclusion found DT880's sound superior DT990, discarded DT990 temporarily). So, extensive test DT880 HD650, coming conclusion DT880 bright, went ahead threw DT990 back mix. Let's say, blown away sheer amount treble presented. was, short, appalling. incredibly bright, rendered almost unlistenable variety music threw it. brightness come sibilance, sibilance come fatigue. sound DT990 bright, felt covering detail music. Instead sound \\\"veiled\\\" like \\\"tinned\\\", everything sound bright shimmer, seemed detract overall enjoyment. But, make thing even interesting, DT990 enhanced bass well. bit much bass blur mids, WAY much treble eats rest spectrum! incredibly twisted sound ask me, many may find amusing! Overall, headphone extremely bright lack bodied, balanced sound. DT990 take next level -- offering even brighter sound, bass also render fatigued listening. all, DT990 strange (and preferred) headphone indeed. Getting fatigued bass treble time really quite experience! DT880 \\\"tamed\\\" DT990, that, sound much better kind music.--------------------Recommendation:Whatever do, try first that's option. Beyerdyanmic headphone give mixed reaction headphone ever tried, that, really try listen possibly compare, buy. that's option, think words: bright, dry, upfront, energetic, detailed might engage you, go ahead buy DT880, unless feeling extremely courageous want risk DT990. But, feel like want more: balanced, emotional, full bodied, complete, unobtrusive, smooth sound, strongly recommend fabulous HD650. Whatever decide, remember, warned DT990, still choose get it, may ear endure sound...\",\"Purchased replace pair Sony ear headphone lost sound one side (loose wire go headphone)I work computer programming 8+hrs day listen music work. prefer noise cancelling headphone help drown chatter office type setting distracting trying concentrate.

They've got rich, detailed, full, wide sound work well genre. sounded great everything threw them: Beethoven, Daft Punk, Andrew Bird, Killers, Kanye, Muse. thing good deal bass bump overpower mids highs. coming cheap pair headphones, hear detail never heard before. listening low-quality mp3s bitrates lower 192kbps, probably hear detail wish didn't. Considering headphone cost around $50, simply complaint sound quality.Note \\\"burn-in\\\": spent time researching headphones, probably come across term. basically break-in period wherein play either tone music louder-than-normal listening volume period time achieve broken-in sound sooner; people swear improves sound quality others think hogwash. leaning towards latter decided give try anyway. around 30hrs discontinuous break-in, honestly notice difference. Whether sound actually changed, sound great now.HA-RX700 v HA-RX900-------------------Like me, seems lot people fence pair pick up. decided order pair headphone see compare. look same, save higher-quality material used 900s' headband earcups addition plastic-y mesh ring. 900s definitely get nod comfort styling, landslide. term performance, is. I've read many forum post review claiming 700s sound clear balanced. recall, described sound 900s rich, full, wide bass bump overpower. 700s none qualities. customer describe clear balanced come across cold, bland, narrow compared 900s. rapid-fire comparison switching headphone various song various genres, preferred 700s exactly zero percent time. comparison. comparative lifelessness reason returned 700s kept 900s. I'd recommend saving step getting 900s straight away.Conclusion-----------Pros: Sound quality, comfort, build quality, styling, priceCons: Size (wear indoors), cable length (use twist tie)These headphone sound great, feel great, look great, reasonable price. disappointed.Leave question comment I'll glad respond them!\",\"2022-04-18 MonI am: Broadcaster Musician Acoustic Engineer Loudspeaker Engineer Recording EngineerHeadphone requires >2h burn in. headphone terribly muddy....After two weeks:PROS+ Good isolation+ Good noise cancelling+ Great articulation relative BlueTooth headphones, especially bass, rolloff.+ Comfortable >10h.+ 5 Year Warranty+ Good BluetoothCONS\\u2013 terrifically LOUD, barely sufficient cases.\\u2013 clamp head sufficiently anything strenuous outdoors.\\u2013 Bass Heavy, absolutely atrocious set.

Let's first clear something... audio equipment unlike equipment market often spend exponentially money item gain minor, incremental increase important criteria. speaker X sound better speaker Y, thing equal. likely speaker X cost more. time cost more, time. much cost much quality sound receiving additional cost? almost always matter diminishing returns... load money bit firmer bass slightly clearer treble. nirvana seek audio equipment.Over last year purchased two set headphones: Grado 80e Sennheiser Momentum. Clearly Grado's $100 least expensive Momentum jumping markedly $299, recently acquired Sennheiser HD600 hit $400 mark. Comparing first two purchases, 80e's Momentum's, difference pretty straight-forwarded. Grado's sounded brighter good bass sligthly harsh mids (\\\"smeared\\\" word came mind compared listening test home). Mometum's sounded laid back (not bright) great bass (that could bit smeared upper bass) definitely superior mids (thinking men's voice - became painfully obvious using live track Morrissey two headphones). came find using pair different purposes.The Grado 80e's became preferred classical music (a genre becoming deeply involved late) felt, personal preferences, brighter quality enhanced instrument typical classical music, bass sufficient. wanted rock (or alternative often case) broke Momentum's. accentuated, overblown bass, quite welcome noticed le laid back nature treble, especially used more.But also recent purchase better home audio equipment (Marantz CD6005 CD player SoundEngine D1 DAC/Headphone amp computer - listening ALAC encoded tracks) found thinking Momentum 80e somehow lacking. getting everything could music via better equipment.From research done previously elected spend money purchase HD600. think found single bad review Internet sphere. thought little warm laid back. every review hit upon how, especially money, HD600s hit right note (sorry). burned 30-hours listening test began. considered purchase principally classical music. really think I'd get rock/alternative already getting Momentums classical CDs came plugged CD player. also plugged Grados Marantz A/V receiver, direct mode engaged. Adjusting volume best could (this hardly scientific) played handful familiar track familiar CDs; swapping back forth HD600s Grado 80e.It almost time hear difference. I'll concede sometimes difficult put word difference heard, I'll try. first thing noticed violins. number playing note together Grado's sounded smeared compared HD600s. unlike poorly created JPEG digital point-n-shoot versus well-made JPEG original RAW processed via Adobe Lightroom. Details lost former, latter far superior job keeping detail even process losing information. HD600 left feeling like actually sitting room musicians. I'm referring placement instrument (the HD600 good job, I've read review can better), simply clear, precise, concise live-sounding violins. Actually, true stringed instruments. resonance strings... clear nature... welcome astonishing difference.Granted, Grado's one-quarter cost surprised HD600's sounded better. Markedly better. listen long hard notice differences. obvious; subtle. said, can't say every displeased Grado's. comparison HD600's became possible hear understand Grado's limitations.And like stringed instruments, voice also became sharper, clearer, focused. found looking regarding classical music interests: pair headphone generally neutral (which would consider 'flat' flat has, think, negative connotation), boring flat. feel music alive ever comparison Grado's.So... also broke rock alternative music (the recently remastered Led Zeppelin discs, Nine Inch Nails Pet Shop Boys) see HD600's could do. feared Momentum would kick butt thanks fuller bass, must say HD600's continued impress. good thing brought mid higher frequency (clarity, precision) still present, but, surprisingly, bass rock solid well. may hate saying it, think bass bit better. upper-bass bloat Momentum's appear HD600's, tends make lower-bass stand overwhelmed enhanced upper-bass. I'd still say Momentum's punch like listening rock alternative, could find readily using HD600's often Smiths, Cure, Skinny Puppy, etc. would Momentum's.And think found excellent trio headphones. Finding one perfect pair headphone need opportunity probably impossible. think accidentally stumbled upon excellent hat trick can meet various needs. like listen music I'm go; need portability. truly portable headphones, Grado's classical (and still quite reasonable rock alternative) Momentum's rock alternative (I confess like much classical Grado's rock alternative), HD600's critical, at-home listening audio equipment enough amplifier ooomph properly push them.Add name voice long list folk think, dollar dollar, Sennheiser HD600 best value headphone there.\",\"technical review explain give example HD650 excellent headphone are.

Onto HD428. little bit distortion looseness heard lower bass area progress quite evenly around 3 4kHz quite big noticeable drop, come back 10kHz gently roll rest highs. pink noise tilted towards warmth lower frequency bit louder higher ones. Though Headroom's graph show weak bass response HD428, take account human ear interprets low frequency resonance inside closed ear cups. (A quick sweep 3 second chirp also reveals echo-knock inside right cup). Bass quite tight, lack real impact weight (except fabric material tickling ears), even though give impression little bass 650 due resonance (but resonance affect perception low frequency transients). least 428 harsh low mid treble 598! seems like 650 subdued, mellow recessed response low treble beyond that, surprisingly clean sounding price! treble articulate 598s. think represents superb value along HD448 HD449 pleasant long listening session offend ear like strident HD598.So know HD650 actually balanced frequency response (which also relates good dynamics), distortion. summed briefly: headphone's distortion inaudible! mean pure, clean, smooth, full-bodied sound natural harmonic being heard leading accurate timbre, high resolving ability detail retrieval since there's discernible garbage introduced transducer. clear precise differentiation frequency octaves.

Also, song whose average volume range -12dB -18dB FS showcase excellent micro macro dynamic effortless sound projection headphones. majority pop, rock, dance music mid-1990s hover range, whereas nowadays music unfortunately compressed loud overall level hardly dynamic range.Next physical inspection transducers.

Whether real-life acoustic synthesized music, sense soundstage size different song realistic way that's absolutely natural also true source.Don't get caught Sennheiser's marketing say 45 degree angled baffle automatically create speaker-like sound may create sighted expectation bias. There's near negligible difference radiating point mono signal listened angled (HD598) straight (HD650) baffle design headphones. Yet HD650 easily beat HD598 width, depth, height, separation even though angled drivers. I'll explain spatial sound superb. 650 close-tolerance driver (max. 1 dB difference) meaning left right channel nearly identical phase (time) frequency (amplitude) response, required good imaging. regard, HD650's transducer reproducing electrical signal (i.e. source) much greater accuracy. Pink noise perfectly centered without slight shift towards left like two headphones. sine sweep also centered way 20Hz 20kHz pan left right upper mids treble like lower-end models. compared models, stereo playback HD650 solid phantom center present (thanks constantly centered sine sweep), left right channel simultaneously heard separately outside pinna (instead ear). Remember \\\"stereo\\\" derived Greek word \\\"solid.\\\" what's solid what's middle.Elaborating bit previous statements, center portion mix *distinct* experienced *separate* sound placed towards left right *simultaneously* occurring. asterisk denote difference HD650, precision-manufactured drivers, HD598, not. example, Madonna's \\\"Dress Up\\\", beginning part say \\\"you've got style\\\" reverb tail \\\"style\\\" left right separate main center HD650, HD598. slight pan shift sweep result lack stability stereo imaging performance. instance, Phil Collins' Another Day Paradise, chorus, \\\"Cause another day you, paradise\\\" HD428 shift \\\"me\\\" left center compared \\\"you\\\", since former upper mid sound latter lower mid sound. HD650 flaw here. phase information music (e.g. reverberation instrument hall classical music) seem wide open. totally open chassis design allows sound radiate without contributing reflections.The HD650's earcups utilize polyamide 6 glass-fiber construction (PA6 GF) quiet solid gloss black portion adjacent earpads lightly tapped fingernail. Likewise, nice distinctive stainless steel clang heard tapping grille headphone worn held. thing HD598 (which utilizes conventional ABS plastic) reveals hollow plastic sound. Indeed, attribute (lack resonance housing) along aforementioned driver matching contributes sense transparency HD650's stereo imaging, pure audio image consists time level difference formed mind.It's also finally worth mentioning HD650, since distortion low, reveal relatively high distortion tube amps. \\\"scaling expensive amps\\\" mentioned opening paragraph essentially mean listening various amount second harmonic distortion tube amps. personally would recommend pairing HD650 nice solid-state amp. matter much amp costs, getting one measure well (flat response, distortion noise), near zero output impedance, provides enough voltage (anything 2 3 volt RMS range absolutely sufficient) powerful exciting dynamic range. audio industry, higher priced gear always translate better performance. industry strange thing going now, like ridiculous price difference high-end models. Considering bought HD428, HD598, HD650 new Amazon last year $50, $180, $350 respectively, seems bit odd next two model cost $1000 $1500.The HD650 full well-balanced frequency response, extremely low distortion clean, pure, smoothly detailed sound even high listening levels. discernible diaphragm earcup resonance would otherwise produce peak mid-range treble response wonderful, naturally open spatial sound. Sennheiser may never voice reference headphone nicely ever least long time come. ask?

Mounted/affixed middle the/a headphone-cups. engineering/physics perspective, mean pushing/pressing force exerted headband cup centered middle cups, opposed top cup's--which invariably result pushing pressure towards top cup (assumptions based XM5's design).Third. Comfort. somewhat flat headband padding forgettable pressure supply cup side one's (average size) head sufficient -- maybe little lite side. Also, inside (head side) headband rubbery-like material, fear hair/scalp oil dirtying fabric there.Lastly, subjective review sound, ANC, call quality. think sound amazing! ANC super cool.

Pass-through mode also quite nice, though sometimes other's voice may sound quite (again, due using half volume).Call quality great. held phone call wherein fan blowing head (wind noise). Neither caller could hear noise fan.Since owning headphones, Sennheiser released firmware update ANC. update cannot empirically say I've notice difference.

Another thing REALLY attracted REMOVABLE locking cable. I've trouble previous headphone jack ended go buy new jack stripping cable solder on, seemed like pretty sweet feature save future trouble.Picking Right Set Cans:I research good studio oriented headphone below(or at) $100 price point. came finding these(Shure SRH440), Sennheiser HD280 Pros, Sony MDR-v6's and/or 7506's. obviously came choosing these. POST ORDERFirst Impressions:I watched unboxing review video Shures see I'd getting, nothing box VISUALLY surprised seen already, took plastic bag actually held hand myself, lovestruck. nice heavy(in good way) solidly built.Build:Like said before, quite hefty weight, also size. (Which like lot, looking smaller, lighter cans, think want go) plastic used headphone solid high quality. guess taken build previous set headphone using fair, grabbed earcups pulled apart blown away well thing made.The headband made flexible material covered synthetic leatherette, feel sturdy yet moldable. sits nicely atop head.From gathered moment stock earPADS one headphone took replace upgraded SRH840 pad bought time these, okay quality. tad stiff though.The cable nice, thick coiled one around 10 foot long start SINGLE side headphone rather Y-cable, terminates 3.5 mm/ 1/8 gold plated jack.The jack threaded end screw included 1/4 (whatever equivalent millimeters) adapter. rubber/plastic end nice grippy part make easy hold plug whatever need to. small detail, found quite nice.Comfort:Like said short way previous paragraph, bought set replacement earpads normally go big brother product, SRH840, suggestion people experience headphones. tried stock pad swapped like people said, pad fairly stiff shallow. Immediately thereafter put pads. thicker, softer, comfortable. noticeably difference would say though padding INSIDE pad cover driver. much thicker better quality. long wearing session see much bearable. I've also heard claim pad improving sound quality, actually listen swapped pad can't confirm them. ** also pretty prominent(sticky-outy) ear usually become discomforted quite soon putting headphones, (now anyways) deep enough thick enough inner padding much problem.The headband quite \\\"cushy\\\" form rather nicely head. sometims, wearing long time, top head begin get sore rest upon head.These headphone actually pretty tight gripping (seemingly) normal sized head. like LOT, I'm sure bother hell people. I've heard people calling loose, me.Overall, feel nice sitting head.Now greatest fear ordering headphones,Sound/Sound Quality:I previously listened studio oriented headphone seemed \\\"canny\\\" fit closed back headphone STEREOtype(pun), hate wait unnecessarily things, afraid ordering actually listening cause would sound crappy. I'll tell right now, fear misplaced. SRH440's sounded pretty darn good first listen. still burnt full 100 hour suggested many, sound great already. high nice crisp, mids warm smooth, bass lush extended. currently playing pink noise assorted sound them, days(with breaks, worry) hey, maybe they'll sound even better.As far isolation outside noise goes, Shures quite well. I'll give example well it:I've really loud music playing speaker room, put earmuff block sound. Obviously completely shut sound, made quiet enough unbearable hear.The soundstage actually pretty wide spacey. Things panned hard left right sound spread apart closed back headphones. heard lot compare (especially open backed/open-air headphone supposed broadest soundstage), headphone give awesome stereo image listening music.If describe headphone two words, would these:SUPERIOR VALUE.Well there's two cents.

Bluetooth always little finicky headphone connect almost flawlessly. automatically reconnect last device make thing go LOT faster! Switching device pretty simple too.Using included aux cord effect sound quality all. Good conserving battery life particularly need wireless feature time listening!Overall, I'm satisfied purchase. well worth money would recommend headphone anyone everyone! questions, leave comment I'll get back soon possible.EDIT:As mentioned above, I've owned headphone little year I'm still impressed. Even 1 entire year extensive use (multiple road trips, whole school year backpack, recording, listening, calling) still work flawlessly I've ZERO major problem whatsoever. Long story short, I'm still sticking 5 star review. little detail:Physical: physical damage all. try take care stuff, accident happen headphone sustained scratches, dents, cracked despite heavy usage. foam-ish headband piece still hold shape. earphone still fluffy squishy (no tear deformities). point 1 year ownership, little piece fabric \\\"L\\\" (inside left ear cup; cover electronics such) started slipping out, able finagle back there's problem since. use case basically whenever transport headphone that's probably main reason they've maintained physical integrity.

Bose SoundLink headphones, natural noise cancelling good. block majority background noise outsider cannot hear music (unless turned high... that!). active noise cancelling headphones, almost magical. put headphone dead silent. headphone perfect are, afford it, go pair Bose headphone active noise cancelling. suggestion.Tip: use headphone mixing (which I'll update sound comparison part review get new DT770 Pro's), make sure use custom aux cable provided. ensures there's Bluetooth interference get clearest sound quality. studio headphones, want headphone use combination studio monitor (as reference listening device) need good pair monitor headphone double comfort/listening headphones, work great.\",\"I've headphone almost 6 month far, complaints. noise cancellation close perfect realistically get. battery life absolutely insane; count one hand amount time I've actually charge them. design also really sleek they're comfortable wear. sound also immersive plenty loud yet still pierce ear damage hearing even full volume.

Returned refund\",\"I'll start stating replacing older pair active noise canceling headphone used 5-6 hours/day past four year varying office environments. old pair plastic swivel attaching ear cup head band finally broke thousand time (literally, math) placing taking case.As mentioned use headphone primarily office environment listen music (I'm software developer) and/or block constant hum HVAC systems, etc. I've reading countless review numerous headphone looking something fit need much consideration settled QC25's.The main thing took consideration looking replacement headphone were: comfort, sound quality, noise cancelation, noise leakage, craftsmanship/durability, battery life, case, style, feature (wireless/playback control/etc), price. Here's QC25 rates:Comfort - 5/5 - comfortable non-studio headphone ever worn. fairly light weight large over-ear design. ear cup also fairly deep there's contact ear ear piece all. cup rotate allow wear comfortably head however desire. material ear cup soft foam filled leather apply much pressure side head (I wear glass ear comfort utmost importance me). also foam filled suede material top headband making headphone rest comfortably head.Sound Quality - 5/5 - Excellent well balanced. looking headphone amplify low highs, you. want solid lows, crisp high pronounced mid-range look further. headphone play music as-is let control equalization feel necessary best listening experience. suppose thumping base listening mobile device support custom equalization may better different brand.Noise Cancelation - 5/5 - first thing got pop included battery walk furnace room (the furnace running) see impact profound. far outperformed previous noise canceling headphone (which shabby). work sit near call center typically 4-6 people phone busier times. also heat pump unit ceiling hum buzz throughout day (especially since temperature single digit past several weeks). second flip switch humming buzzing gone without trace. call center noise also greatly reduced (I'd say 70% quieter without headphone on) point hard time focusing one conversation. course remedied turn music awesome sound quality completely drowns remaining distractions. frequently colleague walk jumping jack get attention even hear knocking desk I'm \\\"in zone\\\".Noise Leakage - 4/5 - One slight disappointment QC25 level noise leakage (the amount sound heard people nearby). comfortable listening level noise leakage heard 4-5 foot away. like listen music loud, expect people 10 foot away (in quiet environments) sing along tunes. I'm currently cubicle environment closest person 5 foot away, however previous office sat 3 foot another guy divider definitely would issue (except wore headphone day well ;).Craftsmanship/Durability - 5/5 - couple pair headphone compare look like made well. joint swivel made metal part fastened screws. headband made metal ribbon surrounded plastic. cup internals covered rugged cloth (as opposed foam covering often disintegrates extended use). ear cup foam filled leather material seems durable (same style old headphone lasted 4+ years). Even cord made sturdy gold-plated ends. flex well seem like would last long time even larger heads. (I friend ate headphone due large head).Battery Life - 4/5 - far battery life acceptable. noise canceling feature typically 6-8 hour day find far I've gone 2-3 day swapping batteries. also using older rechargeable battery probably life did. completely drained standard AAA battery see much life get those. battery life comparable old headphone (which battery came from) sufficient needs.Case - 4/5 - carrying case included headphone sturdy nice look/feel it. headphone fold rather small fit neatly case leaving enough room included headphone cable maybe adapter two. elastic pouch back side case designed storing instruction manual thin item (perhaps extra cable?). obsessive use headphone small USB powered AAA batter charger fit perfectly old case...when battery low could pull charger charge battery backup headphones...not new case. Fortunately almost always use headphone macbook pro keep battery charger laptop bag need it. Aside that, case compact include little slot spare battery (one AAA included) well airplane adapter.Style - 5/5 - black design like them. I'm style buff come headphone certainly want big ugly thing head. sleek undertone teal cup in-line playback controller. plastic brushed style overall pleased look.Features - 4/5 - feature passively looking headphone wireless capabilities. show stopper me, course, since came wired headphone typically always desk using them. Again, use walking listening music phone music player can't speak experience. inline playback control consists small (1.25\\\" long) control three buttons. volume button, volume button center button control playback. single press center button play/pause music, double-tap button skip next track triple-tap skip previous track. already keyboard control functionality imagine listening music device (that support inline playback controls) would convenient.Price - 4/5 - want less? quality package get price fair. looking exceptional pair headphone great noise canceling, great sound decent feature great option consider.Overall - 4.5/5 - would recommend anyone mind wired audio source mind anyone within reach able hear they're listening to. I'm extremely satisfied purchase would buy again.\",\"Bose headphone noise suppression first, sound fidelity second. it\\u2019s sound fidelity want, buy comparably priced studio monitor headphone without noise suppression.I\\u2019ve owned worn every iteration Bose noise-canceling headphone last 20 year jet cabin noise suppression.

Prior purchasing Studio3 headphones, using Apples AirPods (v1). replace daily driver, needed three thing pair headphones:1). Better sound quality, ANC (active noise canceling);2). Better Bluetooth connectivity area MacBook Mac Mini surrounded metal (introducing interference);3). Faster connection easier swapping device (MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV)SOUND QUALITYI listen wide range music--from rap rock nature sounds; part job, I'm video chat (hangouts, meet, etc). Overall, Studio3 headphone work expected regardless I'm using microphone clear.The sound quality Studio3 headphones, however, noticeably better worse headphone I've used lower price points. catch deal Studio3 did, make price point little tolerable. nearly $350 time review, sound quality main reason purchase use case similar mine.BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITYThis really Studio3 headphone shine! comparison AirPods similar Bluetooth devices, Apples W1 chip amazing keep connected. existing setup, Mac Mini server rack made solid steel despite every Bluetooth device dropping le 10ft (3.05 m) away, thanks W1 chip, Studio3 remain connected even wall headset Mac Mini. able roam 25ft (7.62 m) 30ft (9.14 m) started drop.DEVICE SWAPPINGWhile likely due ecosystem (Apple), Studio3 pair near instantly device I've tested. paired Mac Mini, quickly pair Apple TV, iPad, iPhone seconds. comparison, AirPods quick, though seem get \\\"confused\\\" way prevents able speed.CHARGE / CHARGINGThe Studio3 headphone easily get entire day work single charge, ANC enabled.

Unless adapter (USB-A => USB-C), need another charger charge headphones. burden honestly add need carry.OVERALLThe Studio3 headphone get pretty solid 4 stars. really prevents 5-Star, opinion, boil two things:1). Use micro USB instead USB-C, and;2). ear pad leatherFor need do, work extremely well beat AirPods every way imaginable.

Thankfully initial assumption incorrect, adapter unscrewed revealing 3.5 mm plug, although must say quality adapter fooled me. super nice fit cable seamlessly!The fabric removable ear pad made kind strange, almost like felt material shininess it. Nevertheless comfortable price, general comfort headphone quite good. self-adjusting headband whatnot straight-up clone AKG K240s, certainly bad thing case. Samson done fantastic job replicating design K240s also managing keep cost low. non-removable cable bit downside, included cable high quality quite long. Seriously I've never seen gold-plated connector look feel good. Australian drummer said \\\"they're symphony plastic, AvE taught plastic created equal\\\". statement definitely true here, plastic Samson used SR850s definitely higher quality side. headband fake leather support house audio cable driver made metal (maybe aluminum?).Now, onto sound quality. Honestly seen heard great review headphone expecting quite amazing. Maybe dramatic expected, first pair legitimately good budget headphones. \\\"sound stage\\\" 3D feel sound definitely there, playing video game gunfire engine definitely feel openness semi open back design. particularly enjoy running around Skyrim SE them.I say bass crazy heavy, looking frequency response graph headphone they're actually somewhat bassy higher end true open back headphones. fine though, like base understand concession made headphone good soundstage.

(Looking Beats Raycons!) can't really find descriptive word describe mids highs, I'm really novice come audio. Maybe just... they're great!As far durability go I've day can't say much think they'll stand long term. say non-removable cable definitely downside far durability goes, really invested keeping SR850s alive handy soldering iron see reason add aux connector connector. headband metal support seem quite sturdy given price, expect last year come.
